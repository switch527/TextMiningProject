 Overview: 
 Backed by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk and a host of big-name in          vestors, Tesla Motors was the  first company to commercially prod uce a 
 highway-capable, fully-electric vehicle (EV) . With access to $465 million in low-intere    st loans from the US Dept. of Energy, Te      sla recently 
 acquired a production facility on the cheap  and seeks to leverage its proprietary el ectric powertrain technology to produce a l ine of mainstream 
 EVs, starting with the launch of its Model S luxury sedan in      2012.  Initially targeting a 1% share of the global premium sedan      market, the 
 company plans to use a common powertrain platform to support a diversified line of vehicles. 
  
 Rating Rationale: 
 Tesla's successful commercialization of its high-performance Road ster provides proof-of-concept for its on-the-come mass market  products and 
 helped build the company's brand without a significant marketing in vestment.  Though a low interest  loan from the DOE will help  offset cash 
 burn, the company faces substantial execution  risk in launching its luxury sedan, which will be manufactured at a much larger s       cale and faces 
 uncertain demand in a nascent end market.  Additionally, multiple major auto firms plan to roll out competing EVs by 2011. 
  
 Business: 
 Designs and manufactures high-performance   fully electric vehicles (88%) and advanced          EV powertrain components (12%).  Its two-s        eat 
 convertible Roadster, introduced in late 2008, is the first an  d currently only federally-complia nt, highway capable EV produced  at commercial 
 scale.  Has sold over 1,200 Roadsters to customers in 28 countries,  primarily in the US and Europe (intl sales are 56%).  Road ster has a lithium 
 ion battery pack with capacity of 53 kwh and a range of 236 mile  s on a single charge.  Base price is $109,000 before $7,500 fed  eral tax credit.  
 Model S is a four-door, five-passenger luxury sedan with rang  e options between 160-300 miles and a base price of $57,400 before          federal tax 
 credits; the company has already received 2,800 refundable reserv ations with commercial production slated for 2012.  Vehicles c an recharge in 7 
 hours on a household appliance outlet (40 amp/240 volt) or 4.5 hours on a specially-installed 70 amp/240 volt high power connection.   Sells and 
 services vehicles directly via a network of  13 major market stores (<5,000 sq. ft.); p lans to increase network to 50 stores in  coordination with the 
 Model S launch.    Currently, Roadster body and chassis are manufa      ctured at a Lotus-owned facility in England.  In May 2010, pu     rchased an 
 existing production facility in CA from a Toyota/GM joint ve nture for $42 million; targets initial annual production of 20,000  Model S units and 
 capacity can be increased to 50,000 with minimal capex.   Is tr ansitioning its powertrain component manufacturing to its Palo A lto facility.   Has 
 been approved for $465 million in DOE loans, which will cover 80%   of eligible costs for manufacturing build-out.  Plans to roll  out a suite of 
 EVs over time, including a lower price point model (~$30k) in 2014 or later.  Holds 14 patents and 97 applications.

 Latest Results and Outlook 
 
 Recent Financial Trends: 
 For the three months ended June 2010, sales grew 5% despite a 23%                   decline in Roadster volume, whic  h was more than offset by a 2              4% 
 improvement in Roadster ASP and the commencement of development reve nues from Daimler ($4.4 million).  Gross margin improved to  22%, 
 compared with 8% in the 2Q09, as a result of Roadster component  cost reductions and the timing of costs related to the Daimler   development 
 agreement.  However, cash operating losses expanded sharply as a  result of continued investments in R&D and SG&A headcount and  cash flow 
 from operations fell to -$18 million. 
  
 In July, the company announced an agreement with Toyota to deve                lop an electric powertrain for the RAV4 and expects to begin rec            ognizing 
 development revenues in the 2H10.   The company provided guidance for full year revenues in the range of $100-$115 million.

 Tesla has raised nearly $320 million since 2003 from its CEO, key            development partner Daimler and a group of reputable venture             backers.  
 Additionally, Toyota invested $50 million at  the IPO price in a concurrent private  placement and has announced its intention to  cooperate with 
 the company on the development of EVs.    Prior to December 2009, CEO Elon Musk did no  t receive any compensation for his services  (he 
 currently only accepts $1 in salary) and half of his December 2009 option grant ($24 million fair value) vests based on development milestones for 
 the Model S sedan.  That said, we cannot overlook the fact that   the CEO will split time as he  continues to serve as CEO/Chairma n of Space 
 Exploration Technologies and Chairman of SolarCity.  Several inside           rs sold on the offering and overallotment, including the CEO            and key 
 venture backer VantagePoint; while small on an absolute basis, we find it inappropriate given the early stage of Teslas busine ss.  Finally, only one 
 of eight directors is independent by our standards.

                                                     About Renaissance Capital 
                                                                    
Renaissance Capital LLC (Renaissance Capital or RC), founde d in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991, is the global leader in 
IPO research.  Its clients represent the Whos Who list of t he largest and most active institutional IPO investors.  As an 
independent research provider, Renaissance Capital does not rece  ive payment for research or investment banking services 
from companies under coverage.   
 
In addition to IPO research, Renaissance Capital maintain     s the FTSE Renaissance IPO Composite Index, the definitive 
benchmark of IPO performance and activity, and it manages the IPO Plus Fund, the first mutual fund to focus solely on investing 
in IPOs.  The Fund has a 10 year track record.  FTSE is jointly owned by the Financial Times of London and the London Stock 
Exchange. 
 
Renaissance Capital was established by three Wharton MBA gra duates after they spent over a decade on Wall Street (Merrill 
Lynch, Citi, Bear Stearns, Kidder Peabody   and Credit Suisse First Boston) where they   worked in the areas of investment 
banking, helping young companies raise capital via initial public  offerings, as well as portfolio management, equity research and 
corporate financial restructuring.   
 
Institutional clients have valued Renaissance Capitals IPO research for nearly two decades because of its timely, market savvy 
insights on every US initial public offering and a growing roster  of non-US IPOs.  Renaissance  Capital augments its seasoned 
judgment with a proprietary, expert system for evaluating newly public companies. 
     
                                                                    
                                                       Important Disclosures 
                                                                    
                                                                    
Renaissance Capital Rating Distribution 
 
Renaissance Capitals composite investment ratings fall into three categories:  Outperform (15 to 20), Marketperform (10 to 
14) and Underperform (4 to 9).  These categories are defined as follows: Abov e Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform better than the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months.  Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over   the next 3 months.  Below Average: the subject company is 
expected to perform below the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months. 
 
For purposes of FINRA/N YSE disclosure rules, RCs  Outperform rating most closely corresponds to a buy recommendation; 
RCs Marketperform rating most closely corresponds to a hold/neutral rating; and RCs     Underperform rating most closely 
corresponds to a sell rating.  However Above Average, Average  and Below Average are not the same as buy, hold/neutral and 
sell ratings, as RCs stock ratings are determined on a relative  basis.  An investors decision to buy or sell a stock should 
depend on individual circumstances and risk tolerance.  For the y ear 2009, the distribution of RCs research opinions were as 
follows:  
 
 
                                                                    
                                 Outperform 20% 
                                 Marketperform 74.9% 
                                 Underperform 5.1% 
                                                                    
                                                                    
RC does not have an investment banking operation, and does not have investment banking relationships with any of the companies it 
researches, therefore no distribution of research ratings by investment banking clients are shown above.

Historical Recommendations and Price  
 
The following table details the history of all RC research recommendations on TSLA since its initial public offering.   
 
                                                                   
                                                                  
Firm Certifications  
 
RCs research team is responsible for the rating and recommendat ion expressed herein.  Each member of the research team 
responsible for this report has certified  to RC that the views expressed herein accu rately reflect his or her personal views ab out 
the subject securities and issuer.  Accordingly, RC certif  ies that the recommendation, rating and views expressed herein 
represent the personal views of each member of the research team.  Further, no member of the research team was, is or will be 
paid compensation directly related to the specific recommendation, rating or views expressed herein.   
 
RC is a registered investment   adviser providing portfolio management services  to a diversified mutual fund, the IPO Plus 
Aftermarket Fund (the Fund), which is r egistered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
The Fund may take positions that are contrary to recommendati  ons expressed in a public research report published by RC.  
Also, the Fund may invest to a limited extent in the securities  of public companies that are the subject of a research report 
published by RC.  As a diversified mutual fund, the Fund is limite d to investing no greater than 5% of Fund assets in the share s 
of any one issuer.  As of the date of this report, the Fund does   not beneficially own 1% or more of  the securities of the issue r 
subject to this report.   
 
Members of the research team are compensat ed primarily from firm revenue on the basis of several factors, including quality of 
research, client feedback, stock picking, comp etitive factors and overall revenues of RC  consisting of fees from research and 
money management.  Members of the research team may also rece ive, as one aspect of overall compensation, benefits from a 
compensation program based upon an increase in the net asset value of the Fund. Although members of RCs research team 
(and their households) are prohibited from making direct inve    stments in the securities about   which they report, research 
personnel are permitted to invest in the Fund.  While the Fund       is limited in the amount it can invest in a single stock, 
compensation tied to the Fund or the performance of an investment  in the Fund, could indirectly influence a recommendation or 
rating on such a stock expressed in the report.   
 
In as much as neither RC nor any affiliate has investment banking functions, no research personnel are compensated directly 
or indirectly from investment banking revenue.
