        Price (USD)              28.98Tesla Motors filed an S-1 yesterday, announcing a 5.3MM share public of-
                                      fering and a concurrent private placement to Daimler (644.5k shares) and
        Price target                24.00
                                      CEO Elon Musk (1.5MM shares). Assuming exercise of the 795k share
        52-week range         35.47 - 15.80green-shoe, total proceeds would be $239MM at yesterday's close. On
        Market Cap (USD)         2,907.3current diluted shares of approx 104MM, the offering represents 8% dilu-
                                      tion. TSLA has mentioned the potential for an approximate $100MM raise
        Shares outstanding (m)       100.3
                                      on its last two conference calls, so the offering should not be a surprise.
        Free float (%)             100The inclusion of CEO Musk (current 26% holder) and Daimler (current 7.2%
        Volume (25 May 2011)    1,580,712holder) was unexpected, and we see this as a significant sign of confidence
                                      in the outlook. Our current forecast (prior to this offering) had cash levels

                                      getting relatively low by the time the Model S launches in mid-2012, so we
         
                                      see a proactive offering as a positive from a risk standpoint, as well as po-
