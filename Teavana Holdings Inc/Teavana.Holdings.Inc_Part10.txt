    guidance for 2012 of $208-215 million in revenue on mid-single-digit SSS growth

    earnings  power  due  to  the  Teaopia  acquisition  as  well  as  continued  risk  to

Analyst Certification 
I, Nick Setyan, certify that the views expressed in this report accurately reflect my personal opinion and that I have not and will not, directly or 
indirectly, receive compensation or other payments in connection with my specific recommendations or views contained in this report. 
 
Disclosure information regarding historical ratings and price targets is available at  http://www.wedbush.com/ResearchDisclosure/DisclosureQ112.pdf 
 
Investment Rating System:   
Outperform: Expect the total return of the stock to outperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Neutral: Expect the total return of the stock to perform in-line with the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Underperform: Expect the total return of the stock to underperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) 
coverage universe over the next 6-12 months. 
 
The Investment Ratings are based on the expected performance of a stock (based on anticipated total return to price target) relative to the 
other stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe (or the analyst’s team coverage).*

(as of March 31, 2012)                                               (as of March 31, 2012)

The Distribution of Ratings is required by FINRA rules; however, WS’ stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and Underperform most closely 
conform to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively. Please note, however, the definitions are not the same as WS’ stock ratings are on a relative 
basis.  
 
The  analysts  responsible  for  preparing  research  reports  do  not  receive  compensation  based  on  specific  investment  banking  activity.  The 
analysts receive compensation that is based upon various factors including WS’ total revenues, a portion of which are generated by WS’ 
investment banking activities.
