Investment Thesis 

We are initiating coverage of Tesoro Logist ics LP (TLLP) with an  Outperform rating and     We are initiating coverage of 
price target of $28. TLLP is  a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to      TLLP with an Outperform 
own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. In other words,    Rating 
TLLP was formed to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its logistics infrastructure business. 
Initially, substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under 
various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume 
commitments. Near term, there is visible grow th from already identified projects and future 
drop-downs or asset sales from Tesoro Corp . Longer term, we expect that TLLPs third 
party business will grow both organically and   via acquisitions. Our model assumes that 
TLLP will acquire $200 million of assets from Tesoro Corp. from 2012-2015, enabling the 
MLP to grow its distribution at a five year CAGR of 8.0%. 

TLLPs current valuation does not fully reflec t the partnerships grow th prospects and low 
risk profile, in our view. Hence, we rate the stock Outperform.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and

MLP as it will own about 51% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights.

TLLPs assets are organized into two segments: 

    Crude Oil Gathering  will comprise approximately 48% of projected 2011 EBITDA.           High Plains System 
■
    Revenues from this segment come from TLLPs High Plains system which gathers and   Transports Bakken Oil to 
    transports crude oil from North Dakota and Montana to Tesoros Mandan refinery.          Tesoros Mandan Refinery 
    High Plains is situated within the Bakken s hale; perhaps the most exciting oil play in 
    the US today, and is well positioned for grow th. TLLP will spend approximately $6 to 
    $7 million over the next year to expand its High Plains system to accommodate 
    Tesoros announced 10,000 barrels per day expansion (to 68,000 bpd) of its Mandan 
    refinery. This project is expected to  add about $6 million to TLLPs EBITDA beginning 
    in the second quarter of 2012. In addition,  TLLP is in discussion with third parties 
    regarding expanding its system to gather their crude from the Bakken shale.

■   Terminalling, Transportation and Storage   will comprise approximately 52% of 
    projected 2011 EBITDA. TLLP owns and operates eight refined products terminals 
    that provide distribution primarily for refi ned products produced at Tesoros refineries. 
    Most of the revenues generated in this segment come from transferring refined 
    products from terminals to trucks and barges   . These terminals are located in Los 
    Angeles and Martinez, California; Salt Lak  e City, Utah; Kenai, Alaska; Anacortes, 
    Washington; and Mandan, North Dakota. Growth in this segment will be tied to 
    increases in gasoline consumption, better a  sset utilization, in part by pursuing third 
    party volumes, and pursuing small expansion projects, such as adding ethanol 
    blending capabilities at several terminals.

Bakken Shale 

The Bakken Shale play is one of the premier oil plays in North America today. This 
unconventional play extends from North Dakota and eastern Montana in the United States 
into the Canadian provinces of Saskatchew                         an and Manitoba. TLLPs focus is in the 
Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in Montana and North Dakota, the heart of the play. In 2008, 
the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated t  hat reserves in place could be as high as 
3.65 billion barrels of oil. The Bakken Shale play in North Dakota is currently the most 
actively drilled oil play in the US. Accordi                 ng to the Land Rig Newsletter, the current rig 
count is 128 (all time high was 137 in December 2010).  

Oil production has ramped to 359,589 barrels per day in March 2011, from 137,642 bpd in 
January 2008 according to the North Dakota                           Industrial Commission  (NDIC). TLLP will 
continue to evaluate opportunities to expand                         its High Plains system to accommodate 
increasing crude production from the Bakken Shale.

Valuation 

We derive our price target               of $28 for TLLP through a thr                ee-stage distribution discount 
model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, distribution CAGR of 
8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth 
rate of 1.5%. To arrive at our discount                   rate we use a blended approach combining the 
discount rate implied by the capital asset pric  ing model with the discount rate implied by 
investors assumed required rate of return (y  ield plus expected distribution growth). Our 
$28 price target implies a yield of 5.1%                    in the second quarter of 2012 (12 months out) 
based on a forecast annualized distribution of $1.43 per unit.

         U.S. TSO is the primary sh                                         ipper on TLLPs High Plains system. However, the 
         partnership is evaluating expansion of its sy  stem to access new source of production 
         and make outlet connections to third party pipelines. Importantly, these connections 
         can be made with modest capital requirements.  TLLP is also considering construction 
         of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan refinery to move crude oil in excess of the refinerys 
         needs.

■    Contractual Arrangements with Tesoro Corp Provide Stable Source of Revenue. 
     TLLP has long-term (mostly ten-year comm itments) fee-based contracts with Tesoro 
     that also provide minimum volume commitments and fees that are indexed to inflation. 

■    Potential Dropdowns from Tesoro Provide Visible Growth Opportunities.                         Tesoro 
     still has logistics assets with total aggr  egate book value of $240 million that may be 
     sold to TLLP. This compares to approximately $193.0 million for the initial assets 
     contributed to TLLP.

■    Third Party Business/Acquisitions Another Source for Growth.                     TLLP was formed 
     in part to facilitate the growth of Tesoros  logistics business and to potentially partner 
     with Tesoro in the pursuit of third party   acquisitions. For example, Tesoro and TLLP 
     could jointly bid on a refining  acquisition with the refinery assets acquired by Tesoro 
     and the logistics assets acquired by the MLP. 

■    Financial Flexibility.     TLLP has a strong balance sheet with just $50 million drawn 
     under a $150 million revolving credit facility. For perspective, EBITDA over the next 
     twelve months should approx imate $50 million, so debt to EBITDA is just around 1.0 
     times and well below a target leverage of              under 3.0 times. Also, the distribution 
     coverage ratio is a conservative 1.1 times. 

Challenges/Risks 

■    Tesoro accounts for nearly all of TLLPs revenues and revenues from Tesoros 
     minimum volume commitments are not sufficient to cover the minimum 
     quarterly distribution.     More than 95% of TLLPs next twelve months total revenues is 
     expected to come from Tesoro and approximately 84% of TLLPs revenues are 
     forecasted to be generated from minimum volume commitments from Tesoro. This risk 
     is mitigated by Tesoros strong base of business, financial position and majority (52%) 
     ownership of TLLP. 

■    It is hard to predict the timing of drop-downs and/or third party acquisitions.                   Our 
     model and distribution forecast assumes that TLLP will acquire $200 million of logistics 
     assets from Tesoro over the period of 2012 through 2015. Although we assume $50 
     million of annual drop-downs there is no explicit commitment from Tesoro and TLLP. 
     The timing and amount of drop-downs will impact distribution growth.              

■    Pipeline expansions in the Bakken Shale could displace trucking volumes on 
     the High Plains gathering system.           Overall increases in volumes on the High Plains 
     pipeline system is expected to more than offset potential volume declines in trucking 
     volumes. Additionally, pipeline margins ar  e higher than trucking   volumes primarily 
     because of the lower operating costs.

■   Tesoro, under certain circumstances could suspend, reduce, or terminate its 
    contractual commitments.      These events include the closure or suspension of 
    refining operations by Tesoro or a force ma jeure event that would prevent TLLP from 
    being able to meet its service obligations. 

■   Change in Taxation of Pass-through Entities.         As pass-through entities, MLPs 
    currently pay no tax at the corporate leve l. A corporate tax on MLPs would negatively 
    impact distributable cash flow across the  sector and could negatively impact TLLPs 
    ability to pay distributions. However, we vi ew MLP tax reform as unlikely, as energy 
    MLPs play a crucial role in building and maintaining US infrastructure, which in turn 
    creates U.S. jobs. 

Structure 

Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) comp leted its initial public offering (IPO) of 13 million units at 
$21 per unit in April 2011. To note, the offeri  ng was upsized from 12.5 million units, the 
underwriters over-allotment option was exer cised (1.95 million common units) and pricing 
was at the high end of the $19 to $21 filing r ange. The units were priced to yield 6.4% 
based on the minimum quarterly distribution   of $0.3375. The public owns 48.0% of the 
outstanding equity of TLLP and the balance is owned by Tesoro Corp., including the 
general partner, incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and subordinated common units.  

TLLP has the conventional IDR structure with  the general partner entitled to up to 50% of 
distribution increases if targeted distribution tiers are achieved.

Financials 

Long Term Agreements with Tesoro Provide Cash Flow Stability 

A majority (84%) of TLLPs revenues are expected to come from long-term fee-based 
contracts with Tesoro. These contracts contain minimum volume commitments and fees 
that are indexed to inflation, except for the trucking transportation services agreement. 

High Plains Pipeline  10-Year Pipeline Services Agreement 

TLLP and Tesoro have a ten-year agreement under which Tesoro is obligated to transport 
an average of at least 49,000 bpd of crude oil per month at a committed rate on TLLPs 
High Plains pipeline from North Dakota or             igin points to Tesoros Mandan refinery. 
Committed revenues on this agreement approxim ate $20 million. To note, actual volumes 
transported have historically exceeded this  minimum volume commitment and we expect 
this to be the case moving forward. In addition, the tariff rates will be adjusted annually at 
a rate equal to the percentage change consistent with the FERC indexing methodology. 

High Plains Trucking  Two Year Agreements that Renew Automatically 

Similarly, there is a two-y  ear trucking transportation serv ices agreement in place for a 
minimum of 22,000 bpd per month at a rate of $2.72 per barrel. Committed revenues on 
this agreement approximate $22 million. TLLP  expects to generate incremental revenues 
above the minimum commitment. To note, volumes that are shifted to pipeline gathering 
can reduce the trucking volume minimum obli            gation. However, TLLP realizes a higher 
margin on its pipeline gathering so financial results should not be adversely affected. The 
trucking transportation services agreement w            ill renew automatically for up to four 
successive two-year terms unless earlier terminat ed by TLLP or Tesoro with at least three 
months notice. 

Master Terminalling Services Agreem ent for Refined Products Terminals 
Aggregating 

Under this ten-year agreement, Tesoro is  obligated to an aggregate minimum throughput 
of 100,000 bpd per month at TLLPs eight               refined product terminals. The minimum 
revenue commitment approximates $29 million and fees will escalate annually by a 
percentage equal to the consumer   price index. Additionally, TLLP will charge Tesoro 
separate fees for providing ancillary serv         ices such as ethanol   blending and additive 
injection. Tesoro retains the option to renew the contract for two additional five year terms. 

Short-Haul Pipeline Transportation Services Agreement ~ $5 million Commitment 

Similarly, Tesoro and TLLP have entered into  a ten-year minimum volume commitment on 
TLLPs five Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines. Based on minimum volumes of 54,000 bpd 
and a $0.25 per tariff, the revenue commitment totals $5 million annually. As above, the 
agreement can be renewed for two additional five-year terms and the annual tariff will 
escalate with the percentage change in the consumer price index. 

Salt Lake City Storage Is Fully Contracted 

Tesoro has leased all the capacity (878,000 barrels) at TLLPs Salt Lake City storage 
facility and the existing capacity on the four pipelines connecting to Tesoros Salt Lake City

refinery. The agreed upon tariff of $0.50 per barrel per month may be increased annually 
by the percentage change in the consumer pric e index (at TLLPs option). This agreement 
has an initial term of ten years and may be renewed for two additional five year terms at 
Tesoros option.  

Distribution Outlook 

We forecast a five year distribution CAGR   of 8.0%, driven by $200 million of estimated 
drop-downs ($50 million per year from 2012-15       ). We estimate t  he transactions are 
consummated at an EBITDA multiple of eight times. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 

TLLP has a strong balance sheet  with a $150 million revolving credit facility of which $50 
million has been drawn and paid to Tesoro as     part of the compensation for the assets 
contributed in the formation of the MLP. To note, Tesoro also received $280 million of the 
net proceeds from the IPO and TLLP retained ju st $5 million (primarily for working capital 
purposes and the cost for setting up the revolving credit facility). Capacity under the 
revolver can be increased to $300 million s   ubject to receiving increased commitments 
from the lenders. The loan is guaranteed by a   ll of TLLPs subsidiaries and secured by 
substantially all of TLLPs assets. The borrowing rate approximates a base rate of 3.25% 
plus a margin of about 1.5% or a Eurodolla     r rate (0.21% at April 26, 2011) plus an 
applicable margin of about 2.5%. There is a  0.50% annual commitment fee for the unused 
portion of the revolver. To note, the facility is set to mature on April 25, 2014. 

TLLPs EBITDA over the next twelve mont hs should approximate $53 million, so debt to 
EBITDA is just around 1.0 times and well below a  target leverage of under 3.0 times. Also, 
the distribution coverage ratio is a conservative 1.1 times. 

Capex 

We forecast only $10 million of growth capex in 2011 related to projects to expand 
services at certain terminals and to add c  apacity on its High Plains System. The latter 
relates to the announced expansion of Tesoros Mandan refinery. As noted, the majority of 
TLLPs distribution growth will result from $200 million in drop-down acquisitions. 

Forecast 

We forecast 2011 recurring EBITDA of $50 million, which does not assume any additional 
acquisitions for the year. We assume EBI TDA grows at ~16%  in 2012-13 and 11-12% in 
2014-15, driven by $200 million in   drop-down acquisitions. To note, we think there is 
upside to our numbers, as the market val  ue of potential drop-downs is likely $300+mn. 
There also may be upside to our growth capex  estimate of $10 million if TLLP is able to 
further expand its gathering system around t      he Bakken Shale. Finally, third party 
acquisitions may provide upside to our estimates.  

We forecast three quarters of distributable cash flow (2Q12-4Q12) of $34 million and 
distributable cash flow per LP unit of $1.     10. This compares to our declared LP 
distribution/unit estimate of $1.03, and implie s a 1.07x times coverage ratio. We assume a 
coverage ratio of 1.05-1.12 times throughout our forecast period.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O): The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute total return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the average total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the analyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks a 22% and a 12% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock

Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications,

circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24

Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
*An analysts coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $28 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, 
distribution compounded annual growth rate of 8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth rate of 
1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $28 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destruction and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

This report is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction 
where such distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Credit Suisse AG, the Swiss bank, or its subsidiaries or its affiliates 
(CS) to any registration or licensing requirement within such jurisdiction. All material presented in this report, unless specifically indicated otherwise, is under copyright to CS. None of

The information, tools and material presented in this report are provided to you for information purposes only and are not to be used or considered as an offer or the solicitation of an 
offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report 
constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appropriate to your individual circumstances or otherwise 
constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or completeness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this report. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.
