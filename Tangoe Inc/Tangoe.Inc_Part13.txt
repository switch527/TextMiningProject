                                             Changes to our Estimates

                                             We've  adjusted  our  model  following  TNGO's  acquisition  of  ProfitLine. We  have  increased  our

                                             CY11E revenue forecast by $400K to $104.0 million but left our EPS unchanged at $0.25. For FY12,

                                             we   have   increased   our   revenue   forecast   by   $14.2   million   to   $135.5   million   to   account   for   the

                                             contribution  of  ProfitLine.  Although  we  believe  ProfitLine  will  be  slightly  dilutive  to  TNGO's  gross

                                             margins   in   2012,   we   expect   TNGO   to   achieve   operational   synergies   (elimination   of   redundant

                                             positions) and for the deal to be modestly accretive next year. Thus, we have increased our 2012 EPS

                                             by a penny to $0.40. For a closer view of our other changes, please see the exhibit below:

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $17 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.6x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $124.0M. We note the SaaS
  peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (its
  MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to SaaS architecture by end of
  next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the "stickiness" of its installed
  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,  subscriptions  model),  its  robust  growth  rates  (40%  five-year  CAGR),
  market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with
  its peers, which leads us to our $17 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.
