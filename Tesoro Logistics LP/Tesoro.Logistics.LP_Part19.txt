                                       High-return organic projects should drive double-digit distribution growth 
                                       TLLP has 7 projects totalling $29mm gross or   $20.5mm net (parent will reimburse TTLP 
                                       $8.5mm for Connolly gathering and Salt Lake City/Burley ethanol blending projects) and 
                                       expected to generate incremental EBITDA of $11.5mm, translating to a 1.8x multiple. Of the 
                                       7 projects, 3 are in the emerging Bakken.         The $6mm High Plains expansion will add 
                                       pumping, tankage and truck unloading capaci ty related to TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan, ND 
                                       refinery expansion. Expected EBITDA is $5mm and in-service date is 2Q12. The $1.5mm 
                                       Rangeland interconnect project will connect TLLP’s High Plains pipeline system to 
                                       Rangeland’s North Dakota terminal and pipeline. Expected EBITDA is $1.5mm and in-service 
                                       date is 2Q12. The $4mm Connolly gathering project will build a new gathering expected to 
                                       transport 1,500 bpd of crude. TSO will reimburse TLLP the $4mm cost. The project is 
                                       EBITDA neutral, as it replaces trucked         barrels with piped barrels. However, Connolly 
                                       provides TLLP with a new gathering hub for future expansions. Expected            in-service date is 
                                       1Q12. The remaining projects are terminal expansions in Los Angeles and Stockton, CA and 
                                       ethanol blending in Burley, ID (Salt Lake comple ted in 2Q11) with expected in-service dates 
                                       from 1Q12 to 4Q12.

                                       No update on first dropdown but we expect color at Dec analyst day 
                                       TLLP is in discussions with TSO regarding   the first asset dropdown. However, no further 
                                       color such as size or type of asset was prov  ided during the 11/8 earnings conference call. 
                                       We believe TLLP will provide more detail on it s dropdown schedule at the 12/5 analyst day 
                                       in New York. We forecast TLLP to do a $50mm dropdown in 1Q12.  

                                       Balance sheet update 
                                       At the end of 3Q, TLLP had $100mm of availability on its $150mm revolver. Debt/EBITDA 
                                       was below 1x. Given its low leverage, TLLP will li kely not raise equity for its current slate of 
                                       organic projects and its first dropdown, assuming the drop is below $100mm.

                                          3Q Review 

                                          3Q EBITDA $17.7mm was vs. our $14.2mm estimate and $14.3mm consensus. 
                                          Distributable cash flow was $17.2mm vs. our $12.6mm estimate. Upside to our estimates 
                                          was driven by higher-than-expected crude gathering and terminalling volumes, lower-than-
                                          expected maintenance capex and gain from pr  oduct sale under terminal loss allowance. 
                                          TLLP posted its first distribution bump s          ooner than we forecasted. The Partnership 
                                          increased its quarterly distribution 3.7%          QoQ to $0.35 per unit ($1.40 annualized). 
                                          Distribution coverage was a healthy 1.58x in 3Q. In addition, management slightly increased 
                                          its quarterly EBITDA run rate by $0.5mm to $15.5mm.

Primary Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price) 
Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 08-Nov-2011, USD 26.85), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sector (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s          ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i              n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
