                                               Social Gaming: An Interview With The CEO Of 6waves And The CEO Of
Gaming                                         Lolapps

                                               We  had  a  chance  to  interview  Rex  Ng,  CEO  of  6waves  and  Arjun  Sethi,  CEO  of
                                               Lolapps.  6waves  and  Lolapps  recently  combined  to  make  one  of  the  largest  social
                                               game  developers/publishers  on  Facebook.  The  combined  company  also  received
                                               investment from Nexon and could likely partner with Nexon for publishing and social
                                               commerce. The company is seeing strong growth in social games driven largely by
                                               improving  conversion  rates.  The  company  expects  continued  momentum  in  social
                                               games  driven  by  improving  conversion  and  growing  usage  from  platforms  such  as
                                               Facebook Connect, Google Plus, Tencent, Mixi and mobile.
