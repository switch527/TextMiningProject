Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
