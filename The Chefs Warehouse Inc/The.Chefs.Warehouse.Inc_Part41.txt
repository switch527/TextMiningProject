Company Description: 

The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
United States. The company's core customers are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments, as well as country clubs, hotels, catere        rs, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The 
company distributes more than 11,500 food products, incl uding an extensive selection of distinctive and hard-
to-find specialty items, to over 7,000 customer locations in the United States. 
 
Key Investment Points 
 
We initiated coverage with an Outperform rating on the shares.  We initiated coverage of The Chefs 
Warehouse with an Outperform rating  on the shares, which reflects current valuation, as well as our favorable 
view of the companys competitive positioning within the foodservice distribution industry. We believe that 
CHEF is poised for growth given the companys presence in key culinary markets, combined with its customer 
focus on serving the needs of chefs at independent restau rants and its product focus of sourcing specialty food 
offerings. We also think that the   companys growth potential could be   further enhanced through selective 
acquisition opportunities. 
 
Share valuation. CHEF shares are trading at 14.0x our 2012 EPS  estimate, versus a multiple of 15.8x for the 
peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of  17%. On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading 
at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.5x. Over the next 12 months, we believe that CHEF 
shares warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a mu ltiple of 20-21x our 2012 EPS estimate. In our view, 
key risk factors that could affect share valuation incl      ude the inability to successfu lly integrate acquisitions, 
sales and commodity volatility, challe nges related to sourcing products,   and risks related to the companys 
geographic concentration.

Earnings estimates and longer-term growth outlook. We initiated with a 2011 pro forma EPS estimate 
of $0.76 and a 2012 EPS estimate of $0.97. We think that  The Chefs Warehouse is well positioned to generate 
EPS growth of approximately 17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS growth rate 
is based in part on 7-10% real or organic sales growth, relatively consistent gross margin, and some leverage on 
the operating expense and interest expense lines. We also think that selective acquisitions could further 
enhance the companys long-term growth rate. 
 
Company guidance. Management provided initial gu idance for 2011 with its Q2  results on August 25. The 
company expects 2011 revenue to range from $384 million   to $392 million. The recent acquisition of Harry 
Wils is expected to contribute approximately $10-12 milli       on to revenue in H2 2011, which is incorporated into 
the companys revenue guidance for the year. We also note that Q4 2011 has one extra week in the accounting 
period. On its earnings conference call, management noted that it does not expect to see the rate of inflation, 
which is 4.1% year to date, changing in H2. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be 39%. The 
company is targeting modified pro forma EPS in 2011   of $0.76-0.79 and GAAP EPS of $0.41-0.44. We were 
encouraged by managements commentary during its Q2 earnings conference call in late August that the 
business momentum had continued thus far into Q3 despite recent macro events.  
 
Growth strategies.  The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements: continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities,  further improve operating margin, an d target selective acquisitions. We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings. Management believes that CHEF is the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of its cu stomers and management is focused on maintaining this 
position while working to become the  primary specialty distributor for a larger portion of its customers. We 
also think the company has the opportunity to enhance its distribution network by adding new customers in 
existing markets. In our view, the companys combinat            ion of traditional and spec  ialty product offerings, 
coupled with its ability to cultivate strong customer        relationships, should enable The Chefs Warehouse to

continue to expand the base of customers within existing markets. The organic growth opportunities, if 
successful, should enhance the operating margin by levera ging economies of scale in purchasing, warehousing, 
distribution, and, when combined with fixed cost levera  ge, should result in improv ed profitability. We also 
think opportunities exist within the highly fragmented     foodservice distribution industry for The Chefs 
Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitions that have the potential to expand the breadth of the companys 
distribution network and further enhance operating ef     ficiencies, as well as product offerings and other 
capabilities.  
 
Leading specialty foodservice distri butor in key culinary markets.  We think The Chefs Warehouse 
has cultivated strong relationships  with its customers and suppliers, both of which have enabled the company 
to become a leading specialty foodservice distributor.    CHEFs distribution network targets key culinary 
markets including New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where the company believes 
that it is the largest specialty foodservice distributor (based on net sales). Management believes that these 
markets, along with other markets it serves, includin  g Las Vegas, Miami, Philad elphia, Boston, and Napa 
Valley, often shapes the culinary trends for the United States overall. The company also believes that it 
currently services one or more products to more than  60% of its addressable mark et in the New York metro 
area and to 20-30% of its addressable markets in the other geographies it serves on a weekly basis. 
Management generally defines its addressable or target market as independent restaurants with an average 
entrée price exceeding $15. The company services these markets from an efficient network of seven 
distribution centers, the largest and most profitable  of which is in New York. We also think that CHEFs 
reputation throughout the industry an d established relationships with many  leading chefs, culinary schools, 
and dining outlets has benefited the company as it enters new markets.

Chef-driven customer focus.  The Chefs Warehouse focuses on serving the specific needs of chefs at 
leading independent and fine-dining re staurants, as opposed to chain restaurants. In our view, the company 
has built a strong reputation within the specialty foodse rvice distribution industry through its association with 
well-known independent restaurants, chefs, and culinary sc hools. We think this strate gy helps to differentiate 
the company from many distribution competitors and enables them to fill a rather unique position as a leading 
provider of specialty food products.  We think the team of sales profession als at The Chefs Warehouse is a key 
component of the companys chef-driven customer focu       s. Most sales professionals have received formal 
culinary training, have degrees in culinary arts, and/or  have had experience working in the culinary industry. 
The companys sales force is trained to cultivate relation ships with the chefs, ensure  that their needs are met, 
and educate and collaborate with chefs on broader culinary trends. The Chefs Warehouse services more than 
7,000 customer locations, the majority of which are       independent restaurant lo cations, accounting for 
approximately 66% of the companys annual revenue. We note that the companys customer base represents 
just a small fraction (around 2%) of all U.S. independent restaurants. As of March 31, 2011, there were 
approximately 306,892 independent restaurants in the United States based on ReCount data from The NPD 
Group, Inc., which accounted for approximately 53.5% of total U.S. restaurants.

Low customer and supplier concentration.      Since CHEFs business model targets independent 
restaurants, we think the company may benefit from le ss customer concentration th an traditional foodservice 
distributors, particularly those that service chain rest aurants. During 2010, the  companys top ten customers 
collectively accounted for less than 10% of total net revenue. Likewise, the company also appears to benefit 
from a low level of supplier concentration, with no        single supplier representing more than 5% of 
disbursements. The companys supplier base includes       more than 1,000 different suppliers across North 
America, Europe, Asia, and South America. CHEFs base   of suppliers includes many small and family-run 
businesses for which the company may be the largest customer. Across product categories the company also 
stocks multiple products from multiple suppliers in order to further reduce its reliance on any single supplier.

Extensive portfolio of specialty food products.  We think that The Chefs Warehouse differentiates itself 
within the industry by serving as a premier distributor of  specialty food products both in terms of breadth and 
depth. The company offers a wide range of food products  in its portfolio, which includes basic ingredients such 
as milk, eggs, and flour to more specialty items sourced domestically and through international markets. Some 
of the specialty items that it sources include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars,

hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar, and chocolate. Through its importing division, the company sources 
items from more than 40 countries including Italy,    Spain, France, and other Mediterranean countries. We 
think that the companys ability to  provide its customers with the more exclusive and hard-to-find specialty 
products is a key point of differentiation for The Chef s Warehouse, which also  helps its customers feature 
more distinctive menu offerings. Th e company carries more than 11,500 SKUs in its distribution centers, of 
which 7,000 are generally in stock ev    ery day. In comparison, the aver    age specialty distributor carries 
approximately 1,609 SKUs in its warehouses based on data from the Mintel Group, Ltd. In addition to carrying 
more SKUs than the average specialty distributor, the co mpany also offers greater product selection for certain 
items relative to the large broadline foodservice distributors. The company often emphasizes this point using 
olive oil as an example product. The Chefs Warehouse carries more than 125 different varieties of olive oil 
versus the large broadliners, which typically carry only 5-10 different types of olive oil. In our view, the 
companys ability to offer an extensive selection of high -quality specialty foods, coupled with more traditional 
staple food products, enables The Chefs Warehouse to se rve the varying needs and drop sizes of its customers. 
In addition, management continually works with suppliers and importers to update its product portfolio in 
order to stay current with broader culinary trends.

In addition to offering gourmet brands, The Chefs Warehouse also features proprietary brands, which 
represent about 15% of sales and generate higher margin for the company. The private brands are available for 
certain staple products such as bulk olive oil, Italian grating cheeses, and butter.

Acquisition opportunities coul d enhance growth potential.   We think that the fragmented and 
consolidating foodservice distribution industry presents  The Chefs Warehouse with acquisition opportunities, 
which, over time, may enhance the companys growth potential. During the past several years, management 
has pursued and completed tuck-in and new market acquis itions, which have enabled its business to grow at a 
faster clip than it would have been able to on a stand-alone, organic basis. Management believes that it has 
enhanced the operations and profitability of the compan  ies it has acquired, in part  by leveraging sourcing 
capabilities to offer customers an expanded portfolio of products, implementing more effective sales force 
strategies, and installing enhanced technology systems.  We note that the $200 billion foodservice distribution 
market (the United States and Cana da) is comprised of more than 16,5  00 distributors, according to Sysco 
Corporation (per its December 2010 Investor presentation). The market includes 3,000 distributors with 
revenue of $10-400 million, and anothe  r 13,000 distributors with sales of   less than $10 million annually. 
While not all of these distributors may fit Chefs acquisit ion profile, we think the number is still representative 
of the ample consolidation opportunities within the industry. In our view, the management team of The Chefs 
Warehouse has taken a prudent and selective approach to its acquisition strategy, which we view favorably.

Based on managements commentary, it appears that Chicago may be one potentially attractive new market to 
enter as part of its longer-term acquisition strategy. Ma nagement believes that the  Chicago market offers the 
most similarity with the New York metro area in terms   of customer concentration, which we think allows for 
more efficient customer drops from a distribution and  routing perspective. Other potential new markets could 
include Atlanta, Texas, Denver, and Phoenix.  
 
Recently completed Harry Wils acquisition.   On June 24, 2011, the company completed the tuck-in 
acquisition of Harry Wils & Co. through the purchase of  inventory and certain intangible assets, including the 
companys customer list. The purchase price the company paid for Harry Wils & Co. was approximately  
$7.7 million (for the intangible asse ts), and $1.2 million for the inventor y. Immediately following the close of 
the transaction, the company relocated the purchased inve  ntory to its distribution facility in New York. The 
acquisition was financed with borro wings under the companys revolving credit agreement. On the companys 
Q2 earnings call in late August,       management commented that it has            not seen much customer attrition 
following the acquisition, and that the business  had been tracking very close to managements expectations.

Distribution platform.  Currently, the companys distribution network consists of seven distribution 
centers, a list of which follows, and a truck fleet that  fills an average of 11,000 or ders per week. The company 
provides service six days per week to customers in many markets and leases its truck fleet from both national 
and regional leasing firms. Products are generally delivere d to the companys distribution facilities by its truck 
fleet, contract carriers, or directly from the supplier. Customer orders come in throughout the day via phone, 
email, or fax, and are sent to the shipping department. The orders are input into computer programs, which 
send pick tickets to the warehouse. Warehouse employees then drive around the facility picking the necessary 
items and placing the products on pallets, which are then loaded onto the trucks based on a pre-determined

delivery sequence. The company utilizes routing and logi stics planning software, which helps to maximize the 
number of daily deliveries from each facility, and also   enables the company to make those deliveries within 
each customers preferred time window. In the companys New York facilities, drivers arrive at the warehouse 
around 3-4am to pick up the customer invoices before departing in the loaded trucks to begin making 
customers deliveries.

Most of the trucks and trailers used for delivery fe   ature separate temperature- controlled compartments for 
products varying refrigeration needs. The companys truck fleet is monitored using GPS and vehicle 
monitoring systems to continually assess the trucks conditions and also analyze driver performance. One of 
the companys main goals is to efficiently fill and delive r a customers order, typically within 12-24 hours from 
the time of order placement.

Technology initiatives should  improve operating efficiencies.  Over the past few years, The Chefs 
Warehouse has made si gnificant investments in dist ribution, sales, information, and warehouse management 
systems. The companys warehouse management system  has been implemented in CH EFs main distribution 
facility in New York, and the company expects to integrat e the system into the rest of its distribution network 
by the end of 2011. The system provides real-time inventory tracking across the distribution center, as well as 
metrics on inventory turns. The company has also begun  to roll out pick-to-voice technology for its warehouse 
employees in the distribution facilities, as well as truc k builder, which have the potential to enhance order fill 
rates and accuracy. Management  believes that the investments it has ma de in its current systems are scalable 
and can support the companys future growth.  
 
Strong real sales growth.  One of the metrics used to better analyze top-line performance is real sales 
growth, which strips out revenue cont ributions from acquisitions and adju sts for inflation or deflation, and 
other factors, like mix, resulting in a more clear pictur e of the core growth of the business. The following chart

Attractive margin profile.   While the distribution industry (food          service and grocery wholesaling) is 
generally characterized as being a low-margin business,       we think The Chefs Warehouse is positioned to 
achieve more attractive margins given its competitiv       e positioning. We attribute the companys distinct 
competitive position in large part to its customer focu s on independent restaurants, combined with its product 
focus on specialty food offerings.  On a trailing-12-month basis, gross ma rgin for The Chefs Warehouse was 
26.2%, versus 18.6% for Sysco, and  18.2% for United Natural Foods. The  operating margin was 6.7% for The 
Chefs Warehouse, versus 5.0% for Sysco, and 2.9% for United Natural Foods on the same basis.

Recently reported quarterly results.  On August 25, The Chefs Warehouse reported Q2 modified pro 
forma net income of $4.2 million and modified pro form a EPS of $0.20. The results reflected revenue growth 
of 18.7%, to $99.3 million, versus $83.6 million last year. The revenue growth was driven by increased case 
volume and increased revenue  per case. The sales increase also includ  ed $1.7 million of net sales (or a 2% 
benefit to sales growth) for the Flor  ida operations the company acquired  in June 2010. Adjusting for the 
acquisition contribution, internal sales growth was 16.7 %. Inflation and mix contributed 3.3% to sales growth. 
The drivers of the food cost inflation were mainly dairy,  oils, and seafood. Adjusting for inflation and mix, the 
company posted strong real or organic sales growth of  13.4% in the quarter. The gr oss profit margin increased 
50 bps year over year, to 26.5% of revenue. Management attributed most of the basis-point expansion to 
higher margins on the sale of protein offerings, driven by customer and product mix shift. Operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales improved 60 bps year over year , reflecting leverage on higher sales. On a GAAP basis, 
the company reported EPS of $0.17, versus $0.13 in the prior-year period.

Cash flow and capital expenditure.  The company is targeting capital spending in the $1.0-2.0 million 
range for 2011 and the $7.5-9.0 million range for 2012. Management anticipates funding these expected needs 
with cash from operations and borrowings under its revo  lving credit facility. For 2011, the capital spending 
range includes costs related to additional square footage for the Miami operations buildout in Q3. The 
significant ramp-up in projected capital spending for 20 12 primarily relates to managements plans for a new 
and expanded distribution facility project in New York.  We are targeting for the company to generate positive 
free cash flow of $16.1 million and $13.7 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

underwriters to cover overallotments. The company received approximately $63.1 million in net proceeds from 
the sale of primary shares in the o  ffering (after underwriting fees an d commissions, and estimated offering 
expenses). Management planned to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness. Following the IPO, The Chefs 
Warehouse entered into a new senior credit facility, wh ich includes a $30 million term loan and a $50 million 
revolving credit facility, both maturi ng in 2015. At the end of Q1 2011, the companys total debt on an as-
adjusted basis for the offering, use of proceeds, new credit facilities, and Harry Wils acquisition  
was $46.2 million.  
 
 
Company History 
 
The company was founded in 1985 as Dairyland USA Corporation. At that time, the company was primarily a 
distributor of butter and eggs, as well as some specialty  food products to chefs in the New York metropolitan 
area. From 1985 to 2000, the compan y focused on becoming a leading spec ialty food distributor in the New 
York market by offering high levels of customer serv      ice and providing a differentiated product portfolio. Since 
1999, the company has entered five new markets, th             e first of which was Washington, D.C., through a 
Greenfield development. In 2005, the acquisition of Van Rex Gourmet Foods gave the company a presence in 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las  Vegas. The companys most recent ne w market entry was Miami in 2010, 
with the acquisition of the assets of Monique & Me, Inc.  During its 26-year history, The Chefs Warehouse has 
grown to become a leading distributor of specialty food pr oducts, with a presence in six of the nations leading 
culinary markets. By focusing on specialty food prod         ucts and serving the specific needs of chefs at many 
leading independent restaurants, we think customers have come to rely on The Chefs Warehouse as an 
ingredients company or a virtual pantry.

Potential Risk Factors 
 
Consumer spending trends.  Since the companys target customers  are restaurants and other foodservice 
establishments, its business is exposed to changes in general economic environment and levels of consumer 
spending. During periods of economic slowdown or   weak consumer spending, restaurants may experience 
weaker sales trends and consumers may choose to spend fewer dollars on discretionary purchases such as food 
away from home. To the extent that sales for the restaurants the companys serves are affected by reductions in 
customer frequency and spending, this can hurt the comp anys business as its fixed co sts are then spread over 
a lower volume of sales. If the current challenging economic environment continues for an extended period of 
time, then consumers may make longer-term changes to their spending patterns, which could affect the 
companys business.  
 
Commodity cost pressures, prod uct sourcing, and labor costs.  The company is, in part, dependent 
on commodities and the ability to respond to changes in food costs, availability, and potential interruptions in 
its distribution network. The company sources a large    portion of its specialty food products from local, 
regional, national, and international third-party suppliers . Typically the company neither participates in long-
term contracts with its suppliers, nor uses financial inst ruments to hedge its risk exposure to fluctuations in 
the price of certain food products. Seve ral factors can affect food costs and availability including weather, crop 
conditions, government regulation, changes in fuel costs,  natural disasters, food-borne illnesses, seasonality of 
items, transportation costs, and other challenges that may be beyond the companys control. If management is 
unable to react to food cost fluctuations through its sourcing and purchasing practices, or identify alternative 
sources of supply or similar product to meet custom     ers needs, then the companys business could be 
negatively affected by cost increases and/or the loss of   a customer. The results of operations could also be 
negatively affected by potential changes in customer perc eption of the quality or selection of its products. In 
addition, labor cost fluctuations, such as the increases seen with minimum wage  rate hikes and potential 
changes in labor legislation could also affect the companys results. 
 
Margin and margin sensitivity.  While The Chefs Warehouse generates profit margins that are generally 
higher than that of a traditional broadline foodservice di  stributor, it may still be considered low relative to 
other industries. Most of the companys sales are at prices that are based on a product cost plus a percentage 
markup. Thus, food cost volatility can have a direct im  pact on the companys profit ability. During extended 
periods of product cost inflation, profit margins for The Chefs Warehouse may be negatively affected to the 

 
                                                                                                                                11 
                                                                                                                                  381

                                                                                         WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC 
Restaurants & Foodservice                                                             EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 
 
extent the company is unable to pass along some or all  of the cost increases to cu stomers. Conversely, during 
deflationary cost periods, profit levels can be negatively affected even if the companys gross profit (as a % of 
sales) remains constant an d the company may need to reduce expens  es to compensate for the lower gross 
margin. Therefore, managements inability to respond to  cost pressures (both infl ationary and deflationary) 
and respond accordingly could have a negative impact on its business or results of operation.  
 
Potential growth of group purchasing organization.   Management has noted that it has felt some 
pricing pressure from group purchasing organizations, which are targeting smaller, independent restaurants in 
an effort to offer them lower prices for products by  aggregating their purchasing power. To the extent that 
these organizations are successful in attracting a signif icant number of the compan ys customers as members, 
then management may be forced to lower prices or risk losing business. In addition, some of the companys 
customers, including the majority of its hotel customer s, purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse 
through group purchasing organizations. 
 
Geographic concentration. The companys foodservice distribution operations are concentrated in six key 
culinary markets, making The Chefs Warehouse susceptible to changes in economic conditions and other 
developments or events, such as adverse weather conditions within these markets. Their highest concentration 
of sales is in the New York market, which accounted    for 66% of net revenue in 2010, making the company 
particularly exposed to potential chan ges in this regional economy. A chan ge in the economic conditions or 
disruption in any of these key culinary markets, especi ally New York, could have a material adverse impact on 
CHEFs financial results. In addition, the companys   operations and distribution centers in New York and 
Washington, D.C. are at risk for adverse winter weather   such as snow and ice, whil e Miami is susceptible to 
hurricanes, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are at ri sk for earthquakes and mudslides. While management 
has disaster recovery plans in the event of a temporary closure or destruction of the companys distribution 
facilities, there can be no guarantee that such an event would not significantly affect the results of operations.

Consumer health concerns, eating habits, and government regulation.    As a distributor of food 
products, The Chefs Warehouse is susceptible to negative publicity or news regarding food-quality issues, 
public health concerns, illness, and safety. While mana  gement has taken steps to help mitigate such risks, 
there can be no guarantee that these types of public-driven health concerns can not be entirely eliminated, and 
therefore, a potential incident could  damage the companys repu tation and hurt the results of operation. We 
also think that consumer preferences and eating habits   can be affected by changes in health, diet, and food 
regulations, which could lead to additional costs for the   company if it is required to alter or discontinue the 
sales of certain items in its portfolio. Consumer preferences can also be affected by negative publicity regarding 
beef and chicken consumption, particularly as it relates to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also 
known as mad cow disease, and avian influenza, also known as bird flu. In addition, a widespread outbreak of a 
contagious disease or even the threat of a widespread ou tbreak could have a significant negative effect on the 
companys customers and the restaurant  industry overall. In su ch a scenario, we think that restaurant traffic 
may not only suffer from the potentia lly large number of individuals who are sick, but also by a potentially

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

even greater number of otherwise healthy consumers who choose to stay home and avoid public places for fear 
of being infected themselves. The companys business is also highly regulated at the federal level by the Food & 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and also at the state and local 
level. Potential increases in  regulation and compliance-related cost s could negatively affect the companys 
supplier base, as well as the company. 
 
Product liability claims.  The Chefs Warehouse is also at risk of ex posure to product liability claims if any 
products it sells cause injury or illn ess. While the company has liability in surance, it may not be adequate to 
cover potential claims whether actual or alleged, or  the insurance might not continue to be available at a 
reasonable cost, or at all. Therefore, product liabilit  y claims, product recall costs, and related matters could 
have a material negative impact on the companys business if it does not have enough insurance or contractual 
indemnification from the manufacturer. 
 
Customer retention and payments.  In general, the companys restaurant customers are not required to 
continue to purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse since the company does not typically engage 
in long-term contracts with its cust  omers. Thus, there can be no assura  nce that the volume or number of 
customer orders will not change. A si  gnificant decrease in the volume or  number of purchase orders from 
existing customers, as well as managements inability to attract new business, could have a material negative 
impact on the business. In addition, the company may experience losses in the event that its customers file for 
bankruptcy or are unable to make their payments in a timely manner, which could hamper the ability to collect 
their accounts receivable. This could  require management to ta ke larger provisions for bad debt expense. The 
challenging economic environment may also place greater  financial strain on smaller companies, like many of 
the companys restaurant and fine dining customers, wh ich could negatively affect CHEFs results. However, 
we point out that the companys business is not re     liant on any one customer, as its top ten customers 
collectively account for less than 10% of net revenue, thus limiting CHEFs customer concentration. 
 
Increases in fuel costs.  As a distributor, The Chefs Warehouse is exposed to increases in fuel costs, which 
can have a negative impact on its business. As the price of diesel fuel rises, it can not only increase the price the 
company pays for a product from its supplier, but also      the cost incurred to distribute that product to 
customers. Thus, increases in fuel co sts can have a negative impact on ne t sales, margins, operating expenses, 
and results. During periods of increa sed fuel cost, management has typically been able to pass along at least a 
portion of the higher cost to customers, but there can be no guarantee the company will be able to continue to 
implement fuel surcharges when necessary. Management has indicated that fuel expenses generally represent 
about 70 bps of operating costs.

Competition.  The foodservice distribution industry is highly fragmented. The company competes with 
smaller distributors on a local and regional level, as well as against a few large national broadline distributors 
such as Sysco and U.S. Foodservice wi th much greater purchasing power. The companys success is somewhat 
dependent on its ability to meet its customers needs for specialty products and ingredients, as well as its desire 
for high service levels and timely de livery of products, among other factor s. There can be no assurance that 
competitors may not seek to provide specialty products and services that are similar to or better than the 
companys. The Chefs Warehouse may face increased competition, which could lead to price reductions, lower 
gross margin, and a loss of market share, which could have a material negative impact on the business.

Managing future growth. The companys ability to manage its future growth, whether through acquisitions 
or organically, is another factor that could affect the business and results of operations. If The Chefs 
Warehouse reaches near maximum capacity at a particular  distribution facility, the operations of that location 
may be constrained, which could lead to inefficiencies  unless the facility is expanded or volume is shifted 
elsewhere. Likewise, if management were to expand an existing facility or bring on additional facilities, the 
excess capacity could lead to inefficiencies. There can be no guarantee that the company will be able to 
implement the necessary systems (operational, financial,  and technology related)  to manage and support its 
employees and the future growth of the business. In addition, any damage to existing computer systems or the 
network infrastructure could cause an operational disr  uption, which could have a   negative impact on the 
business or results of operation. 
 
Acquisition integration.  A substantial portion of the companys growth has been achieved through 
acquisitions of other specialty food products distri butors. Managements ability to successfully integrate 
acquired companies in the future is  an important factor in determining th e growth potential of the company. 
The Chefs Warehouse expects to expand its presence in existing markets through fold-in acquisitions and also 
enter new markets through new-market acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that management 
will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisit  ion targets, consummate acquisitions, and integrate the 
acquired entities into the company. The successful inte gration of an acquired company has many facets, some 
of which include maintaining the existing customer base, optimizing delivery routes, managing the back-office 
functions, and integrating the techno logy and personnel systems. The inte gration process has the potential to 
distract managements attention, an d any challenges encounte red with the transition process could have a 
negative impact on the companys business, particular  ly in periods immediately following the closing of a 
transaction. In addition, the companys ability to co  mplete acquisitions in th  e future may hinge upon 
management obtaining the necessary financing, which can not be guaranteed. 
 
Dependence on senior management. The companys success is somewhat dependent on the expertise of 
its senior management team, many of whom have extensive experience in the foodservice distribution industry 
and/or with the company. The loss of services of one or  more members of this senior management team or key 
personnel could have a material negative effect on the companys business operations. 
 
Potential sale of restricted shares.  There are about 11.7 million shares of restricted CHEF stock held by 
founders and executive officers, which accounts for about 56% of diluted shares outstanding. The potential sale 
of these shares, which are restricted from resale for 180 days following the IPO, could have a material impact 
on the companys stock price. 
 
Financial leverage. The company has a substantial amount of inde btedness. On an as adjusted basis for the 
offering and use of proceeds and entry into its new credit facilities as of March 25, 2011, CHEF has 
approximately $37.2 million in total  debt, including $30 million outstandin g under its new term loan facility 
and $7.2 million outstanding under its new revolving credit facility. Includ ing the Harry Wils acquisition, the 
company has total debt outstanding of $46.2 million      , which incorporates an additional $8.9 million 
outstanding under the revolving credit  facility, bringing the total outstand ing under the revolver to slightly 
more than $16 million. A dramatic decline in sales or adverse developments in the credit markets could have a 
significant and detrimental impact on the companys abil ity to meet the terms of its debt obligations, which 
could have a material nega  tive effect on the companys business and financial condition. Based on the 
companys new credit facilities, management has noted that a 100-basis-point increase in market interest rates 
would lower after-tax earnings by approximately $300,000, assuming other variables remain constant.  
 
Foodservice Distribution Industry Overview 
 
The foodservice distribution industry is a large and extremely fragmented industry, which serves the 
restaurant sector. There are two primar y types of foodservice distributors: broadline distributors and specialty 
distributors. The following table lists the top ten broadline foodservice distribution companies, according to ID 
Report. Sysco Corporation, U.S.  Foodservice and Performance Food Grou p are the three largest broadline

Customer base.  There are two principal types of restaurant cu  stomers that foodservice distributors serve: 
traditional independent operators and  multi-unit chain operators. Tradit ional operators include independent 
restaurants, hotels, cafeterias, schools, healthcare facilities, and other institutional operators. Multi-unit chain 
customers are operators of regional             and national quick-service, casual dining, and fine dining restaurant 
chains. Many broadline distributors service both customer segments, while others focus more on one customer 
type. Foodservice distributors generally  refer to their traditional independ ent restaurant customers as street 
accounts and multi-unit customers as  chain accounts. Following are some of the key differences between 
street and chain accounts, and how they are serviced.   
 
•    Street accounts. These are typically characterized by more freque nt and smaller deliveries of products 
     to independents restaurant operators in close proxim                  ity to a distribution facility. A companys street 
     business normally has to inventory a much larger numb er of products (SKUs) th an the chain operations. 
     Street accounts are very competitive since one customer may be serviced by multiple distributors versus 
     having one dominant supplier in the chain business.  Customer relationships can be very important in the 
     street business, due to the competitive nature of the supplier base.  
      
•    Chain accounts.  These are generally characterized by less frequent, higher-volume deliveries of a 
     narrow range of products. These products are tailored to meet the needs of a whole chain of restaurants in 
     a broad geographic area. Chain accounts require a high level of customer service since they rely on one 
     distributor for nearly all of their food products. Distri butors with chain operations often have large trucks 
     dedicated to servicing large,  long-distance deliveries to chain acco  unts. As a result, deliveries to chain 
     accounts are normally more efficient than street accounts and lead to lower operating expenses as a 
     percentage of sales, which offsets lower gross margins for chain accounts.

Sales drivers. Foodservice distributors employ a variety of methods to drive sales, including existing account 
penetration, the addition of new customer accounts, and external growth from acquisitions. While sales growth 
is mostly driven by changes in volume, it can also be affected by changes in commodity prices from inflation 
and deflation. For instance, periods of  inflation may increase the dollar value of the companys sales. Likewise 
periods of deflation may lower the dolla r value of sales, while the unit sale s may remain the same or actually 
increase. Some companies will break out the componen        ts of their sales growth including inflation and 
acquisitions to provide a clearer picture of the organic growth of the business. 
 
•   Existing account penetration.  By increasing sales to existing cust omers, distributors can internally 
    drive sales growth and operating margin improvements by leveraging fixed costs. One way distributors 
    penetrate existing accounts is through the introduc    tion of new product categories. Distributors also 
    generate sales growth from existing   relationships by capitalizing on    the unit growth of multi-unit 
    customers.   
 
•   New customer accounts.   One of the main ways distributors co           ntinue to drive their sales is by 
    establishing new customer accounts. Companies ofte      n increase their sales force as they obtain new 
    customers to enhance the level of service.  
 
•   External growth.  There are two main types of acquisition st       rategies distributors use to externally 
    expand their operations: tuck-in and new market. In ge     neral, a tuck-in or fold-in strategy is used to 
    describe the acquisition of competing distributors with  in existing areas of oper ations or in contiguous 
    regions. These companies may have  complementary customer bases or  product offerings. With a new 
    market acquisition, a distributor is seeking to expand  operations to a new and attractive geographic area 
    and leverage the strengths of the combined companies to improve market share and profitability.  
 
Profitability drivers. Several factors can affect the profitability of  distributor sales, in cluding delivery size, 
delivery frequency, customer mix, product mix, and information systems.  
 
•   Delivery size.  In general, the larger the delivery size, the more profitable the account is since the 
    majority of delivery expenses are fixed. When a delivery size is increased, the fixed costs are then spread 
    over a larger size order and the profitability is improved.       
 
•   Delivery frequency.  The timing of delivery varies for each customer since it largely depends upon a 
    restaurants inventory base, storage, and refrigeration capacity, and product freshness requirements. In 
    general, fewer, larger size deliveries result in im  proved truck utilization and lower operating expenses. 
    While decreasing the frequency of each delivery increases the profit per drop, the distributors are limited 
    in their ability to control this factor.   
 
•   Customer mix.  There are two main customer segments that foodservice distributors principally serve: 
    traditional independent op erators and multi-unit chains. The traditional independent operators are 
    typically referred to as street accounts, while multi- unit chains are called chain accounts. Chain accounts 
    generally rely on one distribution company for the      majority of their purchasing needs. While chain 
    accounts can lead to higher volume, they also result   in lower gross margins for the distributors. Higher 
    gross margins can be derived from the street accounts since independent operators do not have the 
    purchasing strength of the larger chains restaurants.  Thus, street accounts are generally more profitable 
    on a gross margin basis.      
 
•   Product mix.  Distributors divide their product offerings   into two principal categories: private label 
    brands and regional and national brands. Private label products serve as an alternative to the normally 
    higher-priced regional and national brands of comparable quality. Higher gross margins are generated 
    from proprietary label products, and therefore, it is more profitable for  distribution companies to increase 
    private label sales as a percentage of overall product mix.  
 
•   Information systems.  The sophistication of a distributors management information system can also 
    affect a companys margins. A more advanced system can lead to improved margins by enabling a 
    company to operate more efficiently with lower internal costs.

Restaurant Industry Overview 
 
Linked to the restaurant industry. By providing food and food-related products to a variety of restaurant-
type establishments, foodservice distributor revenue is tied to food away from home sales growth trends.  
 
Our overall restaurant sector outlook for 2011 has been   cautious, as we remain concerned about consumer 
spending pressures tied to high unemployment and bloated consumer debt levels. We believe that consumer 
spending pressures will continue to weigh on restaurant        traffic trends until we see a significant shift in 
consumer confidence (which may not happen until the employment situation shows further improvement). 
The unemployment rate peaked at 10% in Q4 2009 and is forecasted to remain at more than 9% in 2011-13, 
according to the September 2011 forecast by Wells Fargos Economics Group.

From a segment perspective, we think the casual-dining segment could be the most heavily exposed restaurant 
category to consumer spending headwinds over the ne  xt year. In our view, restaurant supply and demand 
dynamics, while improving, may contin ue to weigh on a potential recovery   for the segment. Casual dining 
concepts may continue to fight for market share from   each other until demand prospects improve. We think 
the quick-service restaurant (QSR) segment may be better  positioned to benefit from some trade-down given 
the relatively lower menu price points . We also think that significant impr ovements to food quality and menu 
breadth over the past few years has increased consumer relevance of the QSR sector and expanded the 
customer demographic. International expansion opportunities also represent an attractive growth vehicle for 
many of the leading QSR chains. While some economic he  adwinds continue to persist, the fine dining group 
could be positioned to benefit if business-related spendi  ng remains fairly resilient.  Some fine-dining chains 
derive a majority of their sales from business-related travel and corporate spending.  
 
Restaurant Industry Sales Forecasts 
 
Based on the latest forecast (as of May 2011) from Te chnomic Information Services, total restaurant sales are 
forecasted to increase 2.6% in 2011 on a nominal basi s (versus 2.3% from  the January 2011 forecast). For the 
restaurant industry overall, we are encouraged by Technomic, Inc.s forecast for continued sales growth in 2011 
on a nominal basis, though it is below historical tr    end levels for both the limited-service and full-service 
restaurant segments. The 2011 forecast reflects slightly  positive nominal sales growth of 3.5% for the limited-
service segment (up from 2.5% previously) and 1.5% growth for the full-service segment (down from 2.0% 
previously). Adjusting for Technomic s assumed inflation rate of 2.5%, th      e real growth forecast is 1% for

Restaurant Demand Trends  
 
CREST survey data from The NPD Grou  p shows that restaurant traffic tr ends have softened, suggesting the 
environment remains challenging. Overall restaurant tra ffic trends weakened sequentially and turned slightly 
negative for the three months ended June 2011, as shown  in the following graph. The return to negative traffic 
reflects more weakness in the full-service segment, while the quick-service segment has held steadier.

More favorable view of restau  rant sector pricing power relative to grocery stores.     We have 
greater confidence in restaurant sector pricing power relative to grocery stores in the current environment, 
based in part on recent inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate of inflation for food at home 
has been steadily rising and is tracking higher than the       rate of inflation for food away from home, as shown in 
the following graph. Given this trend,  we think restaurant companies may be better positioned to pass along 
menu price increases to consumers as they compete against grocery stores for consumers food dollars. The 
CPI for food at home is forecasted to  increase 3.5-4.5% in 2011, versus a 3.0-4.0% expected increase for food 
away from home based on the July 2011 forecast from the USDAs Economic Research Service. As part of our 
demand analysis, in our restaurant  supply and demand outlook we are us ing inflation assumptions of 3.0% 
and 2.5% for food away from home for 2011 and 2012, respectively.

In our view, restaurant companies with the ability to           take some menu pricing       while still maintaining a 
compelling price/value offering should  be best positioned to compete in 2011. Most restaurant companies we 
cover have taken some menu pricing th         is year to help cover at least a portion of the impact from rising 
commodity pressures. Overa ll, the approach to pricing appears to be conservative as companies remain 
focused on balancing price/value in a prolonged weak consumer spending environment.  
 
Commodity Cost Environment 
 
We expect commodity inflation for the restaurant sector to  continue this year, but at a moderated pace relative 
to 2010. The American Restaurant Association (ARA) is forecasting an indexed commodity cost increase of 6% 
on a full-year basis in 2011, which would come on to          p of a 14% increase in 2010. For 2012, the ARA is 
forecasting indexed commodity costs to  increase 2% on a full-year basis            following two years of significant 
inflation.

conditions, which the ARA believes may affect the outlook into 2013, as well. The increased forecast versus last

projections for corn and soybean crop yields due to poor growing conditions. This is expected to lead to record-
high feed costs over the next 12 mo nths, meaning commodity production growth will likely be limited in 2012. 
Drought conditions in Texas  and nearby states have forced producers to bring cattle to market earlier given 
challenging pasture conditions and feed supplies, which  will likely limit 2012 supplies and beef output. If the 
drought conditions do not improve, the ARA expects winter wheat plantings this fall to be reduced. 
 
The following table shows wholesale inflation and deflation by major restaurant commodity item. For 2011, 
chicken is forecasted to be down, while most other categories are expected to be up, including beef, cheese, 
potatoes, grains, and eggs.

About The Restaurant Commodity Index.    The Restaurant Commodity In  dex is comprised of eight 
subindices based on restaurant type and their menu mix across key food categories ranging from ground beef 
and chicken breasts to cheese, french fries, pasta, and produce. The eight restaurant types include casual 
dining, fast casual, fast food, Italian, mexican, pizza, steakhouse, and wing restaurants. The indices are based 
on spot commodity market inflation and do not includ                    e any contracting assumptions. The index is updated 
monthly by the American Restaurant Association. 
 
 
Restaurant Supply And Demand 
 
The number of U.S. restaurants contracted 1.6% yr/yr,   or by 9,450 units, according to Spring 2011 ReCount 
data from the research firm The               NPD Group. We attribute the unit                contraction to the prolonged weak 
consumer spending environment and high unemployment   rate, which have contribu ted to sales and traffic 
challenges for the restaurant sector and to store closures, with the decline coming more from independents.

The NPD Group compiles unit count data for restaurants twice per year. The spring data, as of March 31, 2011, 
show that the number of independent restaurants declin ed 2.7% yr/yr, while the number of chain restaurants 
declined 0.3%. Relative to trends from  spring 2010 and fall 2010, the spring 2011 data reflect a greater degree 
of contraction for independents, as well as a shift to contraction for chains.  
 
We view the directional move in the spring data as an   overall positive for the industry, as further contraction 
should help strengthen the supply and demand balance. We could see the overall supply and demand balance 
moving further into positive territory by the end of 20  11, assuming continued contraction in the supply base 
and a pickup in demand.

Supply And Demand By Segment 
 
We have broken down our main restaurant industry su pply and demand graph to provide a better picture of 
restaurant segment trends. The following graphs illust rate supply and demand tren ds for the full-service and 
quick-service restaurant segments, with the latter showing a healthier supply and demand balance. 
  
Full-service supply and demand.  In 2011, we think the supply and demand balance for the full-service 
segment has the potential to come into balance and turn   positive in 2012; however, this hinges on continued 
contraction in supply and improvement in demand.

Quick-service supply and demand.  We see demand continuing to exceed supply for the limited-service 
segment in 2011 and 2012, reflecting a continuation of sl  ightly positive real sales growth trends and a slight 
contraction in the supply base for 2011, followed by flat supply growth in 2012.

For purposes of our supply and demand analysis, restaura  nt demand refers to the year-over-year growth in 
real restaurant sales (nominal sales adjusted for food       away from home inflation), while restaurant supply 
refers to the year-over-year unit growth for restaurants. The spread or balance refers to the difference between 
the demand and supply growth, with a positive numb          er being favorable (demand exceeding supply) and a 
negative number being less favorable   and indicating a period of oversuppl  y, or imbalance. The restaurant 
industry supply data are based upon a September fiscal year-end, with a midyear update as of March each year.

Supply Trends -- Chains Versus Independents 
 
While the operating environment remains challenging fo       r chains and independents, chains appear to be 
managing through it better than independents, with the  growth in the supply of chain restaurants declining a 
slight 0.3% and the supply of independents declining 2.7% as of the Spring 2011. As illustrated in the following 
figures, supply trends for chain restaurants have outpaced independent restaurants, which have contracted for 
eight out of the past ten years. We have seen a gradua  l pullback in overall chain su pply over the past several 
years, with growth slowing to turning slightly negative as of the Spring 2011 from 3.5% in 2005.

Chain advantages over independents.    In our view, chain restaurant              s possess several competitive 
advantages relative to their independent counterparts that serve to benefit chains over the long term. We think 
that these advantages can be seen through greater purchasing power, stronger employee programs, easier 
access to capital allowing for the purchase of prime real estate and unit expansion, and advertising efficiencies. 
We also think that casual dining chains may be bett     er positioned to enhance consumer relevance through 
product and service innovation. In our  view, on a combined basis, these fact ors can make it more difficult for 
independent restaurants to successfully compete against  the larger chains, adding support to our outlook for 
continued contraction of the independent restaurant base  in the United States. That being stated, independent 
restaurants still account for the majority of restaurants in  the United States, with a market share of 53% as of 
spring 2011. However, as shown, the market share for independent restaurants has gradually decreased from 
60% in 2002, which we expect to continue over the long term. 
                                                          
Methodology. Our supply and demand analysis   is supported by data that we compiled from Technomic 
Information Services, The NPD Group, Inc. ReCount data, government statistics, and Wells Fargos Economics 
Group. Technomic is a consulting firm providing research and forecasts on the restaurant industry, mostly on a 
fee basis. ReCount is a census of commercial restaurant  s in the United States, prov iding unit count data for 
more than 570,000 restaurants, incl uding both independent and chain op  erators on a fee basis. ReCount

obtains information on unit location from both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include direct 
input from chain headquarters, Internet directories, and telephone contact for confirmation and reconciliation. 
Secondary sources include financial reports, commercial mailing lists, government information, and telephone 
directories. ReCount categorizes rest aurants by service type and food sp ecialty within the quick-service and 
full-service restaurant segments. We no te that the unclassified category  within the full-service segment is a 
default category for units that are not  categorized as casual dining, family dining, or fine dining. Nearly all of 
the units in the unclassified segment are independents, the majority of which are also low-volume operators.  
 
ReCount releases two updates annually showing restaurant  unit counts as of the end of March and September. 
The Spring 2011 release is based on restaurants open as  of March 31, 2011, and includes restated data for the 
prior-year periods. We note that starting with ReCounts Fall 1998 release, the total number of units being 
reported is about 4-5% higher than figures reported   through ReCount in prior releases, due to a complete 
refurbishing of the database to increase coverage of the U.S. Restaurant market.
