Company Description: 

The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
U.S. The company's core customer           s are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments as well as country clubs, hotels, cate        rers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The 
company distributes more than 11,500 food products, incl uding an extensive selection of distinctive and hard-
to-find specialty items, to over 7,000 customer locations in the U.S. 
 
Key Investment Points 
 
Initiating coverage with an Outperform rating.    We are initiating coverage of The Chefs Warehouse 
with an Outperform rating, which reflects current valu  ation as well as our favorable view of the companys 
competitive positioning within the foodservice distributi  on industry.  We believe that CHEF is poised for 
growth given the companys presence in key culinary markets combined with their customer focus on serving 
the needs of chefs at independent restaurants and their pr oduct focus of sourcing specialty food offerings.  We 
also think that the companys growth potential coul           d be further enhanced thro  ugh selective acquisition 
opportunities. 
 
Share valuation.  CHEF shares are trading at 14.0x our 2012 EPS estimate versus a multiple of 15.8x for the 
peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of  17%. On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading 
at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.5x. Over the next twelve months, we believe that CHEF 
shares may warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a multiple of 20-21x our 2012 EPS estimate. In our 
view, key risk factors that could        affect share valuation include the inability to successfully integrate 
acquisitions, sales and commodity volati lity, challenges related to sourcing  products, and risks related to their 
geographic concentration.

Earnings estimates and longer term growth outlook.  We are initiating a 2011 pro forma EPS estimate 
of $0.76 and a 2012 EPS estimate of $0.97.   We think that The Chefs Warehouse is well-positioned to 
generate EPS growth of approximately 17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS 
growth rate is based in part on 7-10% real or organi        c sales growth, relatively co nsistent gross margins, and 
some leverage on the operating expense and interest expense lines.  We also think that selective acquisitions 
could further enhance the companys long-term growth rate. 
 
Company guidance.  Management provided initial guidance for 2011 with their Q2 results on August 25th.  
The company expects 2011 revenue to range from $384-392  million.  The recent acquisition of Harry Wils is 
expected to contribute approximately $10-12 million to   revenue in H2 2011 which is incorporated into the 
companys revenue guidance for the year.  We also note that Q4 2011 has one extra week in the accounting 
period. On the earnings conference call management noted they do not expect to see the rate of inflation, 
which is 4.1% year to date, changing in the back half of the year.  The effective tax rate for the year is expected 
to be 39%.  The company is targeting modified pro forma EPS in 2011 of $0.76-0.79 and GAAP EPS of $0.41-
0.44.   
 
Growth strategies.   The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements:  continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities, further improve operating margins and target selective acquisitions.  We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings.  Management believes they are the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of thei r customers and management  is focused on maintaining 
this position while working to become the primary specialt y distributor for a larger portion of their customers.  
We also think the company has the opportunity to               enhance their distribution network by adding new 
customers in existing markets.  We   think the companys combination of   traditional and specialty product 
offerings coupled with their ability to cultivate strong customer relationships should enable The Chefs 
Warehouse to continue to expand their customer base within existing markets.  The organic growth 
opportunities, if successful, should enhance the oper          ating margin by leveraging   economies of scale in

purchasing, warehousing, distribution and when combined with fixed cost leverage should result in improved 
profitability.  We also think opportunities exist within  the highly fragmented foodservice distribution industry 
for The Chefs Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitio ns which have the potential to expand the breadth of 
the companys distribution network, and further enhance operating efficiencies as well as product offerings 
and other capabilities.   
 
Leading specialty foodservice distributor in key culinary markets.   We think The Chefs Warehouse 
has cultivated strong relationship with their customer s and suppliers both of which have enabled the company 
to become a leading specialty foodse   rvice distributor.  CHEFs distribution network targets key culinary 
markets including New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles, where the company believes 
they are the largest specialty foodservice distributor (based on net sales).  Management believes that these 
markets along with other markets they serve includin    g Las Vegas, Miami, Philad elphia, Boston and Napa 
Valley often shape the culinary trends for the U.S. overall.  The company also believes they currently service 
one or more products to over 60% of their addressable market in the New York metro area and to 20-30% of 
their addressable markets in the other geographies they serve on a weekly basis. Management generally defines 
their addressable or target market as independent restaurants with an average entrée price of over $15.  The 
company services these markets from an efficient network of seven distribution centers, the largest and most 
profitable of which is in New York.  We also think     that CHEFs reputation throughout the industry and 
established relationships with many leading chefs, cu   linary schools and dining outlets has benefited the 
company as they enter new markets.

Chef-driven customer focus.    The Chefs Warehouse focuses on serving the specific needs of chefs at 
leading independent and fine-dining restaurants as opposed to chain restaurants.  In our view, the company 
has built a strong reputation within the specialty food  service distribution industry through their association 
with well known independent restaurants, chefs and culi     nary schools.  We think this strategy helps to 
differentiate the company from many   distribution competitors and enab  les them to fill a rather unique 
position as a leading provider of sp  ecialty food products.  We think the   team of sales professionals at The 
Chefs Warehouse is a key component of their chef-driven customer focus.  The majority of sales professionals 
have received formal culinary training, have degrees in culinary arts and/or have had experience working in 
the culinary industry.   The companys sales force is tr  ained to cultivate relationsh ips with the chefs, ensure 
their needs are met and educate/collaborate with chefs on broader culinary trends.  The Chefs Warehouse 
services over 7,000 customer locations, the majority of which are independent restaurant locations accounting 
for approximately 66% of the companys annual revenue.  We note that their customer base represents just a 
small fraction (around 2%) of all     U.S. independent restaurants.  As of March 31, 2011, there were 
approximately 306,892 independent restaurants in the U.S. based on ReCount data from The NPD Group, Inc. 
which accounted for approximately 53.5% of total U.S. restaurants.

Low customer & supplier concentration.       Since the CHEF business model targets independent 
restaurants we think the company may benefit from less  customer concentration than traditional foodservice 
distributors, particularly those that service chain rest aurants.  During 2010, the companys top 10 customers 
collectively accounted for less than 10% of total net re  venue.  Likewise the company also appears to benefit 
from a low level of supplier concentration with no single supplier representing more than 5% of disbursements.  
The supplier base includes  over 1,000 different suppliers across     North America, Europe, Asia and South 
America.  Their base of suppliers includes many small and family run businesses for which the company may 
be the largest customer.       
 
Extensive portfolio of specialty food products.  We think that The Chefs Warehouse differentiates itself 
within the industry by serving as a premier distributor of  specialty food products both in terms of breadth and 
depth.  The company offers a wide range of food produc  ts in their portfolio which includes basic ingredients 
such as milk, eggs and flour to more specialty items so urced domestically and throug h international markets.   
Some of the specialty items they source include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, 
hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar and chocolate. We think that the companys ability to provide their 
customers with the more exclusive and hard to find spec ialty products is a key point of differentiation for The 
Chefs Warehouse, which also helps their customers feature more distinctive menu offerings.  The company 
carries over 11,500 SKUs in their dist  ribution centers, of which 7,000 are   generally in-stock every day.  In 
comparison, the average specialty distributor carries approximately 1,609 SKUs in their warehouses based on 
data from the Mintel Group, Ltd.  In addition to carrying more SKUs than the average specialty distributor the 
company also offers greater product selection for certain items relative to the large broadline distributors.  The 
company often emphasizes this point using olive oil as an example.  The Chefs Warehouse carries more than 
125 different varieties of olive oil versus the large broadl iners which typically carry only 5-10 different types of 
olive oil.  In our view the companys ability to offer   an extensive selection of high quality specialty foods 
coupled with more traditional staple food products enables The Chefs Warehouse to serve the varying needs 
and drop sizes of their customers.   Additionally, management continually  works with suppliers and importers 
to update their product portfolio in order to stay current with broader culinary trends.

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

 
Acquisition opportunities could  enhance growth potential.    We think that the fragmented and 
consolidating foodservice distribution industry presents  The Chefs Warehouse with acquisition opportunities 
which over time may enhance the comp anys growth potential. During the past several years management has 
pursued and completed tuck-i n and new market acquisitions which have  enabled their business to grow at a 
faster clip than they would have been able to on a stand-alone organic basis.   Management believes they have 
enhanced the operations and profitability of the companies they have acquired in part by leveraging CHEFs 
sourcing capabilities to offer customers an expanded po rtfolio of products, implemen ting more effective sales 
force strategies, and installing enhanced technology    systems.  We note that the $200 billion foodservice 
distribution market (U.S. and Canada  ) is comprised of more than 16,500 distributors according to Sysco 
Corporation (per their December 2010  Investor presentation).  The mark et includes 3,000 distributors with 
revenues of $10-400 million and anot her 13,000 distributors with sales of  less than $10 million annually.  
While not all of these distributors may fit Chefs acquisit ion profile, we think the number is still representative 
of the ample consolidation opportunities within the industry.  In our view the management team of The Chefs 
Warehouse has taken a prudent and selective approach to their acquisition strategy which we view favorably.

Based on managements commentary, it appears that Chicago may be one potentially attractive new market to 
enter as part of their longer-term acquisition strategy.   Management believes that the Chicago market offers 
the most similarity with the New York metro area in   terms of customer concentration which we think allows 
for more efficient customer drops from a distribution and routing perspective.   
 
Recently completed Harry Wils acquisition.    On June 24, 2011, the company completed the tuck-in 
acquisition of Harry Wils & Co. through the purchase of  inventory and certain intang ible assets including the 
companys customer list.  The purcha se price the company paid for Harry Wils & Co. was approximately $7.7 
million (for the intangible assets)  and $1.2 million for the inventory.   Immediately following the close of the 
transaction, the company relocated  the purchased inventory to their di stribution facility in New York.   The 
acquisition was financed with borrowings under the companys revolving credit agreement.   
 
Technology initiatives should im prove operating efficiencies.   Over the past few years The Chefs 
Warehouse has made significant inve stments in distribution, sales, in formation and warehouse management 
systems.  The companys warehouse management system   has been implemented in their main distribution 
facility in New York and the company expects to integrate the system into the rest of their distribution network 
by the end of 2011.  The system provides real-time inventory tracking across the distribution center as well as 
metrics on inventory turns. The company has also be       gun to roll out pick-to-voice technology for their 
warehouse employees in the distribution facilities as well as truck builder which have the potential to enhance 
order fill rates and accuracy.  Management believes th   at the investments they have made in their current 
systems are scalable and can support the companys future growth.   
 
Strong real sales growth.    One of the metrics used to better analyze topline performance is real sales 
growth which strips out revenue contributions from acqu isitions and adjusts for inflation/deflation and other 
factors like mix resulting in a more clear picture of the  core growth of the business.  The following chart shows 
the real or organic sales growth for  The Chefs Warehouse over the past several quarters which has outpaced 
that of Sysco, the largest broadline foodservice distributor in the U.S.  The Chefs Warehouse has achieved real

Attractive margin profile. While the distribution industry is generally characterized as being a low margin 
business, we think The Chefs Warehouse is position       ed to achieve more attractive margins given their 
competitive positioning.  We attribute the companys di      stinct competitive position in large part to their 
customer focus on independent restaurants combined with their product focus on specialty food offerings.  On 
a trailing twelve month basis gross margin for The Chefs Warehouse was 26.2% versus 18.6% for Sysco and 
18.2% for United Natural Foods.  The  operating margin was 6.7% for The  Chefs Warehouse versus 5.0% for 
Sysco and 2.9% for United Natural Foods on the same basis.

Recently reported qu arterly results.   On August 25, The Chefs Warehouse reported Q2 modified pro 
forma net income of $4.2 million and modified pro form a EPS of $0.20.  The results reflected revenue growth 
of 18.7% to $99.3 million versus $83.6 million last year.  The revenue growth was driven by increased case 
volume and increased revenue  per case.  The sales increase also includ  ed $1.7 million of net sales (or a 2% 
benefit to sales growth) for the Flor  ida operations the company acquired   in June 2010.  Adjusting for the 
acquisition contribution, internal sales growth was 16.7%.  Inflation and mix contributed 3.3% to sales growth.  
Adjusting for inflation and mix, the company posted st      rong real or organic sales growth of 13.4% in the 
quarter.  The gross profit margin increased 50 bps year over year to 26.5% of revenue.  On a GAAP basis, the 
company reported EPS of $0.17 versus $0.13 in the prior year period. 
 
Initial public offering (IPO) and use of proceeds.  On August 2, 2011, The Chefs Warehouse announced 
the completion of its IPO of 10,350,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share.  The company offered 4.7 
million shares and selling shareholde    rs offered 5.7 million shares, incl  uding 1.4 million shares sold to 
underwriters to cover over-allotments.  The company received approximately $63.1 million in net proceeds

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

from the sale of primary shares in the offering    (after underwriting fees an d commissions and estimated 
offering expenses).  Management planned to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness.  Following the IPO, 
The Chefs Warehouse entered into a new senior credit facility which includes a $30 million term loan and a 
$50 million revolving credit facility, both maturing in 2015.   At the end of Q1 2011, the companys total debt on 
an as adjusted basis for the offering, use of proceeds, new credit facilities and Harry Wils acquisition was $46.2 
million.   
 
 
Potential Risk Factors 
 
Consumer spending trends.  Since the companys target customer s are restaurants and other foodservice 
establishments, their business is exposed to changes in general economic environment and levels of consumer 
spending. During periods of economic slowdown or       weak consumer spending, restaurants may experience 
weaker sales trends and consumers may choose to spend fewer dollars on discretionary purchases such as food 
away from home.  To the extent that sales for the rest aurants the companys serves are impacted by reductions 
in customer frequency and spending, this can negatively  impact the companys business as their fixed costs are 
then spread over a lower volume of sales.  If the current challenging economic environment continues for an 
extended period of time then consumers may make lo       nger term changes to thei r spending patterns which 
could impact the companys business.   
 
Commodity cost pressures, product sourcing and labor costs.   The company is in part dependent on 
commodities and the ability to respond to changes in f  ood costs, availability, and potential interruptions in 
their distribution network.  The comp any sources a large portion of their sp ecialty food products from local, 
regional, national and international third-party suppliers.   Typically the company does not participate in long-
term contracts with their suppliers nor does the co    mpany use financial instrume nts to hedge their risk 
exposure to fluctuations in the price of certain food   products.  Several factors   can impact food costs and 
availability including weather, crop conditions, government regulation, changes in fuel costs, natural disasters, 
food-borne illnesses, seasonality of  items, transportation costs and other  challenges which may be beyond the 
companys control.  If management is unable to react to food cost fluctuations through their sourcing and 
purchasing practices or identify alternative sources of supply or similar product to meet customers needs then 
the companys business could be negatively impacted by   cost increases and/or the loss of a customer.  The  
results of operations could also be negatively impacted by potential changes in customer perception of the 
quality or selection of their products.  In addition, labor cost fluctuations such as the increases seen with 
minimum wage rate hikes and potential changes in labor legislation could also impact the companys results. 
 
Margins & margin sensitivity.   While The Chefs Warehouse generates profit margins that are generally 
higher than that of a traditional broadline foodservice distributor they may still be considered low relative to 
other industries.  Most of the companys sales are at prices which are based on a product cost plus a percentage 
markup.  Thus, food cost volatility ca n have a direct impact on the companys profitability.   During extended 
periods of product cost inflation, profit margins for Th e Chefs Warehouse may be negatively impacted to the 
extent the company is unable to pass along some or all of  the cost increases to cust omers.  Conversely, during 
deflationary cost periods, profit levels can be negatively impacted even if their gross profit (as a % of sales) 
remains constant and the comp any may need to reduce expenses to compensate for the lower gross margins.  
Therefore, managements inability to respond to cost      pressures (both inflationa ry and deflationary) and 
respond accordingly could have a negative impact on their business or results of operation.   
 
Potential growth of group purchasing organization.      Management has noted th ey have felt some 
pricing pressure from group purchasing organizations which are targeting smaller, independent restaurants in 
an effort to offer them lower prices for products by a  ggregating their purchasing power.  To the extent that 
these organizations are successful in attracting a signif icant number of the compan ys customers as members, 
then management may be forced to lower prices or risk losing business.  Additionally, some of the companys 
customers, including the majority of their hotel cu     stomers, purchase their pr  oducts from The Chefs 
Warehouse through group purchasing organizations. 
 
Geographic concentration.  The companys foodservice distribution operations are concentrated in six key 
culinary markets making The Chefs Warehouse susceptible to changes in economic conditions and other 
developments or events such as adverse weather conditions within these markets.  Their highest concentration 
of sales is in the New York market which accounted     for 66% of net revenues in 2010 making the company 
particularly exposed to potential changes in this region al economy.  A change in the economic conditions or 
disruption in any of these key culinary markets, especi ally New York, could have a material adverse impact on 
CHEFs financial results.  Additionally the companys   operations and distribution  centers in New York and 
Washington D.C. are at risk for adverse winter weather   such as snow and ice, whil e Miami is susceptible to 
hurricanes, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are at ri sk for earthquakes and mudslides.  While management

Consumer health concerns, eating ha bits and government regulation.   As a distributor of food 
products, The Chefs Warehouse is susceptible to negati    ve publicity or news regarding food quality issues, 
public health concerns, illness, and safety.  While ma  nagement has taken steps to  help mitigate such risks 
there can be no guarantee that these types of public driven health concerns can not be entirely eliminated and 
therefore a potential incident could damage the companys  reputation and impact the results of operation.  We 
also think that consumer preferences and eating habits   can be affected by changes in health, diet and food 
regulations which could lead to additional costs for the company if they are required to alter or discontinue the 
sales of certain items in their portfolio.  Consumer preferences can also be impacted by negative publicity 
regarding beef and chicken consumption,  particularly as it relates to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also 
known as BSE or mad cow disease) and avian influenza (also known as bird flu).  Additionally, a widespread 
outbreak of a contagious disease or even the threat of  a widespread outbreak could have a significant negative 
effect on the companys customers and the restaurant in     dustry overall.  In such a scenario, we think that 
restaurant traffic may not only suffer from the potentially large number of individuals who are sick but also by 
a potentially even greater number of otherwise healthy consumers who choose to stay home and avoid public 
places for fear of being infected themselves.  The companys business is also highly regulated at the federal 
level by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and also at the 
state and local level. Potential increases in regulation and compliance related costs could negatively impact the 
companys supplier base as well as the company. 
 
Product liability claims.   The Chefs Warehouse is also at risk of exposure to product liability claims if any 
products they sell cause injury or illness.  While the company has liability insurance it may not be adequate to 
cover potential claims whether actual or alleged nor may the insurance continue to be available at a reasonable 
cost or at all.   Therefore, product liability claims, product recall costs and re  lated matters could have a 
material negative impact of the companys business if it does not have enough insurance or contractual 
indemnification from the manufacturer. 
 
Customer retention and payments.   In general the companys restaurant  customers are not required to 
continue to purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse since the company does not typically engage 
in long-term contracts with their customers.  Thus, there can be no assurance that the volume or number of 
customer orders will not change.  A si  gnificant decrease in the volume or  number of purchase orders from 
existing customers as well as managements inability to   attract new business could have a material negative 
impact on the business.   Additionally the company may experience losses in the event their customers file for 
bankruptcy or are unable to make their payments in a  timely manner which could impact the ability to collect 
their accounts receivable.  This could require management to take larger provisions for bad debt expense.  The 
challenging economic environment may also place greater financial strain on smaller companies like many of 
the companys restaurant and fine dining customers whic h could negatively affect CHEFs results.  However, 
we point out that the companys business is not reli    ant on any one customer as their top ten customers 
collectively account for less than 10% of net revenue thus limiting their customer concentration. 
 
Increases in fuel costs.   As a distributor, The Chefs Warehouse is exposed to increases in fuel costs which 
can have a negative impact of their business.  As the price of diesel fuel rises it can increase the price the

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                           EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

company not only pays for a product from their supplier but also the cost incurred to distribute that product to 
customers.  Thus increases in fuel co sts can have a negative impact on ne t sales, margins, operating expenses 
and results.  During periods of increased fuel cost mana gement has typically been able to pass along at least a 
portion of the higher cost to customers but there can be no guarantee the company will be able to continue to 
do so when necessary.   
 
Competition.  The foodservice distribution industry is highly fragmented.  The company competes with 
smaller distributors on a local and regional level as well as against a few large national broadline distributors 
such as Sysco and U.S. Foodservice with much greater purchasing power.  The companys success is somewhat 
dependent on their ability to meet their customers ne  eds for specialty products and ingredients, as well as 
their desire for high service levels, and timely delivery of products among other factors.  There can be no 
assurance that competitors may not seek to provide specialty products and services which are similar to or 
better than the company.  The Chefs Warehouse may fa  ce increased competition which could lead to price 
reductions, lower gross margins and a loss of market share which could have a material negative impact on the 
business.   
 
Managing future growth.     The companys ability to manage th          eir future growth, whether through 
acquisitions or organically, is anothe r factor that could impact the busine ss and results of operations.  If The 
Chefs Warehouse reaches near maximum capacity at a particular distribution facility the operations of that 
location may be constrained which could lead to inefficien cies unless the facility is expanded or if volume is 
shifted elsewhere.  Likewise if management were to expand an existing facility or bring on additional facilities, 
the excess capacity could lead to inefficiencies.   There can be no guarantee that the company will be able to 
implement the necessary systems (operational, financial  and technology related) to  manage and support their 
employees and the future growth of the business.  Additionally, any damage to existing computer systems or 
the network infrastructure could cause an operational di sruption which could have  a negative impact on the 
business or results of operation. 
 
Acquisition integration.   A substantial portion of the company       s growth has been achieved through 
acquisitions of other specialty food products distri butors. Managements ability to successfully integrate 
acquired companies in the future is  an important factor in determining th e growth potential of the company.  
The Chefs Warehouse expects to expand their presence in existing markets through fold-in acquisitions and 
also enter new markets through new-market acquisitions.  However, there can be no assurance that 
management will be able to successfully identify suitab  le acquisition targets, consummate acquisitions and 
integrate the acquired entities into the company.   The successful integration of an acquired company has many 
facets some of which include maintaining the existing customer base, optimizing delivery routes, managing the 
back office functions and integrating the technology an d personnel systems.  The integration process has the 
potential to distract managements attention and any ch allenges encountered with the transition process could 
have a negative impact on the companys business partic ularly in periods immediately following the closing of 
a transaction.  Additionally the companys ability to  complete acquisitions in the future may hinge upon 
management obtaining the necessary financing which can not be guaranteed. 
 
Dependence on senior management. The companys success is somewhat dependent on the expertise of 
its senior management team, many of whom have extensive experience in the foodservice distribution industry 
and/or with the company. The loss of services of one or  more members of this senior management team or key 
personnel could have a material negative effect on the companys business operations. 
 
Potential sale of restricted shares.  There are about 11.7 million shares of restricted CHEF stock held by 
founders and executive officers which accounts for about 56% of diluted shares outstanding. The potential sale 
of these shares, which are restricted from resale for 180 days following the IPO, could have a material impact 
on the companys stock price. 
 
Financial leverage. The company has a substantial amount of indebtedness.   On an as adjusted basis for the 
offering and use of proceeds and entry into their ne    w credit facilities as of March 25, 2011, CHEF has 
approximately $37.2 million in total debt including $30 million outstanding under their new term loan facility 
and $7.2 million outstanding under th eir new revolving credit facility.   Including the Harry Wils acquisition 
the company has total debt outstanding of $46.2 milli    on, which incorporates an additional $8.9 million 
outstanding under the revolving credit  facility bringing the total outstandin g under the revolver to just over 
$16 million.  A dramatic decline in sales or adverse developments in the credit markets could have a significant 
and detrimental impact on the companys ability meet   the terms of its debt obligations which could have a 
material negative effect on the companys business and financial condition.
