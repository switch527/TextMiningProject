    Teaopia’s  average  s ales  volumes  of  $435K  (<1/2x  Teavana’s  $913K  avg.)  can 
    increase over time, we believe that margins in the near- to medium-term will be                            Teavana Holdings, based in Atlanta, GA, 
    pressured.  We are not including Teaopia in our model, pending the transaction’s                           owns and operates >200 retailers of ~100 
    close in Q2 (exception of $0.01 impact i n Q1:12).  If included, the impact would be                       varieties of loose-leaf tea, a selection of 
    a further -$0.03-0.04 in 2012E and +$0.02-0.03 in 2013E. (Page 10)                                         fresh-brewed      teas,      and      tea-related 
  •  Our $21 price target is based on a 26x multiple on our 2013 EPS estimate .                                merchandise. 
    This multiple is in line with TEA’s peer group.  Based on our expec tation of risk to                       
    consensus   expectations   and   the   execution   risks   accompanying   the   Teaopia                     
    acquisition, we do not believe a premium is appropriate, despite TEA’s higher 2013 
    EPS growth rate relative to peers.  (Page 11)

Investment Thesis 

We believe Best-in-Class ROI Justifies Industry-Leading Unit Growth    

We believe Teavana can sustain its industry-leading unit growth rate, given its 75% year-1 cash-on-cash return, which is the highest 
within our restaurants universe, including beverage peers (Figures 1-2), through 2015. Importantly, management has been able to 
sustain this level of cash-on-cash returns even as a greater mix of newer units open in Tier-2 malls, and achieve lower expected sales 
levels of $600-700K than the current system average of ~$900K.   
Much  of  the  debate  has  centered  on  what  Teavana’s  opportunity  is,  beyond  500  stores  in  2015  (from  200  currently),  and  an 
examination  of  the  many  hypothetical  opportunities,  both  unit  growth  and  other  (CPG,  licensing,  international,  etc.)  have  been 
exhausted.  While we believe Canada adds upside to the 500 unit target, particularly given the pending Teaopia acquisition, we believe 
a footprint beyond 500 units in the U.S. would not support current economics given the ceiling on locations that can support the 
company’s sales productivity (Figure 3).   
Nevertheless, we would note that even if there were no unit growth or other opportunities beyond 500 units in 2015, we believe the 
company’s mature-level cash flow would be enough to repurchase ~11-13% of shares outstanding per year at the current share price, 
resulting in double-digit EPS growth in 2016, even with relatively conservative assumptions regarding revenue and margins (Figure 4).

Believe Focus on Comps ex. eCommerce to be Misplaced, but Likely to Continue  

We believe that as a Teavana unit matures, characteristics specific to the concept could result in muted average check and transaction 
growth  within  the  store.    Therefore,  unlike  a  typical  growth  concept,  we  believe  that  SSS  growth,  excluding  e-Commerce,  is 
inappropriate as a measure of the concept’s ongoing success, and look to SSS growth, including eCommerce, as the appropriate 
measure.  Nevertheless, we believe that continued focus on in-store SSS metrics is likely in the near- term.    

We illustrate what we believe is the risk to in-store comparable sales metrics as a unit matures (Figure 5).  We believe that average 
check pressure occurs as a returning visitor no longer needs to purchase accompanying merchandise, and traffic pressure results from 
migrations to online purchases over time.

to Online Ordering Over Time

 1  Transaction – Large in-Store Avg. Ticket :  3 2oz. tea samples ($4.40-
 25.00 per 4oz.) + tea kettle for loose leaf tea ($19.99) 
  
  nd
 2  Transaction – Smaller In-Store Average Ticket :  Larger size of the 
 preferred tea through either a return visit to the store or purchase online.    
  
  rd
 3    Transaction   –   Similar   Average   Ticket,   but   Migration   to   Online :  
 Increased  probability  of  purchase  online  without  a  return  visit  to  the 
 store.

Transactions and Average Check  

Historically, transactions have remained flat to down, with average check growth being the main driver of SSS growth, ex. eCommerce, 
(Figures 6-7).  While declining beverage sales as a mix of total sales has contributed to the decline in transactions and the growth in 
average size, in recent years, the beverage mix has stabilized at 4% of sales (Figure 8).  We also estimate this impact as no more than 
9 bps of improvement in average check per 10 bp decline in the mix of beverage sales (Figure 9).

The most significant contributor to increased average ticket has been a higher price paid per unit and a higher number of units per 
transaction (Figure 10).  The company does not typically increase menu prices, and we believe the impact of a higher number of units 
per  transaction  is  offset  by  a  decline  in the number of  transactions over  time.    Therefore,  we  believe  the  sole sustainable comp 
contributor is the company’s ability to drive a higher price per unit by consistently driving customers to trade up to higher-priced teas.   
We believe the marginal impact of this driver diminishes as a unit matures, with an increasing mix of units in their second year or older 
starting in 2012 (Figures 11-12).  Combined with the impact of a higher proportion of sales that we believe migrate online as a store 
matures and enters the comp base (Figure 13), we are not surprised that management’s 2012 guidance of “mid-single-digit” SSS 
growth, including eCommerce, implies a deceleration in ex-eCommerce SSS growth to the low-single-digits from 5.5% in 2011 and 
8.7% in 2010.

Expectations    
Given 2012 revenue guidance of $208-215 million, on SSS growth including eCommerce of “mid-single digits”, we believe downside to 
Street  revenue  expectations  (prior  to  the  Teaopia  acquisition  announcement  last  week)  of  $215.2  million  exists.      We  estimate 
eCommerce revenue in 2011 was $12.8 million, and expect 37% growth in 2012 to $17.6 million (Figure 14).  Our analysis indicates 
that eCommerce growth will contribute 4.2% to 2012 SSS growth, with a 2.1% contribution from in-store SSS growth (Figure 15).  We 
believe the higher Street expectations relative to management guidance and our expectation is the result of more aggressive in-store 
(ex. eCommerce) SSS growth expectations.

operating margin expansion in 2013 to 19.8% (Figures 16-17).  With the company’s direct sourcing move fully anniversaried in 2011, 
we expect any gross margin benefit to come from the natural maturation process of stores, as higher-margin tea sales increase relative 
to merchandise sales.  Nevertheless, we believe the benefit from this maturation process over time may currently be overblown.  With a 
new store’s tea sales mix growing to 60% of sales from 50% at opening, and tea gross margins ~10% above non-tea gross margins, a 
store’s gross margins expand no more than 1% (Figure 18).  In 2012, we believe this impact will be somewhat diminished by the 
reacceleration in new unit growth that took place in 2010, as the mix of mature units dips slightly (Figure 19).  Combined with higher 
growth of lower-gross-margin eCommerce sales, we are modeling only a 20 bp increase in gross margins in 2012, accelerating to 50 
bps in 2013 as the impact of immature units begins to decrease (Figure 20).  We expect SG&A costs to pressure operating margins by 
30 bps in 2012 as the first half of 2012 is impacted 200-300 bps from public company costs not present in 1H:11, deleverage that is 
mostly recouped in 2H:12 (Figures 21-22).  Our 2012 EPS expectation, excluding the impact of Teaopia, is $0.60, below the pre-
acquisition consensus of $0.62.  Management guidance is $0.58-0.61.

Believe Pending Teaopia Acquisition Adds New Layer of Uncertainty, Given Expected Adverse Impact on Margins in Near-to-
Medium Term    

While the pending Teaopia acquisition answers some strategic questions and we believe Teavana can benefit from lifting Teaopia’s 
average unit volumes over time, the only certainty accompanying the acquisition is that near- to mid-term margins will be pressured.  
Although management provided no details on the acquisition call regarding Teaopia’s margins, given that average Teaopia sales per 
store of $435K are less than half of Teavana’s average of $913K, that loose-leaf tea as a % of revenue of ~50% is less than Teavana’s 
55%, and that absolute dollar occupancy costs are at 100% of Teavana occupancy costs, we believe both gross and operating margins 
are meaningfully lower.   
Additionally, while we believe management’s ability in lifting Teaopia’s sales levels is aided by the fact that Teaopia is essentially a 
copycat operation, down to the POS system used (Figures 23-24), management did state that it plans to increase labor expense ahead 
of sales growth, which we believe could impact 2013’s expected $0.03-0.04 of accretion should the expected sales lift come in below 
expectations.  Excluding transaction costs of $0.04-0.05, mostly in Q1-Q3, management expects the acquisition to have no impact on 
2012 EPS.  We are not including the ~$16 million in annual revenues, or any EPS impact, in our model pending the acquisition’s close 
in Q2.  We are, however, including a penny of transaction costs in 1Q:12, which lowers our 2012 EPS expectation to $0.59 from $0.60.  
Should we include the entire impact in our model, our 2012 EPS expectation would decrease to $0.55-0.56 and our 2013 EPS estimate 
would increase by $0.02-0.03.

Valuation 

Based on both consensus and our 2013 EPS expectations, Teavana is currently trading in line with its closest comparables.  Given the 
company’s brief trading history since its late July IPO, we do not believe a historical valuation analysis is appropriate.  Based on 
Teavana’s 36% expected EPS growth rate in 2013 relative to the peer average of 27%, a premium to peers would be appropriate.  
However,  within  the  context  of  our  expectation  that  there  is  risk  to  consensus  expectations,  combined  with  the  execution  risk  of 
integrating this relatively large-sized acquisition, we believe a valuation in line with the 26x peer multiple is appropriate.  Therefore, we 
initiate on shares of Teavana with a NEUTRAL rating and $21 price target, which represents a 26x multiple on our 2013 EPS estimate 
of $0.79 (Figure 25).

Investment Risks 
 
 
Decrease in Demand for Teas 
 
Teavana is heavily reliant on the sale of premium loose leaf teas and tea-related products, therefore any decrease in the demand of 
teas from changing consumer tastes away from teas to substitute products could adversely impact sales.   
 
Increasing Competition in the Beverage Industry 
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive with an abundance of substitutes for premium loose leaf teas. We believe that increased 
competition from other tea and beverage retailers could adversely impact sales.  
 
Sourcing of Teas 
 
Teavana is reliant on its ability to source a wide variety of premium loose leaf teas at reasonable prices. We believe that any failure to 
innovate, develop, source, or market new varieties of teas could negatively impact sales. Additionally, any rise in the prices of loose leaf 
teas could negatively impact Teavana’s margins. 
 
Expansion into New Markets 
 
As Teavana expands into new markets, there is a risk that the new unit openings may not achieve sales levels appropriate to meet the 
company’s return on investment hurdles. We believe that new store openings may place increased demands on management and 
distribution. Additionally, management does not have the experience of opening the number of new stores that are planned annually.  
 
Deterioration in Economic Conditions 
 
The  company  is  dependent on  consumer  confidence  and  spending  and  any  deterioration  in  economic conditions  could adversely 
impact sales. We believe that sales could be negatively impacted by rising unemployment rates and increases in fuel and other energy 
costs.

Analyst Certification 
I, Nick Setyan, certify that the views expressed in this report accurately reflect my personal opinion and that I have not and will not, directly or

Disclosure information regarding historical ratings and price targets is available at  http://www.wedbush.com/ResearchDisclosure/DisclosureQ112.pdf 
 
Investment Rating System:   
Outperform: Expect the total return of the stock to outperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Neutral: Expect the total return of the stock to perform in-line with the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Underperform: Expect the total return of the stock to underperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) 
coverage universe over the next 6-12 months. 
 
The Investment Ratings are based on the expected performance of a stock (based on anticipated total return to price target) relative to the 
other stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe (or the analyst’s team coverage).*

The Distribution of Ratings is required by FINRA rules; however, WS’ stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and Underperform most closely 
conform to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively. Please note, however, the definitions are not the same as WS’ stock ratings are on a relative 
basis.  
 
The  analysts  responsible  for  preparing  research  reports  do  not  receive  compensation  based  on  specific  investment  banking  activity.  The 
analysts receive compensation that is based upon various factors including WS’ total revenues, a portion of which are generated by WS’ 
investment banking activities.
