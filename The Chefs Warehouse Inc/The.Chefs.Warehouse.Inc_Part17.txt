                                      Valuation 

                                      We are raising our price target to $26, 15% upside from Fridays close                    . Our new price 
                                      target values CHEF on a FY13 EV/EBITDA of 12.0x. We believe valuing CHEF on FY13 is 
                                      more appropriate given several one-time cost headwinds in FY12. The FY13 multiple may 
                                      appear generous on the surface, but given the           significant opportunities  to continue growing 
                                      share, gain efficiencies, and grow earnings, we believe the multiple is warranted.

                                      I. Several headwinds should abate in FY13  leading us to raise our EPS estimate by 
                                      $0.04.  In FY12, we are looking for a 24% increase in EPS despite approximately $0.09 in 
                                      incremental costs associated with 1) an estimat          ed 20% increase in diesel costs ($0.02 with 
                                      diesel remaining at current levels), 2) incremental costs associated with SOX compliance 
                                      ($0.05), and 3) a 41% tax rate versus the 39.5% reported in FY11 ($0.02). (The company will 
                                      also incur costs associated with duplicate rent   with no corresponding revenue at the second 
                                      facility of $0.03 but these costs are excluded from our FY12 EPS.) Excluding these one-
                                      times, we would have been looking for a 36% increase in EPS. In FY13, while diesel costs are 
                                      likely to remain high, it seems unlikely diesel will  increase as much as the increase experienced 
                                      in the first part of this year, costs associated  with SOX compliance are  likely to linger but not 
                                      increase, the second facility in New York will come on line and will generate incremental 
                                      revenues and efficiency savings, and the tax rate will remain flat at 41%  so EPS will no 
                                      longer be pressured by these headwinds. As a result, our upwardly revised EPS of $1.17  up 
                                      22% from FY12  appears conservative relative to the companys core EPS growth in FY12.  

                                      II. In our industry ranking report  most recently published in January 2012, CHEF  
                                      although excluded from the published report (because we were restricted on the name at 
                                      the time)  ranked #2 in our coverage universe              . Our rankings looked at a wide range of 
                                      metrics including Debt/EBITDAR, top-line growth, EBITDA margins, ROIC, valuation and 
                                      free cash flow yield. The company with the best  metric in each category received 14 points, the 
                                      worst received one point and the re sults were tallied. CHEF recei ved a total of  57 points, and

BMO Capital Markets                                                                                           Chefs' Warehouse 
                                   
                                      a)   Several initiatives are underway to continue to gain share organically          . These 
                                           initiatives include expanding the sales force, targeting a wider range of restaurant 
                                           formats, and partnering with vendors to increase product penetration in specific 
                                           categories. As indicated on the 4Q call, the company is currently focused on expanding 
                                           the sales force (a 15% increase in FY12) in order to increase penetration with existing 
                                           accounts (penetration of 1,00 0 SKUs per customer is considered underpenetrated) as 
                                           well as gain traction with new accounts. In   addition, the companys goal is to assign 
                                           each sales person 65 accounts. Today, the num ber skews considerably higher  leading 
                                           to a less effective selling effort. With the   expanded sales force, the company should 
                                           gain more traction on gaining a greater share of wallet with both new and existing 
                                           customers. In addition, we believe CHEF will continue to evolve and refine its 
                                           definition of the target market as the in dustry evolves. As an example, the company 
                                           had previously focused primarily on the $15 or  higher plate  but the trend to offer 
                                           smaller plates (or Tappas) has recently accelerated (in part due to persistent inflation in 
                                           protein) and CHEF recognizes that this format represents a significant growth 
                                           opportunity. Lastly, more recently, the company began pa  rtnering with select (smaller) 
                                           specialty vendors to meet with existing customers in an effort to increase penetration of 
                                           a particular product category. These vendors lack the ability to scale up to sell their 
                                           product with an internally developed sales force (i.e., small producers in Europe), so by 
                                           partnering with CHEF, the vendor is introduced to a national customer base through 
                                           CHEF relationships. In exchange for the introduction, the vendor provides (and pays 
                                           for) both a representative and the inventory  and both the vendor representative and 
                                           the CHEF sales representative will meet with a wide range of accounts to introduce the 
                                           product. This initiative (while in the early  stages) has been extremely successful so far 
                                           because the vendor specialist provides more immediate credibility on the quality of a 
                                           particular product, as a result, the effort has,  so far, resulted in both an uptick in initial 
                                           sales as well as higher order retention. 

                                      b)  Acquisitions remain a significant area of focus (although our FY13 estimates do not 
                                           reflect incremental revenues associated with  acquisitions)  and we continue to see 
                                           significant opportunities to gain share through select, accretive acquisitions of specialty 
                                           distributors in both existing and new geographies (e.g., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
                                           Atlanta). We also believe product line extensions (focusing initially on protein, 
                                           followed by produce) represent a signific  ant area of opportunity once the company 
                                           gains excess capacity at the new facility in New York. We believe management is 
                                           generally agnostic on product category versus  geographic expansion  as long as both 
                                           are accretive. The goal is to build the brand and gain share. 

                                      c)  Longer term, we believe the CW brand could ultimately encompasses a: Chefs 
                                           Warehouse Protein division (with separate invoices and credit terms), a Chef Direct 
                                           division for online purchases, a Chef Outlet  similar to the Restaurant Depot 
                                           concept  but with CHEFs emphasis on specialty, gourmet and import (Restaurant 
                                           Depot tends to skew more towards basic food products as well as sundry and 
                                           equipment),  and even the potential to develop product line extensions for some of the 
                                           companys more established restaurant chai ns (and chefs). Some of these goals are

                                           clearly long term in nature but they all speak to managements commitment to build a 
                                           brand and become a dominant force in the specialty distribution space.  

                                      II. Initiatives to drive greater efficiencies include the following:  

                                      a) Transitioning to the new facility in New York. This will drive significant cost savings 
                                      because under the current configuration the co mpany operates two facilities. The existing 
                                      facilities are extremely inefficient due to capac ity constraints and both facilities incur rent 
                                      and general overhead expenses. With the new facility, total rent expense should remain 
                                      more or less unchanged (because the new facility   is larger, and lease rates will likely be 
                                      higher), utility expenses should decline, but the company should gain significant cost 
                                      savings due to improved efficiency.  

                                      b) Once the transition is complete, the company should be able to implement more effective 
                                      labor management tools at the new facility. The current facility is too antiquated and 
                                      strained to fully utilize the tools associated with the roll-out of the system. 

                                      c) In 3Q11, the company introduced a price       optimization tool to the sales force  this 
                                      should help improve the companys selling efforts and also preserve (or improve) product 
                                      margins. 

                                      III. The transition to the new facility in New York should be completed by mid 2013         .  
                                      The company then plans to sublease the current,  larger facility for the duration of the lease 
                                      (expiring in 2014). The lease on CHEFs smaller facility expires mid 2013. Higher 
                                      depreciation associated with the facility could impact EPS by $0.02-$0.035 ($~12 million 
                                      depreciated over the initial life of the lease  excluding renewal options)  but the new 
                                      facility will dramatically improve efficiencies and reduce significant duplicate costs 
                                      (largely rent and utilities)  more than offsetting the negative earnings impact from higher 
                                      depreciation. Execution risk with the transition will be low, in our view, given the new 
                                      facilitys proximity to the existing facilities  and this proximity (resulting in ease of 
                                      transition) was one of the companys primary considerations in remaining in New York.  

                                      IV. Higher fuel costs will likely impact EPS by $0.02 in FY12 assuming fuel remains 
                                      near current levels. The negative impact to EPS reflects a slight delay in passing on 
                                      fuel surcharges in the early part of the fiscal year    . Inbound freight costs should also 
                                      increase but will likely have no impact to earnings because product costs are fully landed 
                                       so inventory costs already reflect inbound transportation costs. Going forward, if fuel 
                                      continues to rise, we believe management will be more proactive on immediately 
                                      increasing the surcharge in order to mitigate an additional impact to EPS.
