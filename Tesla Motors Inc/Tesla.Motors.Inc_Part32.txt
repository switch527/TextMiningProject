      Tesla reports higher-than-consensus results                                                       24
      Tesla reported EPS of -$0.37 (ex items) vs cons of -$0.43.  Rev was up 10%                        20
      sequentially and product gross margin rose to 19.1% (vs 15.6% in 2Q10). After an                  16
      est'd ~$45 MM cash burn in the quart er, Tesla still has $242 MM cash and $408                    12
      MM avail under its DOE loan facility. We believe this should be sufficient to bridge                6/10

      Although Teslas 3Q financials were not           particularly meaningful in terms of         
      assessing the companys long term earnings potential, we were nonetheless                      Stock & option liquidity data 
      encouraged by continued progress in two  important areas:  1) Progress towards                 Market Cap (USDm)                                                           1,240.3

      Model S Powertrain prototypes are being ro ad tested; Alpha build prototypes of                Option volume (und. shrs., 1M avg.)       
      the Model S vehicle (80-90% of a productio  n vehicle, but built as a low volume              
      prototype) will be on the road  at the end of this quar ter; nearly 100% of supplier 
      sourcing will be complete by the end of the quarter;  15 dealerships are now open.   
      and external validations continue 
      2) Tesla continues to gain external vali     dation of its technology, through supply 
      agreements with Daimler (Tesla is now de livering production parts for the A-Class 
      and Smart fortwo) and Toyota (Tesla formalized a $60 MM contract for 
      development of an entire electric powertr        ain and battery pack for an electric 
      version of the RAV4), and a new $30 MM investment from Panasonic, a world 
      leader in lithium ion battery technology.    In addition, we have  noted that these 
      development contracts are reasonably profitable in their own right (68% margin in 
      Q3; likely 40%-45% over time).  In          other words, the new $60 MM Toyota 
      development contract likely  reduces the cash burn that  we had been anticipating 
      through Model S launch by $20-$25 MM. 
      Maintain $17 target price based on DCF; our long-term thesis is unchanged 
      We continue to view this company as a leader in the burgeoning Vehicle 
      Electrification space.  Our DCF assumes   a 7% terminal growth rate, a terminal 
      EBIT margin of 11.7% and a weighted av          erage cost of capital of 13.5%.  Key 
      downside risks include execution on            the scale up from niche to volume 
      manufacturing and risks associated with demand and average transaction price 
      assumptions.  Upside could be derive          d from higher-than-expected Model S 
      volumes or potential for the the compan  ys powertrain supply business (i.e. to 
      third party automakers) become a significant long term earnings generator.

10 November 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                      

                               Although Teslas 3Q financials were not particul  arly meaningful in terms of assessing the 
                               companys long term earnings potential (Tes  las Q3 results were primarily driven by 151 
                               Roadster units, and approximately $8 MM of Prod uct Development Services for Daimler and 
                               Toyota), we were nonetheless encouraged by continued progress in two important areas:   

                                    Tesla continues to make progress towards co mmercial production of the (20,000 unit/yr) 
                                    Model S, expected to launch in mid-2012       Tesla completed the purchase of its 
                                    production facility in Fremont, Ca; Model S Powertrain prototypes are being road tested; 
                                    Alpha build prototypes of the Model S vehicle  (80-90% of a production vehicle, but built 
                                    as a low volume prototype) will be on the road  at the end of this quarter; the company is 
                                    on track to produce Beta Prototypes (95-   99% of production design, 50% built with 
                                    production tooling) by the middle of next  year; nearly 100% of supplier sourcing will be 
                                    complete by the end of the quarter;  15 dealerships are now open.   
                                    Tesla continues to gain external validation  of its technology, through supply agreements 
                                    with Daimler (Tesla is now delivering produ ction parts for the A-Class and Smart fortwo) 
                                    and Toyota (Tesla formalized a $60 MM contract  for development of an entire electric 
                                    powertrain and battery pack fo r an electric version of  the RAV4), and a new $30 MM 
                                    investment from Panasonic, a world leader in lithium ion battery technology.  In addition, 
                                    we have noted that these development contra cts are reasonably profitable in their own 
                                    right (68% margin in Q3; likely 40%-45%  over time).  In other words, the new $60 MM 
                                    Toyota development contract likely reduces th e cash burn that we had been anticipating 
                                    through Model S launch by $20-$25 MM. 

                               In terms of quarterly financia l performance, Teslas revenue rose by 10% sequentially but 
                               declined yoy (Roadster production was strong  in 3Q09 while the company worked down a 
                               large backlog of orders).  Gross profit rose  to $9.3 MM from $6.3 MM in Q2 and $7.7 MM in 
                               3Q09.  Operating expenses rose to $47 MM,  which was slightly lower than the $52 MM we 
                               were expecting due to timing of Supplier R&  D reimbursements.  Operating loss was $38 
                               MM vs. our $46 MM estimate.  We estimate that  cash burn was ~$45 MM in the quarter, 
                               and that Tesla still has $242 MM cash and $408 MM available under its DOE loan facility, 
                               which we believe should be sufficient to bridge the company to the launch of the Model S.  

                               Our long term investment thesis on Tesla is unchanged.  We continue to view this company 
                               as a leader in the burgeoning Vehicle Electrif ication space.  Our DCF valuation implies a $17 
                               target for TSLAs shares, with potential   upside should the company powertrain supply 
                               business (i.e. to third party automakers) become a significant long term earnings generator. 

                                

                               Valuation / Risks 

                               Our price target is based on a DCF analys      is. Valuing Tesla presents a unique set of 
                               challenges, given the fact that company revenue won't accelerate until 2012 and beyond. We 
                               believe that DCF is the most appropriate valuation method in this case. We assume 7% 
                               terminal growth beginning in 2020 (given our proje ction that Tesla will still be building out its 
                               vehicle portfolio and that only 9.5% of global sales will be vehicles able to be fueled from the 
                               grid in 2020, we believe that a 7% growth rate   is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT 
                               margin of 11.7% and a weighted average cost  of capital of 13.5% (we calculate WACC by 
                               using 15% cost of equity and 3.3% cost of   DOE debt and weight this over the expected 
                               capital structure from 2010 - 2014).

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.
