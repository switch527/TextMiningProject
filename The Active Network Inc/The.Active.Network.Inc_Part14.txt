Broadband Mobility and                        2012
Communications Infrastructure
                                              While we have no call on the global macro outlook, we see Broadband Mobility as a
                                              major theme in 2012 with several major disruptors and technology upgrades on the way.
                                              Specifically, we believe 1) 4G/LTE will come to mass market smart phones and tablets
                                              in 2H12 and drive new infrastructure shifts including carrier WiFi, small cells, and IP
                                              adaptive traffic management, 2) we believe Windows8 on ARM will offer low-cost/high
                                              performance/longer battery life as mobile technologies penetrate the PC market from
                                              the bottom-up, 3) Apple will disrupt the TV industry with its iTV, and 4) lower cost access
                                              solutions will bring broadband to the "have nots" in developed and developing regions.

Infrastructure Software
                                               We expect the security group to have an especially strong year on fundamentals
                                               in 2012, with solid demand (e.g. revenue growth of 12%, 2-3x the rate of global IT
                                               spending growth) and product news in firewall, intrusion prevention, encryption, and
                                               data protection. Key underlying trends in IT which are driving demand for security
                                               should continue to be virtualization in the data center, cloud adoption, managed service
                                               adoption, and the nightly news. We regard newsflow, apart from product introductions
                                               and potential IPOs, as a regular catalyst for the security group. While unfortunate,
                                               network-driven attacks on institutions and brands, denial of service extortion, data theft
                                               and cyber-warfare are part of the new normal of online communication, commerce and
                                               social dependency.
