        IBM to acquire Emptoris; net positive for Tangoe            Reuters:TNGO.OQ Exchange:NMS Ticker:TNGO
                                                                                      

        Price (USD)              14.53 IBM (Buy, USD188.72) this morning announced that it is acquiring Emptoris,
                                       a provider of on-demand supply chain software.  We note that Rivermine,

                                       a smaller telecom expense management (TEM) competitor of Tangoe, was
        52-week range          14.83 - 8.75recently acquired by Emptoris.  We believe the Emptoris acquisition is fo-
        Market cap (USD)          471.3cused on IBM's efforts to beef up its software business.  IBM's relationship
                                       with Tangoe is on the consulting (Global Services) side of the business and
        Shares outstanding (m)        32.4
                                       we therefore don't see the Rivermine segment as directly competitive or
        Free float (%)             100 disruptive to the IBM partner relationship.
        Volume (14 Dec 2011)     217,800As a byproduct of the IBM-Emptoris deal, we also see the possibility of
        S&P 500 INDEX           1,211.82Tangoe being able to acquire the Rivermine customer base, in case IBM
                                       decides to focus purely on the supply chain assets of Emptoris.
