INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and scale undoubtedly offers 
advantages. While the company is a relatively recent IPO and still establishing a reputation 
with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry and already proven investor 
concerns of cyclicality are unwarranted. We simply believe that if CHEF can achieve the 
top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, it can replicate 
this success in any major market. There is no market in the US with a larger base of menu-
driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging logistical 
environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food palates 
anywhere in the country. With an expertise in leveraging its supplier and sourcing 
relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or more readily available 
list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and tangible proof that it can 
dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there is ample reason to be 
comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success into a geographical growth opportunity 
that should ensure ample opportunity for consistent long-term growth. 

Q4 RESULTS 

CHEF reported Q4 results last night that exceeded both our and consensus expectations. 
Revenues increased 27.2% to $116.5 million vs. our and consensus estimates of $107.8 
million and $113.2 million, respectively, as higher-than-forecast organic growth along with 
stronger sales performance from recent acquisitions of Provvista and Harry Wils delivered 
upside. Excluding these two acquisitions, which added $9.2 million, as well as a fourteenth 
week in the quarter that contributed $6.6 million, CHEF posted a 9% organic growth rate 
vs. our 7% estimate.  

Gross margin continued to expand YOY, coming in at 26.6% vs. our 26.3% estimate, and 
we think the stronger margins are likely to continue. Given CHEF’s performance with 
optimizing pricing and delivering margin enhancement, we have increased our forward 
estimates for gross margin to the mid-26% range. Pro forma operating margin for the 
quarter was also quite strong, having posted a 180 basis point YOY increase to 8.5%, 
which was above our forecast of 8.1% given the aforementioned gross margin 
performance, and the higher sales volumes aided expense leverage. On a GAAP basis, 
earnings for the quarter came in at $0.25. On an adjusted basis, EPS were $0.26, which 
was ahead of the consensus forecast of $0.25 and our $0.24 estimate.  The Q4 results were 
strong across the board and add to our confidence in our F2012 forecasts for growth and 
margin performance.

                                                    For F2012, initial guidance was given with revenues in the range of $450 million to $460 
                                                    million and GAAP EPS of $0.88 to $0.93. Within the 16%-18% implied revenue increase, it 
                                                    is expected that roughly 8% come through acquisition and there is no adjustment for 
                                                    inflation, which is likely to add to sales growth. The pro forma EPS range given was for 
                                                    between $0.91 and $0.96, and the $0.03 differential between the two guidance ranges 
                                                    reflect an anticipated impact from duplicate rent and lease fees for a new NYC distribution 
                                                    center that should be announced over the next quarter and placed into service in F2013. 
                                                    We added in these non-recurring costs beginning in Q2.

ESTIMATE REVISIONS 

Following Q4 financial results, we are updating our forecasts for the upside and 
momentum heading into F2012. We are making no change to F2012 EPS estimate of $0.95 
as a 15 basis point impact from higher fuel costs and an increased effective tax rate 
assumption of 41% from 39% (trims $0.03 of EPS) offset our increased revenue forecasts. 
The company is also targeting higher operating expenses than we had forecasted, but this 
reinvestment is mostly offset by a stronger gross margin assumption. Our F2012 revenue 
forecast is increasing by approximately $14 million to $456 million to account for the 
stronger-than-expected internal growth rate and better performance from recently 
acquired businesses. For F2013, we are again maintaining our EPS estimates while 
increasing revenue to $504.2 million from $479.5 million.

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 22.5x our 2012 EPS forecast and 
10.8x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiples of 12.4x earnings and 7.0x EBITDA, the valuation is 
comparable to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United 
Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $44.24 | Buy). We view UNFI as the best comparison for 
CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins relative to most 
distributors (yet at 18%, its gross margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in 
its segment as is CHEF. We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its 
distribution peers (as UNFI does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and 
higher returns on invested capital.  

We maintain our price target of $24.00 as this reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast. Our 
targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of the specialty 
food peer group (twice the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the unattractive 
comparison to the low valuations afforded the traditional food distribution peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

•   A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
    commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
    consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have 
    had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. 
    Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

•   Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, 
    the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and 
    spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness 
    have impacted the performance of the shares. 

•   Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in 
    the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies 
    with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and 
    United Natural Foods. 

•   Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
    Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's 
    total sales originated from the New York market.  

•   Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history 
    and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is 
    highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
    acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of 
    key personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or 
    distribution gains.  

•   Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
    concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands 
    sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

•   Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state 
    and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require 
    various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar 
    regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food 
    products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public 
    awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and 
    organic products 

•   Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
    profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its 
    trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the 
    destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.
