                                   We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy recurring revenue
                                   growth  (+68%  Y/Y)  and  solid  customer  wins.  The  company  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide

                                   believe  the  company  can  deliver  double-digit  EPS/revenue  growth  through  a  variety  of  drivers  (e.g.,
                                   greenfield opportunities, penetrate spend at existing customers, international expansion, drive leverage

                                   resources on the large opportunities present on the recurring revenue side of the business). We are
                                   particularly impressed with at least ~25-30% organic revenue growth and note adjusted EBITDA grew
                                   83% Y/Y to $3.3M. While MDM represents less than 10% of revenue today, we believe this segment
                                   represents a LT growth opportunity as mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) proliferate the corporate
                                   network.

                                   Tangoe closed 25 new customers during the quarter (vs. 25 new logos last quarter) and continues to
                                   displace competitors and home-grown systems. It is clear to us that Tangoe is executing on its plan to
                                   increasingly drive CLM spend through its platform, with total spend under management now at $15.3B,
                                   up  61.1%  Y/Y  and  5.5%  Q/Q.  Given  low  penetration  rates  at  existing  customers  (~33%  penetrated)
                                   and a large greenfield opportunity (~80% of companies use home grown systems), we expect Tangoe
                                   to continue driving spend through its platform for the foreseeable future.

                                   Regarding  the  macro  environment, management  highlighted  it  has  not  seen  any  impact  to  its
                                   business from macro headwinds and notes its pipelines are "robust." We believe Tangoe is relatively
                                   insulated   should   the   macro   environment   further   deteriorate   since:   1)   Tangoe's   contracts   are
                                   longer-term in duration (while contracts range from 2-5 years, the typical contract runs 2-3 years); and
                                   2)     Tangoe's     TEM     and     MDM     solutions     drive     ROI,     improve     efficiencies,     and     reduce
                                   compliance/regulatory/security   risks,   all   of   which   provide   an   additional   layer   of   stickiness.   As   a
                                   reminder, Tangoe delivered >20% organic recurring revenue growth during the '08/09 recession.

                                   Big win at IBM. In addition to the 25 new customers closed during the quarter, Tangoe highlighted a
                                   big win at IBM, where it closed a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement. In particular, Tangoe will
                                   deploy  fixed  TEM  solutions  (invoice  bill  processing)  and  is  replacing  a  combination  of  home-grown
                                   systems and third-party vendors. While we do not expect revenue until FY12, this deal is another signal
                                   the company is able to up/cross-sell its installed base. Separately, recall that IBM (along with Dell, HP,
                                   and Xerox) is one of Tangoe's key strategic partners and, together, alliances represent ~25% of new
                                   annual recurring revenue.

                                   International  expansion  provides  a  large  growth  opportunity. About  $4.1B  of  the  $15.3B  CLM
                                   spend managed is internationally domiciled (which is up 37% Y/Y and 17% Q/Q). However, much of
                                   this spend is just US-based, multi-national spend overseas. While Tangoe believes there is plenty of
                                   runway left to further penetrate US-based multi-national spend, the company believes that over 50% of
                                   the  $425B  in  global  CLM  spend  is  from  international  corporations  (much  of  which  is  greenfield
                                   opportunities).  To  that  end,  we  expect  Tangoe  to  build  out  its  European,  Asia  Pacific,  and  Latin
                                   American presence throughout FY12 (for example, we estimate the company has ~30 quota-carrying
                                   sales  reps  and  will  look  to  increase  capacity  by  40%  in  the  coming  months).  Given  the  large  and
                                   dynamic market opportunity, we believe this reinvestment makes sense, yet still expect the company to
                                   balance these efforts with margin expansion.

Leverage  in  the  model. The  integration  of  HCL  and  Telwares  (both  acquired  during  1Q11)  is
progressing  nicely.  Recall  that  HCL/Telwares  operated  at  lower  gross  margins  than  Tangoe,  which
have  served  as  a  short-term  drag  to  overall  margins  (gross  margin  dropped  to  52.1%  at  2Q11  from
57%  at  4Q10).  It  typically  takes  Tangoe  12-18  months  to  fully  transition  acquired  clients  to  its  CLM
platform  (from  the  acquired  platform)  and  we  expect  HCL/Telwares  should  be  no  different.  To  date,
Tangoe has transitioned a "minority" of customers and we believe it takes 1-2 quarters post-transition
to  see  margin  improvement  (HCL/Telwares  installations  have  third-party  costs  which  are  no  longer
needed  when  clients  migrate  to  Tangoe's  CLM  solution).  We  also  expect  Tangoe  to  successfully
up/cross-sell  legacy  HCL/Telwares  customers  to  its  comprehenisve  TEM/MDM  product  suite  upon
migration.  Bottom  line,  we  believe  Tangoe  can  drive  sequential  Q/Q  margin  improvement  and  are
pleased  to  see  the  combined  company's  margin  profile  back  up  to  52.8%  during  3Q11.  We  also
anticipate gross margin can revert back to the mid-56% range next year.

Tangoe is not afraid to acquire technology, clients, and/or geographic presence. Through much
of its history, Tangoe has used acquisitions to augment its organic growth. Over the past four years,
Tangoe  acquired  five  companies  in  order  to  obtain  new  technology,  grow  its  customer  base,  and
extend its geographic reach. Overall, these deals allowed the firm to develop and integrate a holistic
CLM  offering  and  up-sell/cross-sell  its  combined  CLM  suite  to  a  larger  installed  base.  With  the
HCL/Telwares  acquisitions  in  the  rear-view  mirror,  we  expect  TNGO  to  continue  its  M&A  strategy  to
acquire  customers,  geography,  or  technology  to  augment  the  company's  ~20%  organic  recurring
revenue growth goals. Given the robustness of its CLM platform, we suspect the company may initially
focus  on  customers  /  geographic-based  acquisitions  over  technology-based  ones  in  the  short  term.
However, we expect Tangoe to continue to engage in tuck-in acquisitions across all three axes over
the next few years in order to scale and capture share.

Altogether,  we  continue  to  believe the  CLM  market  is  still  in  its  earliest  stages  of  growth,  as
enterprises are just beginning to address the need to centrally manage a disparate inventory of fixed
and  mobile  assets.  This  function  should  only  increase  in  importance  as  enterprises  connect  mobile
devices  (smartphones,  tablets)  to  the  corporate  network  at  an  accelerating  pace.  As  a  result  of  this
growing  complexity,  companies  will  have  to  move  off  outdated,  home-grown  systems  to  effectively
manage  telecom  resources.  Given  Tangoe's  leadership  position  in  the  CLM  space  (Tangoe  is  more
than 3X larger than its nearest competitor and is the only player to combine TEM/MDM in one solution)
and    a    healthy    moat    (Tangoe's    CLM    solution    supports    16    languages,    125    currencies,    200
countries/territories,  1,900  billing  formats,  1,700  carriers  globally,  and  was  awarded  12  patents),  we
believe the company should be able to effectively capture this large opportunity and deliver double-digit
EPS/revenue growth for the foreseeable future.

Tangoe's Revised Outlook

Tangoe raised its 2011 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $103.2-103.6M (versus its prior outlook of
$101.4-102.2M) and adjusted its non-GAAP EPS guidance to $0.25 (versus its prior outlook of
$0.24-0.25). The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA range to $12.2-12.4M from $11.8-12.2M as
a  result  of  the  strength  in  the  quarter  and  better  visibility  into  the  remainder  of  the  year.  TNGO
assumes a 7% tax rate for the full year and about 33.7M shares outstanding.

For 4Q11, Tangoe expects non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.07 and $27.5-27.9M. The company
also expects adjusted EBITDA to come in at $3.2-3.4M and assumes a 7% tax rate and 38.5M shares
outstanding.

Changes to our Model
Following TNGO's solid 3Q11 results and revised outlook, we've adjusted our model. We have
increased our CY11E EPS and revenue to $0.25/$103.6M from $0.25/$102.0M, reflecting the recent
momentum  in  and  TNGO's  improved  outlook  for  the  business.  We  note  our  CY11  free  cash  flow
forecast also improved to $7.7M (vs. $7.1M). We similarly raised our CY12 EPS estimate to $0.39 (vs.
$0.38), revenue forecast to $121.3M (vs. $117.9M), and FCF estimate to $16.6M (vs. $14.8M). A more
detailed breakout of our model changes is contained in the exhibit below:

Tangoe

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $16 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.7x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $109.7M. We note the SaaS
  peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (its
  MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to SaaS architecture by end of
  next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the "stickiness" of its installed
  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,  subscriptions  model),  its  robust  growth  rates  (40%  five-year  CAGR),
  market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with
  its peers, which leads us to our $16 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.
