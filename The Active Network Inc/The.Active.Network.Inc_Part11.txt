ThinkClean Tech
                                               Approaching the 2012 construction season, we take a step back to consider costs in
                                               addition to price to ground ourselves after the recent rally in solar names. The apparent
                                               investor optimism evident to us in rising industry prices and positive sentiment for the
                                               equities of wafer, cell and module manufacturers lead us to look for reasons to come
                                               off our generally bearish near term view. But, given recent pricing checks and after
                                               revisiting our cost estimates, we continue to be cautious on manufacturing margins
                                               given our view of limited potential for cost savings and ongoing rationalization of prices.
                                               We return to our positive recommendation for equipment suppliers as the industry
                                               moves production to 19% efficient cells from the current 16.5%.
