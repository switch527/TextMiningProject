                                            Updated 2012 Plan
                                            Tesoro announced its 2012 business plan, which should result in 2013 EBITDA of $100 million.
                                            The highlights of the plan are capital expenditures of $100 million between 2012 and 2013 and
                                            the acquisition of a crude oil terminal from Tesoro Corporation.
                                            The partnership plans to spend $60 million on its High Plains System, which should continue to
                                            benefit from growth in the Bakken. This system should realize benefits from growth at Tesoro
                                            Corporation's Mandan and Anacortes refineries. In addition, the partnership is expanding its
                                            trucking fleet to increase volumes. Capital spending should total $60 million, which should
                                            result in an EBITDA contribution of $20 million to $25 million. The capital spending includes
                                            some previously announced projects.

                                            Spending  on  the  Terminals  segment  is  budgeted  at  $40  million,  which  should  lead  to
                                            an EBITDA contribution of $5 million to $10 million. The partnership's goal is to grow
                                            terminalling volumes over 40,000 barrels per day by the end of 2013.

                                            The  partnership's  first  dropdown  from  its  parent  will  be  the  Martinez  Crude  Oil  Marine
                                            Terminal in Martinez, CA. The asset should generate $8 million in EBITDA annually and is
                                            supported by a 10-year commitment with two five-year renewals. The transaction should close
                                            by the end of 1Q12 or the beginning of 2Q12 and should be financed with Tesoro's credit
                                            facility. The purchase price has not been disclosed yet.

                                            Distribution
                                            We are maintaining our 2011 distribution estimate at $0.9548/unit, increasing our 2012 estimate
                                            to $1.56/unit from $1.54/unit and upping our 2013 estimate to $1.83/unit from $1.70/unit. Our
                                            estimates provide a 17.3% growth rate in 2013. Our distributable cash flow estimate are $2.22/
                                            unit for 2012 and $2.60/unit in 2013, which equates to coverage ratios of 1.4x for both years.
                                            Our estimates do not include any further asset dropdowns.

                                            Estimates
                                            We are keeping our 2011 EBITDA estimate at $42.2 million and increasing our 2012 EBITDA
                                            estimate to $79.6 million from $72.8 million. We are maintaining our 2011 DCF estimate at
                                            $39.5 million upping our 2012 DCF estimate to $69.4 million from $67.1 million.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $33 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of return
   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $38.08.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.
