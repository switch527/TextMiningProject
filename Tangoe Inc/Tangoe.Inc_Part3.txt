 Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance tweaked up                                                                 
                                                                                                             
 Tangoe delivered a modest beat on estimates at $34.1m/$0.09 vs. our 
                                                                                          Price/price relative 
 $33m/$0.07 and consensus of $33m/$0.08.  Guidance was tweaked up on 
 revenue and EBITDA, with EPS adjusted down 1c (after the 2c dilution) from                  24
 the 2.2m primary shares issued as part of the recent secondary                              20
 offering.  Integration of HCL and Telwares appear ahead of plan, which we 
 believe bodes well for Profitline.  Expense under management and new                        16
 customer adds were both healthy in the quarter and we reiterate our Buy                     12
 rating.                                                                                      8

 TNGO added 35 new customers in the quarter, higher than the typical range of                        S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)   
 20-30, we believe as a result of more salespeople from the recent acquisitions 
                                                                                         Performance (%)                             1m          3m        12m
 of ttMobiles and Anomalous Networks, both of which brought new technology 
 and the UK region.  Although the company has not increased its quarterly                Absolute -0.2        27.6               
 customer-add target, we think it is likely we will see a slightly elevation in this     S&P 500 INDEX                             -2.5           1.0           1.8
 quarterly metric.  Expense under management grew to $17.6bn, up 28% y/y      
 and 5% q/q, on the back new customer deployments.  Based on a $425bn 
 global spend estimate, TNGOs share has risen this past year from 3% to about 
 4%, still allowing for plenty of headroom for growth.  Our customer checks 
 also showed TNGO being recognized the leader in this space. 
 Margins probably have upside as migrations progress 
 The company expects to complete a majority of migrations from HCL and 
 Telwares customers (both early 2011 acquisitions) by the end of 2Q12, which 
 should help gross margins in the second half from higher automation and 
 better scale.  Profitline customers will be gradually migrated over the typical 4-
 6 quarter period.  With ttMobiles and rTEM products already richer in margin, 
 revenue mix should help aggregate margins over time.  The company 
 mentioned five rTEM wins in 1Q, a nice surprise for an acquisition that was just 
 completed in January 2012. 
 Reiterate Buy, raising PT to $26 from $25; risks 
 Our $26 price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.58 (from 
 $0.55), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.3x (slight premium to group given market 
 leadership position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 
 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
 projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing in-
 house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

1Q12 Review 

Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance tweaked up 

Tangoe delivered a modest beat on estimates at $34.1m/$0.09 vs. our $33m/$0.07 and 
consensus of $33m/$0.08.  Guidance was tweaked up on revenue and EBITDA, with 
EPS adjusted down 1c (after the 2c dilution) from the 2.2m primary shares issued as 
part of the recent secondary offering.  Integration of HCL and Telwares appear ahead of 
plan, which we believe bodes well for Profitline.  Expense under management and new 
customer adds were both healthy in the quarter and we reiterate our Buy rating. 

Key metrics: 
        Cash balance at the end of FY11 was $37.9m vs. $43.4m at the end of 4Q11. 

        Cash flow from operations was $3.5m in 1Q12 vs. 4.8m in 4Q11. 

        2Q12 guidance: Revenue of $35m-$35.5m revenue; Adj EBITDA $4.3m-$4.5m 
        and adjusted EPS of $0.09 on 41.7m shares. 

        FY12 guidance: Revenue of $142.3m-$144.3m, EBITDA $20.2m-$20.7m, 
        adjusted EPS of $0.41-$0.42 on 41.3m diluted shares.  Net effect of $0.02 
        dilution and $0.01 raise in margin profile is a $0.01 reduction vs. previous 
        guide.  Our last published model had taken this dilution into account.

Continuing to gain share 
TNGO added 35 new customer in the quarter, higher than the typical guided range of 
20-30, we believe as a result of more salespeople from the recent acquisitions of 
ttMobiles and Anomalous Networks, both of which brought new technology and the UK 
region.  While the company has not revised up its quarterly customer-add target, we 
think its likely we will see a slightly elevation in this quarterly metric.  Expense under 
management grew to $17.6bn, up 28% y/y and 5% q/q, on the back new customer 
deployments.  Based on a $425bn global spend estimate, TNGOs share has grown this 
past year from 3% to about 4%, still allowing for plenty of headroom for growth.  Our 
customer checks also showed TNGO being recognized the leader in this space. 

Figure 2 below shows the companys recent organic growth momentum.  We note that 
during FY11, the company reported $19.9m in annual inorganic contribution.  This leads 
to the computed organic rates in the 25% range.  We think the natural organic growth 
rate of the business is over 20%, with organic recurring revenue growth closer to 25%.

 Margins probably have upside as migrations progress 
 The company expects to complete a majority of migrations from HCL and Telwares 
 customers (both early 2011 acquisitions) by the end of 2Q12, which should help gross 
 margins in the second half from higher automation and better scale.  Profitline 
 customers will be gradually migrated over the typical 4-6 quarter period.  With 
 ttMobiles and rTEM products already richer in margin, revenue mix should help 
 aggregate margins over time.  The company mentioned five rTEM wins in 1Q, a nice 
 surprise for an acquisition that was just completed in December 2011.

Reiterate Buy, raising PT to $26 from $25; risks 

Our $26 price target (from $25) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.58 (from 
$0.55), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.3x (slight premium to group given market leadership 
position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 33%. Risks include 
integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new projects not ramping fast 
enough and customers taking expense processing in-house after early gains from 
Tangoe's platform.

Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or otherwise, in a manner inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including 
strategists and sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this report constitute the current judgement of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change 
without notice. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof in the event that any opinion, forecast or estimate set forth herein, changes or

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within  the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies 
to value the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for 
"Hold" rated stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at 
http://gm.db.com to determine the target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price 
fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not 
necessarily indicative of future results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy f rom customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a 
proprietary basis.
