Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.

the investment merits of the company are provided.

This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the
financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based
upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of
the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and
income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial
and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may
adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. In addition, investors in securities such
as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
