Investment Thesis 

Market Leader in a $10B+ SaaS Space 
 
Active Network is the market leader in  online events registration services  a 
$10B opportunity in North America only  which is highly fragmented and 
under-penetrated (Active is serving ~4% and ~6% of addressable registrations 
and organizations, respectively). The company has built strong competitive 
moats based on scale (handling 70MM+ registrations / year for 47K+ 
customers), technology (900+ R&D staff),  and deep domain expertise (10+ 
years of experience). Currently, it faces very limited competition  mostly 
from niche players with a few legacy relationships in their immediate vicinity.

Active Network enjoys a sizeable recurring revenue stream (about 85% of 
total revenue comes from exclusive multi-year contracts) and a large and 
diversified customer base. In addition, less than 5% annual revenue churn 
contributes significantly to the recurring nature of registration revenues and 
overall high revenue visibility. The companys model also benefits from built-
in leverage that starts to kick in as Active phases off duplicate R&D spend for 
legacy systems and off-line registrations migrate to online. 

Active Network has managed to build some very engaging Internet properties 
around the events it helps organize. The company is also investing in products 
with social / mobile / global capabilities as these tend to drive higher 
engagement, participation, and registrants. Social features such as user 
communities help create a loyal audience and drive higher traffic growth 
(unique visitors and total visits to Active websites increased 40%+ Y/Y in 
each of the past 9 months). A loyal audi ence and solid traffic, in turn, attract 
more organizers to Actives properties and create a virtuous network effect 
cycle. 

We are initiating coverage of Active Network with a Buy rating and $22 price 
target. We believe our estimates could prove conservative as Active continues 
to migrate existing customers to ActiveWorks  its technology platform.

Large and Fragmented Addressable Market 

While Active Network may be best-known for the registration of endurance 
events, including triathlons and marathons, on its Active.com website, its robust 
SaaS-based technology platform serves a much larger, highly fragmented market. 
The companys customers can be categorized into 20 key verticals forming four 
main groups (each contributing $50MM+ a year).

Actives total addressable market (TAM) is so large that it is almost difficult to 
conceptualize. According to the company, each year more than 800,000 
organizations in North America solicit and process more than 1.7B registrations 
for sports, outdoors, community, or business events.

Active Network works with over 47,000 of these organizations, processing more 
than 70MM registrations a year for them. This represents just 4%-6% market 
penetration and highlights the size of the untapped opportunity. In addition, 
while less than five percent of revenue is currently from international sources, 
we believe that market characteristics abroad are similar, and thus present a 
significant opportunity for Active Network. 

Chart 1: North America Event Registrations Market Penetration (2010)

Based on management estimates, the 1.7B annual event registrations generate 
more than $110B in activity fees. This translates into about $10B TAM in North 
America (based on an average 9% technology fee assumption). For comparison, 
Active Network generated $238MM in technology revenue in 2010, which 
represents roughly 2% market share. Following its recent IPO, Active Network 
has very strong balance sheet with over $139MM in cash, enabling the company 
to scale its business and to execute its growth plan and profitability goals. 

Active Network continues to expand its presence into other areas, including 
winter sports and the faith-based market, where it recently acquired Resort 
Technology Partners (RTP) and Fellowship Technologies, respectively. Post this 
acquisition, the Active Network platforms now serve over 3,500 churches and a 
number of popular ski resorts to sell tickets, activities, and manage rentals. 
RTP's systems are currently implemented by Aspen Skiing Company, Intrawest, 
Powdr Corp., SkiStar, Vail Resorts, and VERBIERStBernard, among others. 
Churches are not much different from other organizations (in terms of event and 
community management) and have the same set of needs as many of the other 
organizations Active currently serves. The companys comprehensive suite of 
solutions gives church organizers the tools to leverage their resources and best 
serve the people in their communities with the goal of growing revenues and 
operating more efficiently. We believe   that opportunities for growth in each

In addition, the SaaS space as a whole exhibits several characteristics that make 
it very attractive: 

      SaaS: a major platform shift      SaaS, as applied to business software, 
      represents a major transition in the IT landscape. Its significance rivals past 
      transitions, such as from mainframe computing to minicomputers, and from 
      minis to client / server computing. As                                        with most major IT transitions, we 
      expect the SaaS trend to last 10+ years. 

      SaaS: fastest growing segment of enterprise software         According to 
      Gartner Inc. data, revenue from SaaS-bas ed enterprise applications software 
      is forecast to grow at a 5-year C                                  AGR (2008-13) of 17.7%  significantly 
      outpacing the overall enterprise apps software market growth of 3.6%. 
      Penetration of SaaS within overall ente                                        rprise apps software is expected to 
      nearly double from 7% in 2008 ($6.4B out of $90.6B total) to 13% by 2013 
      ($14.4B out of $108.3B total).

Low Online Penetration 

Over the years, the manual (paper-based or spreadsheet-based) approach to 
event registrations has been gradually replaced by more sophisticated, organizer-
hosted custom applications and increasingly by tailored online applications 
running on platforms such as ActiveWorks  Active Networks organization-
centric cloud computing platform, which has transformed the way organizers 
manage, market, record, track, and share information about activities and events. 
Prior to using SaaS solutions, organizers had limited means to improve 
productivity. There was a clear lack of high quality products that addressed this 
fragmented market. Active Network developed a superior technology platform 
with deep domain expertise, which helped the company embed into the 
operational fabric of its customer base.

Since the beginning of 2011, Active has managed over $1.7B in gross 
registration fees through its proprietary cloud-based SaaS platform. The 
ActiveWorks platform architecture allows  it to efficiently provide vertically-
specialized, flexible and scalable applications to a large and diverse market.  

Active Network's biggest competitor today is pen and paper. For example, if a 
person wants to reserve a campsite, the state park will likely book the spot by 
writing down their information in a reservation book. Beyond pen and paper, 
Active is the largest company in the sp ace. The strength of its business lies in 
the core of its technology. Active has leveraged its key horizontal applications 
with the necessary vertical specific f eatures and functionality, allowing for 
broader reach and movement into adjacent market opportunities. The company 
developed a platform that addresses both sides of the market  the organizer and 
the customer. It has partnered with orga nizers to gain exclusive access to their 
activity inventory with SaaS applications and it has built the largest online 
communities dedicated to active participants (Active owns and operates the 
leading online communities for activity     participants such as Active.com, 
ReserveAmerica.com and LaxPower.com). These communities have been built 
as a by-product of SaaS systems and many activity organizers work to get access 
to Actives audience. The companys position in both markets is self-reinforcing, 
therefore, creating a network effect. 

While there are a number of smaller competitors, they are mostly regional 
players that not only have a limited range   of services but also  lack the scale, 
technology, and vertical expertise of Active Network. The company has a loyal 
customer base, with less than 5% annual registration revenue churn. Active 
Network is the leader in each of its major verticals and management believes 
that, overall, Active generates over 5x the revenue of its next largest competitor 
 Cvent, which operates in only one of Actives verticals, business events. With 
mostly niche players having few legacy relationships in their immediate vicinity, 

                                                                                                                   UBS 7

competition in online events registration is very fragmented and in our view 
poses no immediate threat to Actives competitive market positioning. 

 

High Revenue Visibility / Predictable Recurring 
Revenue 

About 85% of Active Networks revenue base consists of technology revenue 
composed of net registration and software revenue. Net registration revenue 
(~70% of total) is generated when a participant (in a customers event) 
completes a registration and pays the regi  stration fee (typical ly using a credit 
card). Once the credit card transaction is processed, Active receives the full 
payment (less processing fees) and retains ~$2 per registration + 6.5% of the net 
registration fee paid by the participant. The remainder is remitted (in about two 
weeks) to the customer organization. Software revenue (~15% of total) includes 
revenue from software licensing, hosting, maintenance, and implementation fees, 
with the majority of it related to legacy systems from acquired companies. As 
Active continues to migrate existing customers to ActiveWorks, software 
revenue is expected to decline as a percentage of technology (and total) revenue. 

Technology revenue comes from exclusive, multi-year contracts (usually 3-year 
agreements) and gives management very good visibility into revenue levels over 
a forward 9-12 month time frame. Historical annual revenue churn has been 
relatively low  less than 5%  and contributes largely to the recurring nature of 
revenue. In addition, the companys customer base is big (more than 47,000 
organizations) and diversified, helping further increase visibility and recurrence 
of revenue streams.

While Active Networks revenue currently exhibits pronounced seasonal 
patterns (with Q2 being the busiest quarter and Q4 the slowest), expansion into 
winter sports with the acquisition of  RTP represents an opportunity to smooth 
out seasonality. Expansion into other verticals and growth of marketing services 
can soften this seasonality even more.

Model with Built-in Leverage 

As a result of more than 25 acquisitions over the past 5 years, Active Network 
has accumulated more than a few customer s that license legacy systems for all 
or part of their needs. Since Active is contractually obligated to support these 
legacy systems, it effectively duplicates its R&D (supporting both ActiveWorks 
and licensed software). In 2010, the company spent roughly 60% of R&D on its 
new platform and 40% on legacy systems. While the company has been actively 
transitioning customers to ActiveWorks (where possible), management 
estimates that the migration to the new platform will require an additional 3-4 
years to complete. Once this process concludes, Actives annual R&D spend 
will be reduced noticeably, resulting in margin improvement of roughly 400bps 
over a period of 4 years.

Another built-in leverage in Actives model kicks in as off-line registrations 
move online. This is particularly true for the outdoors segment where the 
company maintains call centers for campground registrations and shares revenue 
with merchants such as Wal-Mart, REI, or Dicks Sporting Goods where 
hunting & fishing licenses are purchased at a kiosk or POS terminal. Once the 
migration to the online channel (accounting in 2010 for only ~9% of hunting & 
fishing license / permit issues and ~54% of campground registrations) 
accelerates, Active Network should expe                       rience a noticeable improvement in 
margins. This shift from off-line to online, however, is not happening very fast  
only about 2%-4% of Actives business tr  ansitions each year  but we expect 
acceleration over time.  We anticipate the potential for a significant tipping point 
to occur when online share eclipses 20%. 

 

Network Effect Driven by Compelling 
Community / Social Features 

Active Network websites community and                             social features attract increasing 
numbers of event participants who come  to share their experiences and keep in 
touch with fellow participants and event organizers. This attracts more event 
organizers to Actives platform which in turn drives more users to engage with 
their events, building a virtuous cycle that helps the company create value for 
participants and event organizers, thus attracting more customers and registrants.

The company is also expanding its reach      and distribution channels rapidly. 
Mobile traffic accounts for ~18% of total Active.com traffic (up from ~15% just 
a couple of months ago). Social fa  ns (Facebook and Twitter) already exceed 
1MM (up 105% Y/Y) and affiliate partners contribute more than 17MM visits 
per month. Active Network is growing its ecosystem actively, as social 
integration and sharing are primary driver s of traffic growth and conversion. In 
addition, Actives Web properties are very complementary to its technology 
services and a major source of activity registrations (for example, 35%-40% of 
endurance sports registrations originate on Active.com). 

 

Secular Growth in Online Advertising 

While currently, marketing services revenue is only ~15% of total revenue, it 
has the potential to deliver significant upside to our estimated growth for the 
segment as ad dollars continue shifting from off-line to online in an effort to 
catch up with changing content consumption trends. Additional growth can also 
come from increased advertising budgets once the macro environment improves 
and advertisers return to their normal ad spend levels. Marketing services 
revenue consists of online and integrated field marketing campaigns. According 
to management, the total is roughl    y equally split between commerce and 
advertising revenue. Online marketing services include online advertising, e-
mail marketing and targeted newsletter promotions. Field marketing services 
include event promotions, sponsorship     s, and sample placements, defined 
contractually with individual customers. A major marketing services customer 
of Active Network is ESPN  accounting for approximately 17% of marketing 
services revenue at current run rates (still only about 2% of total net revenue). 
We expect to see more advertisers showing up on Actives web properties as 
social features such as user communitie s and new investments in products with

social / mobile / global capabilities start driving higher engagement, 
participation, and registrants. Online advertisers will become another part of the 
virtuous cycle that reinforces the growth of a loyal audience and event 
organizers selecting Active Network as a service provider.

Major Growth Drivers 

Adding more organizations in existing markets. This increases the number of 
registrations that utilize Actives technol  ogy solutions. In its first and most 
mature customer vertical, triathlons, Actives built a customer base of over 70% 
of all events in the market. This compares to Actives overall business with 6% 
of the addressable North American mark et. We estimate that the other 94% of 
the market is still using traditional pen and paper methods or generally much 
less sophisticated automation tools. Actives long-term goal is to have all 
verticals replicate the success made in penetrating triathlons. 

Increasing online conversion rates. The company is working to get more of its 
existing customers participants to sign up online using Actives digital 
technology, rather than using traditi onal analog methods (such as calling, 
mailing in paper forms, or walking up to register for an activity). Actives 
leading technology platfo  rm and proven ROI is driving a transition to 
automation in the activity and events space  similar to the transition seen in the 
restaurant and travel space. 

Deepening relationships with existing customers, driving more participants to 
events, and more participants online, while also broadening product offerings. 

Acquisitions. We expect Active to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to 
drive growth. To date, the company has a very successful track record of 
acquiring and integrating companies. We expect Active to look for strategic fits 
to enter into new markets, expand its technology footprint, and to acquire new 
customers.  

International expansion. While Actives international business is still small, 
representing less than 5% of total revenue, international revenue increased by 
over 50% in the first half of 2011. We believe that international markets have 
the same fragmented characteristics, no cl ear market leader and a similar sized 
market opportunity as North America. We expect Active to expand its offerings 
to address this significant market opportunity. 

Recent launch of online affiliate program , which distributes comprehensive 
directory of activities and events. 

    •   Allows online marketers and publishers to earn revenue by directing 
        consumers to register for activities on Active.com, while also increasing 
        audience reach. 

    •   Value proposition for the affiliate is they obtain compelling local 
        content, in addition to added revenue via Actives affiliate offering. 

    •   Value proposition for event customers is they can dramatically expand 
        their reach just by using Actives software. 

    •   Platform affiliates include espnW, ESPN's content and digital business 
        initiative for women, a new collaboration exemplifying Actives 
        versatility and the impact that Active.com has on consumers who are a 
        natural audience for its products and services.

Another long-term initiative that could drive growth is the launch of a 
comprehensive lead generation program, Schwaggle; an e-commerce offering 
that can help to leverage Actives a  udience to drive demand for events and 
activities, again reinforcing why organizers benefit from using Actives software 
solutions. 

This program includes exclusive deals on fitness-related products and services 
for the Active consumer. It is one of the first programs to distribute offers 
through both email and Facebook, demonstrating how Active works closely with 
customers to innovate and strengthen connections with Actives consumers.

The Active Network, Inc.   5 December 2011 

Risk Analysis 

Integration of Recent Acquisitions 
Over the past five years, Active Network has acquired more than 25 companies, 
and five of those were strategic acquisitions that helped it expand into new 
markets or build competitive moats. As Active grows larger and more complex, 
we believe that it will become increasingly difficult to integrate new businesses. 
In addition, expansion into new verticals can impact margins negatively due to 
the inherent characteristics of the new bus iness and has been the cause of some 
lumpiness in revenue per registration in the past. For example, revenue per 
registration and average margins declin ed noticeably following the acquisition 
of ReserveAmerica (the US #1 campground reservations provider) in 2009. 
Campground revenue is inherently much lower per user than, for example, 
hunting or fishing registration revenue. Campground revenue is also largely the 
same online vs. off-line but Active has to maintain call centers that put pressure 
on COGS and contribute to a break-even margin for the vertical overall.  

Another example of a possible negative impact on Actives business model 
comes from the acquisition of Automated License Systems (the US #1 hunting 
& fishing license and permit technology provider) in 2008. Revenue per 
registration in this vertical is ~$3 online, but off-line, it is as low as $0.90 when 
users go to a bait & tackle store or a retailer such as Wal-Mart, REI, or Dicks 
Sporting Goods and purchase the license from a POS terminal or kiosk. While 
outdoors is the only segment where Active collects revenue both off-line and 
online, it represents about 40MM of the total 70MM registrations for 2010. Most 
recently in 3Q11, the company saw a 15% Y/Y increase in registrations (after 
the implementation of two state contracts, Ohio and California) but revenue per 
registration increased just 2% Y/Y (down 15% sequentially) and well below the 
average increase of 6% Y/Y for the prior six quarters. 

While the revenue mix each quarter will continue to impact average revenue per 
registration and result in some lumpiness, we believe that over time the quarterly 
variability will decline and overall revenue per registration will trend up as 
customers (in the outdoors segment) migrate online. We project a CAGR of 
~12% for the number of registrations and ~4% for average revenue per 
registration from 2011 to 2015.

Inability to Transition Existing Customers to 
ActiveWorks Platform 
Active Network serves a wide range of customers and the majority of them are 
already on ActiveWorks  the companys technology platform  at varying 
levels of integration. The company is  also transitioning to ActiveWorks certain 
customers that are currently using both internally developed and acquired legacy 
systems. The transition process is time-consuming and requires investment in 
personnel and technology. Active Network evaluates the level of sophistication 
and compatibility with its internal systems to determine whether to integrate into 
ActiveWorks (expanding the platform capabilities) or migrate customers to 
ActiveWorks (replacing the legacy system with an alternative internal system). 
Retaining customers, especially in new verticals, thus often requires maintaining 
multiple legacy systems during the transition period and integrating some legacy 
systems into ActiveWorks at additional costs. Extended transition periods or 
inability to transition new and existing customers to ActiveWorks can result in 
material costs. Additionally, the bulk of operating margin improvement (and 
long-term management guidance) assumes a comprehensive integration of the 
acquired technology, a process that management estimates could take about 2-3 
years. Still, the recent appointment of  20-year global technology veteran Darko 
Dejanovic as Chief Technology, Product and Innovation Officer should help the 
company accelerate this process. Mr. Dejanovic has extensive expertise in 
growing global B2B and B2C technology and online media companies, which 
should be instrumental in advancing Active Networks technological innovation 
and growth. 

 

New Business Model and Limited History of Profitability 
Since its inception in 1998, Active Network has had only one (2Q11) profitable 
quarter. In addition, it has made various changes to its platform and offerings 
over time and as a result has a very limited operating history with its current 
business model. Although execution by management has been very strong, we 
think some risk of disruption in the business model remains. While Actives 
relations with existing customers tend to be strong, its business model is easily 
replicable. Established technology companies in the SaaS enterprise software 
space (Salesforce.com, Blackboard) and  companies in the event ticketing space 
(LiveNation) are a handful of possible competitors. However, we believe this 
possibility is remote, as the time and cost to build a customer base that supports 
a profitable business model are not immaterial (Active has 10+ years of 
experience and a solid customer base of 47,000+ organizations in the US). 

In terms of profitability, Active Network already generates positive FCF (on an 
annual basis) but its first positive net income quarter was 2Q11. We expect 
continuing losses in the near term and GAAP net income profitability (on an 
annual basis) in 2012.

Organizers Bringing Registrations In-House 

While we believe this is currently remote, the possibility that some event 
organizers may decide to bring their registrations in-house (rather than pay a 
6.5% processing fee) remains a threat to the companys business model. 
Generally, Actives contracts for technology services are exclusive 3-year 
agreements and customers tend to be very sticky. In addition, currently, no 
single customer contributes more than 5% of total revenue and the eventual loss 
of a big one should not have an unmanageable impact on the company. 

 

Deterioration of State / Municipal Budgets and Tough 
Government Agency Customers Requirements 

Continued state and municipal fiscal problems can have a negative impact on 
Actives business if they result in the closing of state / municipal parks and 
facilities serviced by the company. According to management, closures so far 
(particularly in California) have affected only non-revenue producing properties 
but continued budget deterioration can change this rapidly. In addition, many 
government agency customers impose add  itional requirements such as custom 
application features and service requirements (e.g. live call centers in certain 
states) that incur additional costs and can  negatively impact margin expansion. 
While a lot of Actives solutions actually generate revenue for the states, 
continued state and local budgetary pressure could have an impact if revenue-
generating state sites are closed. 

 

Limited Exposure to International Markets 

Currently, only a small fraction of Active Networks revenue comes from 
international sources. For 3Q11, the company reported just $2.8MM in 
international sales (almost $8MM for the first three quarters of the year), or 
about 3% of total. While this revenue stream grows faster than Actives 
domestic revenues (per management, 75% CAGR for 2005-2010), having 97% 
exposure to a single geographic area leaves the company overly dependent on 
North America. Whereas the company ini  tially just followed some of its large 

                                                                                                                                                                                                  UBS 20

become a catalyst for the stock. Among them is the companys 4Q CY2011 
earnings call expected in the second week of February 2012. In the meantime, 
any announcement of a major contract win, update on the progress of recent 
acquisitions integration (especially Resort Technology Partners and Fellowship 
Technologies), and news of successful transition of customers to ActiveWorks 
can act as a catalyst for the stock.

Active Network signs contracts with organizations to provide them with event 
and group management solutions that enable participants to register for their 
activity. The company generates revenue from technology fees paid by 
participants who register through Actives cloud computing applications for 
activities organized by Active Network customers. The technology fee is a 
percentage of the total registration amount paid by a participant at the time of 
sign-up. The consumer is charged the total event registration fee, including the 
technology fee. Technology fees are referred to as net registration revenue, since 
they are the direct result of participant registrations.  

Active Network has pursued a growth strategy focused on growing the number 
of customers it serves and increasing participant usage of online registration 
services by training customers in the execution of conversion techniques. The 
company plans to deepen its relationships with existing customers, pursue 
strategic acquisitions to strengthen market position, and expand internationally.

Key Questions                                            Issues 

The most important core drivers                          New customers, number of registrations, % of registrations completed online, revenue per 
                                                         registration. 
The most important financial metrics                     Revenue growth, segment revenue growth, operating costs. 

The most important environmental or social issues that could      Attempts to disrupt services or obtain sensitive information could impact online registrations growth, 
affect 1 and 2?                                          which is a key driver of financial performance. The overall level of event registrations could be 
                                                         impacted by adverse macro-economic conditions in the US and abroad. 
                                                          
The most important governance issues that could affect 1 and 2    Unsuitable acquisitions could hurt margins / profitability and distract management. 

The greatest opportunities and risks (business as usual) for firms   Opportunities exist in expanding into new verticals, increasing penetration into existing ones, and 
in the industry?                                         driving more registrations from the off-line to t he online channel. The greatest risks are competition 
                                                         and effective cost controls. 

Potential environmental, social, or governance catalysts  Interruption in services as a result of natural disasters or power outages, diminished reputation 
                                                         because of privacy/information concerns, continued macro-economic headwinds.

Overall, we believe the environmental  and social risks for Active Network are 
very low. In our view, the primary social risk is a potential hacking to disrupt 
services or illicitly obtain private data. While they have been diminished lately, 
we have seen instances of corporate websites taken down by hackers, typically 
using relatively simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. In most 
prior attacks, the websites and services were restored quickly (Sony is an 
exception), with no lasting effects on operations. Should Active Network fail to 
protect member privacy and prevent service disruptions, it could face legal 
implications and lose the confidence of both customer organizations and event 
participants. 

While it is minimal, as the company does not consume significant resources, the 
principal environmental issue related to Active Network is the consumption of 
electricity necessary to support its IT infrastructure. Actives dependence on 
energy to power its servers is also a pot ential risk if any type of outage occurs 
and disrupts the availability of its services/websites for its users. The company 
does not disclose any information re        lating to its CO2 emissions. Recently, 
activist shareholders of Amazon have voiced concerns over the companys 
consumption of raw materials and energy and insisted that it make public the 
environmental impact of its operations. However, these issues have had no 
implications for Amazon and we believe the risk to Active Network 
shareholders is also very low.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rati ng. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.
