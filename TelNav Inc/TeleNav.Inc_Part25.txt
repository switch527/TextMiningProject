    Highlights From the Conference Call

 Positive Notables
   TeleNav  expects  the  AT&T  agreement  to  auto-renew  in  March  2011.  Management  declined  to  elaborate  on  what  gives  them
    confidence that it will be auto-renewed, but when pressed on the conference call, management noted that they are in constant dialog
    with all of their carrier partners. We believe TeleNav has probably been given a wink and a nod by AT&T that they don't plan on
    canceling or renegotiating the contract at this time.
   Financial results were ahead of expectations. TeleNav beat our estimates and guidance for all key financial metrics.
   Management raised its outlook for fiscal 2011. The midpoint of 2011 revenue guidance was raised by 3.8% while the midpoint of
    net income guidance was raised over 29%. The company also raised gross margin guidance by 200 basis points. See Exhibits 2 and
    3, below, for a comparison of TeleNav's guidance to our estimates.
   Management guided to meaningful growth in "other" revenues segment. In the current quarter, "other" revenues represented over 5%
    of  total  revenues,  but  is  expected  to  represent  10%  exiting  the  fiscal  year.  Other  revenues  are  driven  by  automotive,  premium
    navigation services, and mobile advertising.
   On the call, management noted that the company is earning premium service revenues from Sprint customers for services such as
    premium navigation (with voice input) and weather/traffic alerts.

 Negative Notables
   While an auto-renew of the AT&T contract would be a positive for the company, the terms of the contract call for the renewal
    period  to  only  last  for  one  year  (at  which  point  it  would  be  up  for  renewal  again).  This  essentially  means  that  there  are  no
    renegotiation overhangs in 2011, but in 2012 we could see an AT&T renegotiation followed by a Sprint renegotiation later in the
    year.
   TeleNav did not announce any new carrier or automotive partnerships.
   Subscriber additions were less than forecast. TeleNav added 1.6 million new subscription customers, versus our estimate of 2.0
    million. Customer adds were flat quarter-over-quarter.

 Net Net
 TeleNav's results were better than expected and the updated 2011 guidance should result in numbers moving up across the street.
 However,  the  longer-term  risks  of  future  carrier  renegotiations  and  competition  from  other  (free)  navigation  services  remain.  We
 maintain our $6 target and Neutral rating.

 Changes to Our Model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by just over 5%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising
 GAAP EPS to $0.69 from $0.53.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
