       Price (USD)                 8.44US Cellular to offer bundled service
                                     Telenav announced this morning that they have signed up US Cellular as

                                     their fourth US carrier customer. US Cellular is the sixth largest US carrier,
       52-week range        9.80 - 7.85with 6.2  million subscribers. Importantly, they will offer Telenav as part of
       Market Cap (USDm)           480.2a bundled data plan. These plans attract higher subscriber numbers to Te-
                                     lenav service. Given the pattern at Sprint, we think the win today could start
       Shares outstanding (m)      56.9
                                     adding several hundred thousand subscribers to Telenav in coming quarters

       S&P 500 INDEX           1,070.25Modest financial positive, but important validation of bundled pricing
                                     We estimate the US Cellular service will add about a penny a quarter to
        
                                     earnings this year. We are not changing numbers today, but will factor this
       FYE 6/30  2009A2010E2011E     in when Telenav reports earnings on July 29th. While the impact is small,
       1Q EPS      0.02 0.02A  0.21  we think the US Cellular shift towards bundling should help to encourage
                                     other carriers to adopt this model.
       2Q EPS      0.02 0.16A  0.23
                                     We continue to see Telenav trending well, and at current levels the stock is
       3Q EPS      0.02 0.31A  0.23
                                     discounting the company's growth prospects. We reiterate our Buy rating.
