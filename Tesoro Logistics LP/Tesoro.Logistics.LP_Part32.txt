Company Description: 
Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
I. GP Sponsor Supports Growth From Acquisitions And Stability In Cash Flow 
 
Tesoro Corporation (TSO). TLLPs strategic relationship with its GP sponsor Tesoro Corporation enhances 
the partnerships growth prospects, in our view. TSO serv es as a strong partner to jointly pursue third-party 
acquisitions and as a source for potential drop-down ac  quisitions. TSO has a sizeable portfolio of logistics 
assets, which the partnership could acquire over time to augment distribution growth. As TLLPs largest 
customer, TSO also supports stability in the partnershi  ps cash flow through its long-term transportation, 
terminalling, and storage agreements with minimum volume commitments. 
 
Tesoro Corporation is one of the leading independent refining companies in the United States. The company 
operates seven refineries primarily located in the Western United States with total refining capacity of 664,500 
barrels (bbls) per day. In addition to refining assets,   the company has a network of  880 retail stations in 15 
states that sell transportati on fuels primarily under the  Tesoro, Shell, USA Gasoline, and  Mirastar brands. 
Founded in 1968, TSO was originally  focused on the exploration and produc tion of crude oil. In 1969, TLLP 
purchased its first refinery near Kenai, Alaska. During the 1990s, TSO began to focus on its petroleum and 
marketing businesses and sold non-core assets including its exploration and production operations. From 1998 
to 2002, TSO acquired refineries in Hawaii, Washingt  on, North Dakota, Utah, and California. In 2007, the 
company acquired the Los Angeles refinery and 278    Shell-branded retail stations from Shell Oil Products. 
During this ten-year period, TSO increased its total refining capacity to 664,500 bbls per day from 72,000 bbls 
per day. The company is now the second-largest independent refiner and marketer in the United States, with 
an enterprise value of approximately $5 billion. 
 
II. Investment Highlights 
 
    (1)  A Play On Infrastructure Development In The Bakken Shale 
     
We believe TLLP offers investors an  attractive way to participate in the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale 
infrastructure. Crude oil gathering revenue from this region (i.e., the High Plains System) is expected to 
account for 53% of the partnerships total revenue proj  ected for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012 (S-1 
guidance). There are several larger MLPs that are investing in the Bakken Shale, but their potential upside is 
less impactful, in our view, given the  relative size and geographic diversity of these partnerships. TLLP owns a 
crude oil gathering system tied to production from the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin. The High Plains System 
includes 700 miles of pipeline with the capacity to de liver up to 70,000 bbls per day to TSOs Mandan, North 
Dakota refinery and trucking operations that gather about 23,000 bbls per day of crude oil from the region.  
 
We anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the  Bakken Shale to be a driver  of organic growth for the 
partnership over time. TLLP already has committed to one project (i.e., an expansion of its High Plains System 
by Q2 2012 to accommodate the capacity addition at  TSOs Mandan refinery). The partnership has identified 
other potential opportunities that   have not been incorporated in it    s S-1 guidance. At this juncture, 
management has not quantified the potential amount of investments. For modeling purposes, we have 
assumed growth capex of $25 million   annually in 2012-16, which may prove to be conservative. TLLPs 
potential projects in the Bakken Shale include the following: 
 
    (1)  Expansion of the High Plains System through the co nstruction of additional gathering lines to access 
        new drilling locations. 
    (2)  To establish additional outlet connections between the High Plains System and third-party regional 
        pipelines, which would increase optionality for shippers and capture incremental third-party volume. 
        Management has identified five potential interconnections that it believes could be accomplished with 
        minimal capital: Enbridges pipelines at Ramburg,  North Dakota and Portal at the U.S./Canadian 
        border, and True Companies Bridger pipeline at Richey, Montana, Belle Fourche pipeline at Fritz, 
        North Dakota, and Little Missouri pipelines at Fryburg, North Dakota. 
    (3)  Increase High Plains Systems throughput capacity with additional pumping capacity. 
    (4)  Construction of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan  refinery to increase the Williston Basin takeaway 
        capacity for crude oil.

The Bakken Shale is one of the major emerging oil plays in North America. It is a key crude oil resource with 
approximately 4.0-6.3 billion bbls of recoverable reserv es (including the underlying Three Forks formation), 
according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral        Resources. This compares  with total U.S. proved 
reserves of 19.1 billion bbls. The Bakken play is a formation in the Williston Basin, which is spread across parts 
of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Canada. Development in the Bakken Shale has accelerated given 
the favorable crude oil price environment, advancements in drilling technologies, and E&P companies focus 
on liquids-rich areas due to more fa  vorable economics. Specifically, the rig count tied to the play in North 
Dakota has increased 130% year over year, to 128 rigs as of May 6, 2011, from 98 rigs in the comparable year 
ago period, according to the Land Rig Newsletter.      The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources 
forecasts that oil production in No rth Dakota could reach 450,000-700,0 00 bbls per day within the next 3-7 
years. For the U.S. portion of the  Williston Basin, crude oil production  could ramp up to 550,000-800,000 
bbls per day during the 2015-2020 time frame, according to the state agency. 
 
    (2)  Visible Multiyear Growth Outlook 
     
Current slate of organic growth projects provides visible/meaningful upside potential. TLLP has 
earmarked $15.5 million of growth capex over the next two years. Incrementa l cash flow from these projects is 
expected to result in an 18% year-over-year increase in EBITDA for the 12 months ending March 31, 2013. The 
sizeable increase is primarily attributable to the attrac tive returns from enhancing TLLPs existing assets (i.e., 
an EBITDA multiple of less than 2x) and the relatively small size of the partnership (percentage change is more 
meaningful off of a smaller base, all else being equal). 
 
As previously noted, TSO plans to   increase the capacity at its Mandan   refinery by 10,000 bbls per day to 
68,000 bbls per day by Q2 2012. TLLP plans to spend ab out $6.5 million to add pu mping, tankage, and truck 
unloading capacity to its High Plains System to support the Mandan refinery expansion. The partnership is 
also investing approximately $9 million to increase capacity and enhance its service capabilities at its terminals 
(e.g., ethanol blending, transmix). Specifically, TLLP is adding 8,000 bbls of storage capacity at Stockton by Q1 
2012 for $4.5 million, ethanol blending capabilities at Sa lt Lake City and Burley in H1 2012 for $2.4 million, 
and transmix receipt services at its Los Angeles terminal by Q1 2012 for $2.0 million.  
 
Modest distribution growth even absent acquisitions. According to our model, TLLP is well positioned 
to deliver a five-year distribution CAGR of 6.0%, assu   ming the $15.5 million of identified projects noted 
previously, $25 million of annual growth capex at an      average EBITDA multiple of 6.0x in 2012-16, no 
acquisitions, and a distribution covera  ge ratio of 1.1x. Alternatively, if we assume that TLLP undertakes  
$250 million ($50 million annually at an EBITDA mult       iple of 6.0x) of organic   growth initiatives and no 
acquisitions, this would increase our five-year distribution CAGR estimate to 7.9%, all else equal. 
 
Upside beyond organic growth could  potentially come from acquisitions.  We forecast a five-year 
distribution CAGR of 9.1% predicated on assumed acqu isitions of approximately $500 million in 2012-16 (or a 
$100 million transaction each year) completed at an EBITDA multiple of 10x and average annual growth capex 
of approximately $25 million during that period. Potential acquisitions will likely be a mix of drop-downs from 
TSO and third-party acquisitions, in our view. 
 
All else being equal, we forecast th at a $50 million increase or decrease  in our assumed acquisition spending 
estimate will increase or decrease our five-year distribution CAGR by roughly 1-2%, depending on the EBITDA 
multiple assumed (i.e., lowe r multiples imply higher gr owth leverage from acquis ition spending). Figure 1 
illustrates the sensitivity of our distribution growth fore cast to varying levels of  assumed acquisition spending 
and EBITDA multiples. Key assumptions used in this analysis are as follows: 
 
    •   Acquisition multiples in the range of 9-11x EBITDA.  
    •   Maintenance capex of approximately 9% of EBITDA, wh ich is in line with TLLPs guidance for the 12 
         months ending March 31, 2012. 
    •   Acquisitions in 2012 financed 100% with debt given that TLLP currently has only $50 million of debt 
         outstanding. We estimate 50% debt and 50% equity  financing thereafter. Finally, we assume a long-
         term average interest rate of 6.75% and yield of 6.25% for the equity portion of the financing.

Source:  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC estimates 
 
Drop-down of TSOs remaining logistics a           ssets could double the size of TLLP.    Based on an 
acquisition multiple of 10x EBITDA, we estimate a  pproximately $660-680 million  of immediate drop-down 
potential for TLLP. Management has not disclosed the earnings generated by TSOs remaining portfolio of 
midstream assets. However, it did note that the aggregate gross book value of TSOs retained logistics assets 
was $240 million as of December 31, 2010. This compares with the gross book value of $193 million for the 
assets currently in TLLP. Assuming that the relative gross book values are proportionate to cash flow, EBITDA 
of potential drop-down assets could approximate $66         million. Alternatively, we estimate EBITDA of  
$68 million for TSOs remaining portfo lio of midstream assets based on   the assets average throughput in 
2009 and 2010, estimated market-based rates, and margins in line with TLLPs S-1 guidance.  
 
Entitled to right of first offer fo r future TSO midstream divestitures.  For a period of ten years after 
its IPO, TLLP has a right of first offer to acquire certai n logistics assets if TSO decides to sell them. Potential 
drop-down assets include three terminals, two pipeli    nes, and five marine term    inals located in Alaska, 
California, and Washingt on. Having the right of first offer on subs  tantially all of TSOs potential midstream 
divestitures should mitigate competition with third part ies for future acquisition opportunities, which we view 
as a significant benefit for the partnership. 
 
(3)     TLLP Has A Relatively Low-Risk Business Model And Stable Cash Flow 
 
100% fee-based revenues with no direct commodity exposure.   TLLP derives 100% of its cash flow 
from fee-based, transportation, term inalling, and storage contracts with  limited volumetric risk. Essentially, 
the partnership receives a fee per unit (bbl) handled by its gathering system, terminals, pipelines, and/or 
storage assets. It does not take title to the product it  handles and has no direct exposure to the price of crude 
oil or refined products. Accordingly,   TLLPs cash flow should be relati  vely stable, in our view. While the 
partnership has no direct   commodity exposure, changes in commodity   prices can ultimately affect the 
partnerships volume. For example, if crude oil prices were to decline significantly, the development of the 
Bakken Shale could slow down. Consequently, a decrease in  producer drilling activity in the region could lower 
TLLPs future gathering throughput, thereby, decreasing cash flow. 
 
Long-term commercial agreements with TSO bolster stability of cash flow. TSO is the partnerships 
primary customer and accounted for 93% of TLLPs pro forma 2010 EBITDA. The company is expected to 
account for 97% of the partnerships revenue for the 12  months ending March 31, 2012, compared to 96% of 
pro forma 2010 revenue. Notably, TLLPs contracts wi  th TSO are long-term in nature. For the High Plains 
System, TLLP entered into a ten-year crude oil gath    ering and transportation agreement and a two-year 
trucking transportation services agreement with TSO, which is the primary shipper on the system. In addition, 
TLLP secured a ten-year services agreement for all eight of its terminals and ten-year transportation and 
storage contracts for its assets in Sa lt Lake City. All ten-year agreements  may be renewed for two additional 
five-year terms at TSOs option. The trucking contract  will automatically be extended for successive two-year 
terms, up to a maximum of ten years. These long-term agreements should provide the partnership with a 
reliable stream of cash flow into the future, in our view.

Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                                EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

Ten-year minimum volume commitments also  mitigate volatility of cash flow.   Unlike for many 
other midstream operators, TLLPs volumetric risk is limited through a minimum volume commitment feature 
in all of its agreements with TSO. Th is feature should mitigate the sensitiv ity of the partnerships cash flow to 
variability in throughput volume for the first ten year  s of the partnerships existence. Notably, management 
estimates that 84% of TLLPs projecte d revenue for the 12 months ending  March 31, 2012, is supported by its 
minimum volume commitments (i.e., $81.7 million out of $97.3 million). This implies that TLLPs distribution 
coverage ratio would approximate 0.73x (cash flow deficit of $11.4 million) if  the partnership realized only the 
minimum volume during that time frame and did not realize a commensurate decrease in operating expenses. 
 
Annual fee escalators should offset po tential inflationary cost pressures.  The High Plains pipeline 
rate is subject to the Federal Ener  gy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in dexing methodology. Based on the 
formula of PPI plus 2.65%, TLLP should benefit from a 6.8% rate increase in July 2011. TLLPs terminalling 
fees and Salt Lake City transportation  and storage fees are subject to auto matic annual escalators. This should 
help mitigate the impact of potential increases in the partnerships cost structure in the future. The fees are 
adjusted annually by a percentage equal to the change in the consumer price index. Alternatively, if 
management is successful in keeping expenses level, the  annual rate increases should result in modest margin 
growth, all else being equal.  
 
(4)     Conservative Capital Structure Provides Flexibility To Pursue Growth Objectives 
 
Strong balance sheet. With only $50 million of debt outstanding  and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0x, TLLP 
has the financial flexibility to pursue organic growth in itiatives and acquisitions, in  our view. The partnership 
has a $150 million revolving credit facility, which expire s in April 2014, with a $150 million accordion feature. 
This provides TLLP the option to me  aningfully increase its borrowing ca pacity in the future. TLLPs total 
liquidity of $100 million should be more than suffi     cient to finance its estimated 2011 growth capital 
expenditures of approximately $8 million. 
 
We believe that TLLP will maintain  a strong balance sheet and a relatively  conservative capital structure of 
50% debt and 50% equity over the long term. We foreca st that the partnership could end 2011 and 2012 with a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x and 2.6x, respectively. This  compares favorably to the median ratio of 4.0x for 
other small-cap pipeline MLPs. 
 
For 2012, we forecast that TLLP will spend $25 million     of growth capex. Our model also incorporates a  
$100 million acquisition assumption in Q1 financed with 100% debt. We forecast that the partnership could 
end 2012 with $76 million of liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x, which compares with the maximum 
permitted covenant threshold of 4.0x. 
 
IDR reset option enables management   to better control co st of capital.  Similar to other MLPs, 
TLLP has an IDR reset option in its partnership agreement. The reset option gives management better 
control of the partnerships cost of capital over the long term and allows TLLP to better compete for 
acquisitions and/or invest in orga nic projects that would otherwise not be accretive when the partnership 
becomes deep in the splits, in our view. As stipulated by the agreement, the general partner (TSO) holds the 
right to reset, at higher levels, the minimum quarterly distribution an  d incentive distribution levels. The 
cumulative cash flow accruing to the GP would not be     altered, but instead, the fu ture cash flow stream is 
affected. 
 
III. Overview Of TLLPs Assets  
 
TLLP owns and operates crude oil and refined product logistics assets. Specifically, the partnership owns crude 
oil gathering pipelines and a truck-ba sed crude oil gathering operation ti ed to production from the Bakken 
Shale/Williston Basin (i.e., the High Plains System). The system supplies crude oil to TSOs Mandan refinery in 
North Dakota. In addition, TLLP owns  and operates eight refined product  terminals with associated storage 
facilities located primarily in the Western United States, and five short-haul pipelines and storage assets in Salt 
Lake City, Utah. TLLPs terminalling assets are primarily  tied to TSOs refinery operations and play an integral 
role in helping TSO distribute refined products to market.

We expect TLLPs Crude Oil Gathering Segment (the High Plains System) to account for a significant portion 
of the partnerships cash flow (i.e., 56% of our pro   forma 2011 EBITDA forecast). For the 12 months ending 
March 31, 2012, management expects the segment to acco unt for approximately 53% of TLLPs total revenue. 
TSO plans to expand the capacity at its Mandan refine ry to 68,000 bbls per day from 58,000 bbls per day (i.e., 
a 17% increase in total refining capacity). Concurrently, TLLP plans to spend approximately $6-7 million of 
growth capex on its High Plains system to accommodate                 the expected capacity increase by Q2 2012. Excluding 
the impact of potential acquisitions, we believe that the partnerships gathering operations in the Bakken Shale 
will be the primary driver of growth in the near term (i.e., 58% of 2013 estimated EBITDA (excluding 
acquisitions), versus 56% of 2011E pro forma EBITDA). 
 
TLLPs Assets In The Bakken Shale 
 
Pipeline operations. Currently, TLLP operates approximately 700 miles of gathering and trunk lines tied to 
the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in North Dakota and                    Montana. The system also has access to Canadian 
crude oil through connections with third-party pipeline s. The partnership gathers crude oil (up to 70,000 bbls 
per day) for shipment to TSOs Mandan refinery in                  central North Dakota. TLLPs crude gathering system 
includes the following: 

           (1)  Approximately 143 miles of up to 6-inch injection lines in western North Dakota and eastern 
                Montana,  

           (2)  474 miles of up to 12-inch gathering and trunk lines in Montana and North Dakota, which lead to 
                TLLPs Dunn Center crude storage facility in North Dakota, and  

           (3)  Approximately 88 miles of 16-inch trunk lines,  which transport crude oi l from the Dunn Center 
                storage facility to TSOs Mandan refinery  

As shown in Figure 3, the High Plains System can re                 ceive crude oil at connection points with the Bridger 
pipeline (at Richey, Montana), Enbrid ges North Dakota System (at Rambur g, North Dakota), and Enbridges 
pipeline on the Canadian border (at Portal, North Dakota).  
 
TLLPs pipelines gathered an average of 50,695 bbls per day and 52,806 bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 
2009. Management estimates average pipeline volume of approximately 58,000 bbls per day for the 12 months 
ending March 31, 2012.

Trucking operations.  TLLP also utilizes trucks to gather crud  e oil from wells that are not connected to 
gathering pipelines. Local producers contact TLLP when they have crude oil  ready to be delivered onto TLLPs 
High Plains system. TLLP uses both proprietary and third-party trucks to gather crude oil from nearby wells or 
collection points and deliver onto TLLPs High Plains  system through one of the partnerships 13 proprietary 
truck unloading facilities. TLLPs trucking operation ga thered an average of 23,305 bbls per day and 22,963 
bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 2009. Management estimates that these trucks will gather 
approximately 22,900 bbls per day of crude oil for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.  
 
TLLPs Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage Segment 
 
TLLP also operates eight refined product terminals primarily located in the Western United States, with total 
terminalling capacity of 239,000 bbls per day and storage capacity of 1,627,000 bbls. The terminals are located 
in the states of California, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah,  and Washington. In Salt Lake City, the partnership also 
owns 13 refined product and crude oi             l storage tanks with 878,000 bbls            of capacity and five short-haul 
pipelines, which serve TSOs nearby refinery. 
 
Terminals.  TLLPs  terminals provide distribution, truck load                   ing, storage, inventory management, and 
blending services to its cust omers. The partnerships eight  terminals primarily receiv e refined products from 
pipelines connected to TSOs Los Angeles, Martinez, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. 
Revenue is generated largely from th  roughput fees for delivering refined product from TLLPs terminals to 
trucks and barges. TLLP also generates revenue from providing ancillary services such as blending, jet fuel 
filtering, and additive injections at certain terminals.

TLLPs terminals handle gasoline and gasoline blendstock s, 72% of 2010 volume, diesel fuel, 23%, and jet fuel, 
5%. TSO accounted for nearly all (i.e., 92%) of TLLPs   terminal volume in 2010. TLLP expects this figure to 
decrease over time as a result of its efforts to secure additional third-party volume. 
 
Salt Lake City storage facility and pipelines.  TLLP owns crude oil and refined product pipelines and an 
878,000 bbl storage facility, which excl  usively support TSOs 58,000 bbls   per day Salt Lake  City refinery. 
These assets were purchased by TSO in 2001 in connection                 with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City refinery 
from BP. TLLPs logistics assets facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products into and out of TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. Approximately 41% of the refine  rys yield is distributed vi a a third-party pipeline to 
TLLPs Burley and Boise Terminals. Further details of TLLPs Salt Lake City assets follow: 
 

          (1)  Crude oil and refined product storage. TLLP owns 13 crude oil and refined product storage 
                tanks with total shell capacity of 878,000 bbls.            The storage tanks are co nnected to TSOs Salt 
                Lake City refinery though four proprietary pipe lines. The crude oil stor age tanks supply the Salt 
                Lake City refinery, while the refined product st            orage tanks store the refinerys product yield 
                including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. 

          (2)  Crude oil pipelines. TLLP owns three crude oil pipelines (8, 10, and 16 inches), which are each 
                approximately two miles long. These pipelines tr              ansport crude oil from   a Chevron interstate 
                pipeline and Plains All Americans Pacific cr               ude oil pipeline to TLLPs storage facility. 
                Approximately 79% of the Salt Lake City refinery              s crude oil feedstock is delivered by TLLPs 
                short-haul crude oil pipelines.  

 
                                                                                                                                                               7

        (3)  Refined product pipelines.  TLLP also has two (6 and 8 inch) refined product pipelines, 
             which transport gasoline and diesel three miles from TSOs refinery to Chevrons Northwest 
             Pipeline.  
In 2010, TLLPs Salt Lake City pipe  line throughput averaged 60,666 bbls per day, versus an average of  
62,822 bbls per day in 2009, and the three-year averag  e of 64,126 bbls per day.  Management estimates an 
average throughput of 65,800 bbls per day for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012. 
 
IV. Risks 
 
Risks Specific To TLLP 
 
Customer concentration.  In 2010, TSO accounted for 96% of TLLPs total revenue and 92% of the 
partnerships terminalling throughput. Thus, a disruption  to TSOs refinery operations and/or a change in 
TSOs financial position could negatively affect the partnerships cash flow and future growth. 
 
Slower-than-forecasted drop-downs from TSO.    TLLPs distribution growth prospects are highly 
dependent on acquisitions from its GP sponsor, in our view. If there is a delay in the drop-down of assets to the 
partnership, TLLPs ability to grow could be slower than forecasted. 
 
Geographic concentration in Bakken Shale.  Currently, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from its 
operations in the Bakken Shale region. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2012, TLLPs crude oil gathering 
system in the Bakken Shale is expected to account for 53 % of total revenue. If TSOs Mandan refinery were to 
experience any disruptions for a prolonged period of     time, this could have a negative impact on the 
partnerships primary source of revenue. 
 
Lower refining margin. A decrease in TSOs refining margin could materially affect the amount of crude oil 
and refined products handled by TLLP. Margin could deteriorate if crude oil (feedstock) prices increase and/or 
refined product prices decrease due to lower demand (i.e., economic weakness, high unemployment, inventory 
levels, etc.). Weak refining margin could cause TSO to  reduce refined product production at its refineries, 
which could result in lower throughput volume for the MLPs assets. 
 
Declining production. The partnerships crude oil gathering volume is dependent on the production profiles 
of the Bakken Shale. Lower-than-expected production volume, inability to secure incremental volume to offset 
declining wells, or a decline in drilling activity due to   lower crude oil prices or rising costs could negatively 
affect future earnings and cash flow. 
 
Lower commodity prices.  While TLLP currently has no direct co  mmodity price risk, a majority of its 
revenue is tied to the exploration and production operations of producers in the Bakken Shale. Lower crude oil 
prices could have the potential to dramatically decrea se producers drilling activity and consequently, the 
partnerships throughput volume. 
 
Risks Applicable To All Energy MLPs 
 
Legislative risk. The potential for U.S. tax reform, which could result in the corporate taxation of pass-
through entities, is a risk for MLPs. Discussion around   carried interest, derivative legislation, and cap and 
trade could also result in headline legislative risk.  
 
Access to capital markets. MLPs are dependent on debt and equity markets to finance growth projects and 
acquisitions. A dislocation in either of these market   s could reduce a partnerships ability to increase 
distributions, as investments would become more expensive on the margin. 
 
A severe economic downturn.  Energy demand is closely linked to overall economic growth. A severe 
economic downturn could reduce the demand for energy and commodity products, which could result in lower 
earnings and cash flow. 
 
Interest rate risk.  As evidenced from the period 1998-99, ML  Ps have generally underperformed during 
periods of rapidly rising interest rates.  
 
Regulatory risk.  MLPs are regulated across a number of industries. TLLPs crude gathering assets are 
subject to state and Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) regu lations. Increased regulations and 
standards to address safety and environmental concerns could affect an MLPs ability to grow.

Environmental incidents and terrorism.  Many MLPs have assets that have been designated by the 
Department of Homeland Security as potential terrori                    st targets, such as pipelines and storage assets. A 
terrorist attack or environmental incident could disrup  t the operations of an MLP, which could negatively 
affect cash flow and earnings in the near term. 
 
V. Valuation 
 
Valuation -- $26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on a blend of (1) our thr ee-stage distribution discount model, which assumes an 
8.5% required rate of return and a long-term growth rate   of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow 
multiple of about 15x our 2012 estimate.  
 
Discounted Distribution Model (DDM) Model 
 
Our primary valuation tool is a three-stage distribution  discount model. Our model assumes a required rate of 
return of 8.5%. For our growth estima tes, we have assumed a  five-year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, a second-
stage growth rate of 2.5%, and a pe            rpetual growth rate of 1.25%. The reduction between our second and 
perpetual growth rate assumptions reflect the fact that   eventually 50% of incrementa l cash flow at TLLP will 
accrue to the general partner.  
 
Price-To-Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) 
 
We arrived at $26 per unit for the low end of our valuation range by applying a distributable cash flow multiple 
of about 15x to our 2012 distributable cash flow estimate. TLLP currently trades a price-to-2012E DCF multiple 
of 14.3x, versus 10.4x for small-cap pipeline MLPs. Distributable cash flow is defined as the cash available to be 
distributed to limited unit holders after payments ar               e made for maintenance capital expenditure and cash 
distributions to the general partner. 
 
TLLP Versus The Small-Cap Pipeline MLP Peer Group 
 
TLLP trades at a yield of 5.5%, an enterprise value (EV)-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 13.3x, and a 
price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 14.3x. In comparison, small-cap pipeline MLPs trade at a median yield of 
6.8%, an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 10.4x, and a price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 10.4x. 
Notably, on a price-to-DCF-to-growth basis (which is akin to a PEG ratio), TLLP trades at 1.2x, versus 2.1x for 
the peer group.  
 
The drop-down model has proven to be a successful strategy, as evidenced by the premium valuations 
afforded in the market for MLPs with this business mo  del. Investors seem willing to pay a premium for the 
visibility of future growth, in our  view. MLPs that have drop-down opportunities are not reliant on third-party 
acquisitions or on finding internal organic projects to  fuel growth. While the timing of drop-down acquisitions 
is not always certain, the market is clearly ascribing a certain value to the growth visibility afforded by having a 
parent company with significant MLP-able assets, in our view. In addition, we believe there is less 
integration risk with drop-down assets than with third-party acquisitions. 
 
Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (HEP) is a good compar                     able for TLLP, in our view, given its (1) strategic 
relationship with its GP sponsor Holly Corporation (H  OC), which is an independent petroleum refiner and

VI) Financial Overview And Model Assumptions 
 
Overview Of 2011 Estimates 
 
For 2011, we have forecasted pro forma EBITDA and DC F per unit of $52.0 million  and $1.46, respectively. 
Based on our distribution estimate of  $1.35 per unit, we forecast a coverage  ratio of 1.08x in 2011E (or excess 
cash flow of $3.4 million).  
 
Our 2011 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $12.4 million, which consists of the following: 
        o   Maintenance capex of $4.6 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        o   Growth capex of $7.8 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 79,967 bbls per day 
        o   Pipeline throughput of 51,137 bbls per day; 
        o   Trucking volume of 22,830 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 115,718 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 63,840 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls 
 
Overview Of 2012 Estimates 
 
We have assumed TLLP comp letes a $100 million acquisition at an EB ITDA multiple of 10x in Q1 2012E and 
invests $25 million in growth capex. We have forecasted EBITDA and DCF per unit of $68.1 million and $1.71, 
respectively. Based on our distribution estimate of $1.52 per unit, we forecast a coverage ratio of 1.13x in 2012E 
(or excess cash flow of $6.1 million). Our 2012 distribu tion forecast represents a 12.2% increase over our 2011 
distribution estimate. Excluding ou  r $100 million acquisition assumpti  ons, we estimate that TLLP will 
generate $58.1 million of EBITDA and DCF per unit of $1.60. 
 
Our 2012 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $131 million, which consists of the following: 
        o   Maintenance capex of $6.0 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        o   Growth capex of $25.0 million; 
        o   Assumed acquisition capex of $100 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 90,528 bbls per day 
        o   Pipeline throughput of 67,545 bbls per day  the projected 18% year-over-year increase reflects 
             the anticipated benefit of 2011-12 growth capex  and assumes no material change in pipeline 
             rates; 
        o   Trucking volumes of 22,983 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 124,192 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 68,243 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls
