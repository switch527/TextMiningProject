Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Q4 Takeaways 
 
     •    Activity levels in the Bakken Shale remain st             rong. In Q4, TLLP hand          led incremental volumes 
          primarily through third-party truck  carriers, which resulted in higher operating costs. Management 
          plans to increase the utilization of TLLPs proprietary trucking operations in Q1 and add to its fleet in 
          the spring to handle the anticipated ramp-up in vo              lumes. Managements target is to increase the 
          trucking mix to approximately 80-90% proprietar y/10-20% third party from  about 35% proprietary 
          in Q4 2011. 
 
     •    Management provided Q1 2012 EBITDA guidance of $14-15MM. Capex should approximate $8MM 
          including $1MM of maintenance capex. 
 
     •    TLLP plans to fund the Q2 dropdown of the Martinez  crude oil terminal with borrowings on its credit 
          facility. The partnership expects to expand the size            of its facility to $300MM concurrent with the 
          acquisition.  
 
Q4 2011 Results Modestly Below Our Forecast 
 
TLLP reported Q4 2011 EBITDA of $14.1MM versus our estimate of $15.6MM and consensus of $15.2MM. The 
slight variance from our forecast was primarily attributable to higher-than-expected operating and 
maintenance and G&A expenses (i.e. $13.7MM versus ou                  r estimate of $10.7MM). The impact of higher Q4 
expenses was partially offset by higher-than-anticipated revenue from both the crude oil gathering and 
terminalling segments (i.e. $27.8MM versus our esti  mate of $26.2MM). The partnership reported EPU of 
$0.37 versus our estimate and consensus of $0.40. 
 
Q4 DCF per unit was $0.40 versus our estimate of $0.44.  TLLP raised its distribution 3.6% sequentially to 
$0.3625 per unit, in line with our expectations. Q4 di             stribution coverage was 1.1x  (or excess cash flow of 
$1.3MM).

Crude oil gathering segment EBITDA was $6.6MM versus our estimate of $7.4MM. Q4 expenses were higher 
than anticipated due to repairs on the High Plains Pipeline and third-party trucking costs. However, revenue 
exceeded our expectations based on both stronger-than-anticipated pipeline throughput and average revenue 
per bbl. Q4 pipeline volumes averaged 60,064 bbls/d (versus our estimate of 59,530 bbls/d) and average 
pipeline revenue per bbl increased to $1.37 (versus our estimate and the Q3 rate of $1.35). Trucking volumes 
also exceeded our expectations and increased 13% sequentially to 27,007 bbls/d (versus our estimate of 23,879 
bbls/d).  
 
Terminalling, transportation and stor age segment EBITDA was $9.0MM, which was in line with our forecast. 
The impact of slightly higher-than-anticipated term            inalling volumes of 137,378 bbls/d (compared to our 
estimate of 134,852 bbls/d) and revenue per bbl of $0.79 (versus our estimate of $0.77) essentially offset the 
impact of slightly higher-than-forecast operating and maintenance expense in Q4.  
 
2013 EBITDA Guidance Reaffirmed--Dropdown/Projects Remain On Track 
 
Management continues to expect TLLP will generate $100MM of EBITDA in 2013, which is a meaningful 
increase from the partnerships current run rate of approximately $62MM. The anticipated improvement in 
cash flow is supported by contributions from approximately $100MM of identified organic growth investments 
scheduled to be placed in service in 2012-13. In general, the timing of and total capital expenditures remain 
unchanged from managements previous guidance communicated on December 5, 2011. However, we note that 
management increased the projected EBITDA associated with these investments to $42.5MM from $30MM 
due, in part, to higher anticipated volumes for the Stockton terminal storage and LA terminal permit 
expansion projects. We calculate an attractive average EB ITDA multiple of 2.4x for TLLPs portfolio of growth 
projects.

TLLPs 2013 EBITDA guidance also reflects an $8MM                benefit from the pending ac quisition of the Martinez 
crude oil marine terminal from its GP sponsor Tesoro  Corp (TSO). Management indicated that the drop-down 
remains on track to occur in early Q2 2012 but has not  disclosed the acquisition price. For modeling purposes, 
we are assuming an acquisition price of $75MM (or a 9.375x EBITDA multiple). 
  
Outlook For 2012 Unchanged--Introducing Our 2013 Forecast 
 
We are maintaining our 2012 DCF per unit and distribution per unit estimates of $2.09 and $1.61, respectively. 
TLLP should be able to deliver distribution growth of            16% year over year and generate a solid distribution 
coverage ratio of 1.3x. For 2012, we forecast TLLP wi ll generate EBITDA of $74.6MM, which represents a 29% 
($17MM) increase over proforma 2011 results. The anticipated year-over-year improvement is driven primarily

by contributions from the announced dropdown of the Ma                           rtinez terminal. Our foreca st also reflects partial 
year contributions from $22MM of growth projects scheduled to be placed in service during 2012. 
 
For 2013, we forecast EBITDA and DCF per unit of                         $109.9MM and $2.66, respectively. We estimate TLLP 
could deliver distribution growth of  24.3% in 2013 and generate a covera ge ratio of approximately 1.3x. Our 
2013 forecast is predicated on: (1) an assumed $100MM dropdown in Q1 2013 (at an EBITDA multiple of 10x), 
(2) a full-year benefit from $22MM of  growth projects to be completed in  2012, and (3) a partial-year benefit 
from $79MM of investments that are expected to be in service in 2013.

No Change To Our Valuation Range Of $35-37 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is predicated on a combination of   a dividend discount model and price-to-DCF multiple. 
Our DDM yields a valuation of $37 per unit, and assumes  a long-term distribution growth rate of 1.25%, and a 
required rate of return of 8.5%. The low-end of our va  luation range reflects a pric e-to-DCF multiple of about 
16.5x our 2012 DCF per unit estimate. Risks to TLLP                       trading in our valuation range include: a slower-than-
forecasted rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.
