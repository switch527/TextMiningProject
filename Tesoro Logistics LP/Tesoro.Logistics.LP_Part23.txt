                                                              coverage ratios would be 1.2x for both years.

                                        Executive Summary 
                                         
                                        We are initiating coverage of Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) with a Buy rating and a 
 
                                        $27.50 price target. Tesoro Logistics is a crude oil and refined products Master 
 
                                        Limited  Partnership  (MLP)  that  gathers,  transports,  and  stores  crude  oil  and 
 
                                        distributes, transports, and stores refined products. The partnerships assets consist 
 
                                        of a crude oil gathering system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area of North 
 
                                        Dakota  and  Montana,  eight  refined  products  terminals  in  the  Midwestern  and 

                                        Western United States, and a crude oil and refined products storage facility and 
                                        five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 
                                         
                                        Tesoros results are primarily driven by revenues generated from the gathering, 
                                        transporting, and storing of crude oil and refined products. The partnership does 
 
                                        not  generally  own  the  products  and  does  not  trade,  so  there  is  minimal  direct 
 
                                        commodity price exposure. The majority of its revenue is derived from Tesoro 
 
                                        Corporation under long-term, fee-based contracts that include minimum volume 
 
                                        commitments. 
 
                                         

                                        Tesoros growth should be driven by acquisitions and organic growth projects. 
                                        Growth spending should total approximately $18 million for 2011 and 2012. 
                                         
                                        As of December 31, 2010, the gross book value of the logistics assets that Tesoro 
                                        Corporation contributed to the partnership was approximately $193.0 million and 
 
                                        the gross book value of the company's retained logistics assets on which Tesoro 
 
                                        has a right of first offer was approximately $240.0 million.  
 
                                         
 
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
 
                                        $1.70/unit in 2013. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $1.87/unit for 

                                        2012 and $1.98/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.2x for both years. Our 
                                        estimates provide a 10.4% distribution growth rate in 2013.  
                                         
                                        Investment Thesis 
                                         
                                        We believe Tesoro is a good investment for several reasons, including: estimated 
                                        2013 distribution growth at 10.4%; our price target provides 18% upside from the 
                                        units current price; several avenues for growth, including dropdown acquisitions; 
                                        agreements with its parent that provide for minimum volume commitments; and it 
                                        should remain in the low distribution split levels over the near term. 
                                         
                                        We  believe  Tesoro  will  be  able  to  grow  its  operations  through  dropdown 
                                        acquisitions and benefit from Tesoro Corporations desire to expand its logistics 
                                        asset base. The partnership could also benefit from undertaking organic growth 
                                        projects and joint acquisitions with Tesoro Corporation. We believe Tesoro has 
                                        various opportunities for growth that should enable it to increase its distribution.

Tesoro Logistics LP                                                                                              October 13, 2011

                                         
                                        The majority of Tesoros revenue is derived from Tesoro Corporation under long-
                                        term, fee-based contracts that include minimum volume commitments. Under these 
                                        agreements, Tesoro will provide services to Tesoro Corporation and in turn will be 
                                        provided  with  minimum  monthly  throughput  volumes  of  crude  oil  and  refined 
                                        products.  Approximately  84%  of  Tesoros  revenue  is  derived  from  minimum 
                                        volume commitments.  
                                         
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
                                        $1.70/unit  in  2013.  Our  estimates  provide  a  10.4%  distribution  growth  rate  in 
                                        2013. This compares quite favorably to the 4.9% estimated average growth in 2013 
                                        for liquids-based partnerships under our coverage. 
                                         
                                        We do not forecast Tesoro entering the high distribution split levels until after 
                                        2015, given our current outlook for distribution increases. We view this as positive 
                                        for  the  partnership  as  it  facilitates  a  lower  cost  of  capital,  which  would  make 
                                        acquisitions  more  accretive,  all  things  being  equal.  If  Tesoro  were  to  make 
                                        acquisitions it would likely result in higher-than-forecasted distribution growth that 
                                        could push the distribution into the higher splits sooner.  
                                         
                                        Since Tesoros IPO in April, the units performance has led the liquids group. We 
                                        believe   the   outperformance   is   a   result   of   investors   anticipation   of   strong 
                                        distribution growth, which should lead to a solid total return. Although Tesoros 
                                        yield is lower than that of its peers, we believe the potential total return of Tesoro 
                                        makes for a compelling story.   
                                         
                                        Valuation Framework 
                                         
                                        We use a dividend (distribution) discount model to evaluate MLPs. We believe this 
                                        is the best approach as investors typically are drawn to the partnerships for the cash 
                                        flow. We use a two-stage model, estimating the partnerships distribution over the 
                                        next five years and then using a long-term growth rate. We then discount the cash 
                                        flows to derive the present value.  
                                         
                                        Our $27.50 price target for Tesoro is derived using a required rate of return of 
                                        8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91. 
                                        However,  since  the  model  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  assumptions  made  about 
                                        growth rates and discount rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis. We use 
                                        our forecast for distributions for the next five years, but use different required rates 
                                        of return and long-term growth rates to derive a series of values for Tesoros unit 
                                        price. We present our results in Figure 1.

                                              We estimate that Tesoros debt/EBITDA ratio will be 0.8x at year-end 2012, and it 

                                              should  remain  near  this  level  over  the  next  several  years.  EBITDA/interest  is 

                                              estimated at 25x at year-end 2012, and we forecast this ratio will increase over the 

                                              next  several  years.  The  partnership  only  has  $50  million  drawn  on  its  credit 

                                              facility,  resulting  in  the  strong  ratios.  As  Tesoro  undertakes  organic  capital 

                                              spending  and  potential  acquisitions,  the  partnership  is  likely  to  use  its  credit 

                                              facility as its first source of funding.  

                                               

                                              The partnership has a $150 million credit facility that expires in April 2014. Tesoro 

                                              can request that the maximum amount of the credit facility be increased up to $300 

                                              million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders.  

                                               

                                              The partnerships revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring Tesoro to 

                                              maintain a consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more 

                                              than 4.50 to 1.00 following acquisitions and not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 during 

                                              other times and an EBITDA to interest ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. The 

                                              partnerships target for leverage is a low 3x EBITDA multiple.  

                                               

                                              The  partnership  issued  guidance  for  expansion  capital  expenditures  of  $10.4 

                                              million for the 12 months ending March 2012, and maintenance capital of $4.6 

                                              million.  Since  the  original  guidance  was  issued,  Tesoro  has  announced  a  few 

                                              additional expansion projects. In our model, we forecast Tesoro will use its credit 

                                              facility to pay for its capital spending this year and next.

                                        Crude Oil Gathering 
                                         
                                        Tesoros  crude  oil  gathering  system  is  in  North  Dakota  and  Montana  and  is 
                                        referred to as the High Plains system. The system operates in the Williston Basin 
                                        and  includes  production  from  the  Bakken  Shale  region.  The  assets  include  an 
                                        approximate   23,000   barrels   per   day   (bpd)   truck-based   gathering   operation, 
                                        approximately  700  miles  of  pipeline,  and  storage  assets.  The  total  system  can 
                                        deliver up to 70,000 bpd to Tesoro Corporations Mandan refinery.  
                                         
                                        The  partnership and Tesoro  Corporation  have  a  10-year  pipeline transportation 
                                        services  agreement,  under  which  Tesoro  will  charge  Tesoro  Corporation  for 
                                        transporting crude oil on the High Plains pipeline system for shipments in North 
                                        Dakota. Tesoro Corporation will be obligated to transport an average of at least 
                                        49,000 bpd of crude oil per month at the committed rate.  
                                         
                                        Tesoro  also  expects  to  receive  revenue  from  shipments  above  the  minimum 
                                        volume  commitment  and  from  interstate  shipments.  Tesoro  Corporation  has 
                                        historically shipped volumes of crude oil in excess of the minimum throughput 
                                        commitment, and those excess shipments should continue. The partnership should 
                                        also derive revenue from other services.  
                                         
                                        The   partnership   and   Tesoro   Corporation   also   have   a   two-year   trucking 
                                        transportation  services  agreement  under  which Tesoro  will  provide  truck-based 
                                        crude oil gathering services to Tesoro Corporation. Under the agreement, Tesoro 
                                        Corporation will be obligated to pay a fee on a minimum volume of crude oil equal 
                                        to an average of 22,000 bpd per month.  
                                         
                                        Tesoro also expects to generate additional uncommitted transportation fees at the 
                                        same per-barrel rate for volumes in excess of Tesoro's minimum commitments. 
                                         
                                        Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage 
                                         
                                        Tesoro owns eight refined products terminals with total truck and barge delivery 
                                        capacity   of   approximately   229,000   bpd.   The   terminals   provide   distribution 
                                        primarily for refined products produced at Tesoro Corporation's refineries located 
                                        in Los Angeles and Martinez, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Kenai, Alaska; 
                                        Anacortes, Washington; and Mandan, North Dakota.  
                                         
                                        The partnership also owns a refined products and crude oil storage facility with 
                                        total shell capacity of approximately 878,000 barrels and three short-haul crude oil 
                                        supply pipelines and two short-haul refined product delivery pipelines connected to 
                                        third-party  interstate  pipelines.  These  assets  support  Tesoro  Corporations  Salt 
                                        Lake City refinery.

                                        Tesoro plans to pursue the following strategies:  
                                         
                                        •   Focus on Stable, Fee-Based Businesses. Tesoro will focus on providing fee-
                                            based  logistics  services  to  Tesoro  Corporation  and  third  parties  and  to

                                        •   Pursue Organic Growth Opportunities.  Tesoro will pursue expanding its asset 
                                            base   from   opportunities   that   may   arise   from   the   growth   of   Tesoro 
                                            Corporation's refining and marketing business or from increased third-party 
                                            activity.  These  opportunities  could  come  from  areas  that  complement  the 
                                            partnerships asset base or from new areas within its geographic footprint.

                                            acquisitions will be focused on logistics assets in the western half of the U.S.

                                            pursue  opportunities  to  add  volumes,  improve  operating  efficiencies,  and

                                                consisting of a dock with two vessel berths. 
                                                 
                                        The    partnership    could    pursue    third-party    acquisitions    under    the    right 
                                        circumstances, but we believe it is more likely that Tesoro will rely on organic 
                                        growth and dropdowns from its parent for growth.

                                        Distribution 
                                         
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
                                        $1.70/unit in 2013. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $1.87/unit for 
                                        2012 and $1.98/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.2x. Our estimates provide 
                                        a 10.4% growth rate in 2013. Management has stated that it is comfortable with a 
                                        coverage ratio of 1.1x.  
                                         
                                        We believe the partnership should be able to increase its distribution over the next 
                                        several years. Our estimates do not take into account any potential acquisitions and 
                                        reflects the partnerships guidance and CAPEX program for 2011 and 2012. As the 
                                        partnership continues with its growth program and if it were to make accretive 
                                        acquisitions, there should be room for further distribution growth.  
                                         
                                        Risks 
                                         
                                        The  partnership  and  all  MLPs  pass  through  taxes  to  unitholders,  giving  the 
                                        partnership  a  lower  cost  of  capital  relative  to  a  taxed  corporate  competitor. 
                                        Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest 
                                        risk to Tesoro and all MLPs.  
                                         
                                        The  partnership  is  dependent  on  volumes  running  through  its  infrastructure.  If 
                                        volumes   were   to   decline,   cash   flow   would   be   negatively   impacted.  The 
                                        transportation and processing of hydrocarbons are subject to environmental and 
                                        other regulations, and regulators  could  approve  more  stringent rules  that  could 
                                        increase the costs for companies in the energy industry.  
                                         
                                        The partnership is dependent on Tesoro Corporation for a substantially all of its 
                                        revenues.  Therefore,  if  Tesoro  Corporation  were  to  experience  a  significant 
                                        setback, the partnership could be negatively impacted. 
                                         
                                        One of the partnerships strategies is to acquire assets, with a focus on dropdowns 
                                        from its parent. If Tesoro Corporation does not sell midstream assets to Tesoro, the 
                                        partnership would be dependent on third-party acquisitions, which could be more 
                                        expensive and less accretive than dropdown assets.  
                                         
                                        A unitholder whose units are lent to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may 
                                        be viewed as having sold the units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping 
                                        their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short 
                                        seller should consider modifying any brokerage account agreements to prohibit 
                                        their  brokers  from  borrowing  their  units.  Because  of  the  nature  of  the  MLP 
                                        structure,  all  investors  should  consult  qualified  tax  counsel  before  making  an 
                                        investment in the sector.

                                        The  Williston  Basin  is  located  in  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Montana,  and 

                                        southern Canada. It extends approximately 475 miles from north to south and 300 

                                        miles from east to west. The basin became a major oil producer in the 1950s, when 

                                        large fields were discovered in North Dakota. Production peaked in 1986, but in 

                                        the early 2000s significant increases in production began because of horizontal 

                                        drilling techniques, especially in the Bakken Formation.

                                        In April 2008, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that the 

                                        Bakken  had  approximately  3.0-4.3  billion  barrels  of  technically  recoverable 

                                        reserves. The Bakken Formation estimate is larger than all other current USGS oil 

                                        assessments of the lower 48 states and is the largest continuous oil accumulation 

                                        ever assessed by the USGS. 

                                         

                                        According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority (NDPA), the rig count in North 

                                        Dakota has increased to 183 rigs as of July 2011 from 91 rigs as of December 

                                        2008. In addition, the NDPAs figures show that oil production from the Williston 

                                        has continued to increase over the last several years, with production averaging 

                                        414 thousand barrels per day (MBD) during the first quarter of 2011, compared 

                                        with 226 MBD during the first quarter of 2008.

n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.
