                    in Tesla - ALERT 

                    Tesla yesterday filed to do a follow-on equity offering that seems likely           Automobile Manufacture 
                    to raise about low-$200MM in proceeds.  The deal size is largely in line                                AC 
                                                                                                        Himanshu Patel, CFA
                    with our expectations (perhaps not as big as some may have worried). It is          (1-212) 622-3906 
                    encouraging to see CEO Musk and Daimler buy in the offering (Daimlers              himanshu.patel@jpmorgan.com 
                    goal was to not be diluted). Offering proceeds will be used primarily to            Vivek Aalok 
                    accelerate the commercial launch of Model X vehicle (crossover variant of           (1-212) 622-0798 
                    Model S), which is now expected to be  have customer deliveries in 4Q:13,           vivek.x.aalok@jpmorgan.com 
                    about 1.5 years after deliveries start for the Model S, also largely in line        Michael Kimlat 
                    with JPM expectations.                                                              (1-212) 622-0458 
                                                                                                        michael.x.kimlat@jpmorgan.com 
                    • Offering details:  TSLA is planning to sell 7.4MM shares, including               J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
                      private placements to the CEO and Daimler, and a potential 
                      overallotment to underwriters. 5.3MM shar es will be directly sold to the 
                      public, and underwriters will have       an option to buy an additional 
                      0.795MM shares. The CEO, Elon Musk, will purchase 1.5MM shares in 
                      a private placement (largely repurch  asing the shares he sold initially 
                      during the IPO)  his current 29.1% stake in TSLA is likely to be diluted 
                      only modestly (to ~28.5%). Daimlers investment arm, Blackstar 
                      Investco LLC, will maintain its owne rship stake (7.8%) in the company 
                      by purchasing an additional 0.577MM shares (0.6MM shares including 
                      overallotment). Daimlers choice to not  be diluted is a healthy vote of 
                      confidence in Teslas prospects and  in the two companies commercial 
                      ties. On the other hand, Toyota (with 3%+ stake in TSLA) and Panasonic 
                      (~1.5% stake) chose to not buy additio nal shares as part of this offering 
                      (as a result, their respective stakes will  be slightly diluted), but they are 
                      also not selling any of their existing shares. 

                    • Size of the offering not very surprising:       7.4MM shares sold at 
                      yesterdays close would hypothetically raise about ~$215MM gross, 
                      expected to be used to fund Model X development and likely some 
                      production shift capacity expansion. At a high level, the deal size would 
                      seem to reaffirm that the Model Xs engineering/development cost is 
                                                                                                          Please click below for our last note 
                      expected to be considerably l  ess than the Model Ss (~$150MM vs.                  discussing likelihood of equity 
                      ~$500MM), due to platform/powertrain sharing, and that the Model S is               offering: 
                      not incurring any material cost over-runs.                                          Tesla Motors: 1Q Revenue and

Initiated coverage Aug 09, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying
