                                     Key Investment Points 

TeleNav, Inc. (TNAV)                 TeleNav is a software-based provider of carrier-branded, turn-by-turn (TBT) 
                                     navigation and mobile search solutions, and as such, is poised to exploit a major 
Overweight 
                                     global growth opportunity arising from the convergence of GPS-enabled mobile 
                                     phones, smartphone operating systems, mobile internet access, and 3G wireless 
                                     networks. 

For more on TNAVs                   The addressable market for TBT navigation and mobile search is vast 
addressable market see Industry      By the end of 2010 there will be five billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide, 
Overview starting on page 16. 
                                     with over 324 million in North America and over 500 million in Western Europe, 
                                     two of the more developed wireless data markets. Wireless data revenues continue to 
                                     grow rapidly (~11% y/y in N. America) as subscribers increase their use of SMS 
                                     texting, email, internet access, navigation, and search, enabled by the availability of 
                                     inexpensive smartphones. In 2010, we expect over 360 million GPS-enabled 
                                     handsets (IDC) and 266 million smartphones (JPM estimate) to ship globally, mostly 
                                     pre-loaded with mobile navigation applications, or mobile storefronts from which 
                                     TBT applications can be downloaded. With the enablers in place, and growing 
                                     consumer awareness of TBT, subscriber growth is very strong. comScore estimates 
                                     TBT subscriber growth of 68% in Europe in 2009. TeleNav witnessed 91% y/y 
                                     subscriber growth in the quarter ended March 31, 2010. 

See page 20 for Gartners LBS        Location-based services (LBS)  an $8 billion market by 2012 
forecast, and page 20 for the        TBT navigation is a subset of location-based services, which should be a major 
JPM LBA market forecast. 
                                     growth market in the even broader context of the mobile internet. Gartner forecasts 
                                     LBS subscriber growth to be 46% through 2011, yielding nearly 300 million 
                                     subscribers by the end of 2012, and a revenue opportunity of just over $8 billion in 
                                     the same timeframe, a CAGR of 44%. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates 
                                     that the mobile Location-Based Advertising (LBA) market could top $18 billion 
                                     by 2015. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that mobile advertising will quadruple 
                                     from $414 million in 2009 to $1.6 billion in 2014. We believe TeleNavs application 
                                     portfolio will expand to exploit the broader LBS opportunity. 

                                     Wireless operators have a strong incentive to promote TBT navigation 
                                     Major wireless operators in N. America and Europe are pre-loading own-brand TBT 
                                     applications on smartphones and feature phones that they are introducing into the 
                                     market. The application is infrequently used and light on bandwidth, placing limited 
                                     stress on the network, but generates material incremental per subscriber data ARPU 
                                     when sold à la carte ($9.99/month at AT&T). Demand seems to be price elastic, so 
                                     when Sprint bundled TBT with a monthly data plan subscriber volumes grew 
                                     dramatically (now over 10 million, implying ~25% penetration of post-paid subs). 
                                     This could be strategically significant for the wireless operator, because the 
                                     application has personalization options that could make it sticky, a source of 
                                     customer loyalty, and the entry point to a broader swathe of carrier-oriented 
                                     applications associated with mobile internet, including mobile advertising and 
                                     mobile search. Essentially, TBT can defend the carrier from the threat of becoming a 
                                     dumb pipe. 

                                                                                                                        3 

                                                                                                                             342

About 10% penetration for            TeleNav is the leading provider of carrier-branded TBT navigation in North 
TeleNav TBT navigation at Sprint     America 
and AT&T. 
                                     TeleNav has more than 15 million subscribers, primarily on the Sprint and AT&T 
                                     networks, which represent a combined addressable market of about 130 million subs, 
                                     so penetration stands at about 10% (assumes 1-2 million subs on T-Mobile and other 
                                     networks). The companys TBT navigation application runs on more than 500 
                                     devices and on all major smartphone operating systems, both leadership positions. 
                                     The company has strong momentum as the OEM solution for Ford, running on the 
                                     Microsoft-powered SYNC platform, and is starting up operations with China Mobile, 
                                     the worlds largest operator. With over 800 engineers (more than half located in 
                                     China) and 10 patents (30 applications pending), TeleNav is a focused presence in 
                                     navigation and search, and is innovating quickly under the leadership of a strong 
                                     management team. The product platform, centered on TBT navigation, also includes 
                                     mobile resource management (MRM) solutions for businesses, auto OEM solutions, 
                                     social networking applications (e.g., Whereaboutz, Onmyway, Sipity), and location-
                                     based advertising. In our view, TeleNav is positioned to be a major participant in 
                                     LBS, navigation, and search on the mobile internet, competing with industry giants 
                                     that include Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. 

                                     There are multiple growth opportunities for TeleNav 
                                     We forecast a three-year revenue CAGR of 24% (through FY13), driven primarily by 
                                     a subscriber CAGR of 32% over the same period, offset in part by declining ARPUs 
                                     as TBT navigation is increasingly bundled. Subscriber growth should come from 
                                     deeper penetration of existing wireless accounts in the next two years, while we 
                                     expect revenues from China Mobile to be material by FY12. From near zero revenue 
                                     today, we look for Auto OEM solutions (initially Ford) to generate well over 5% of 
                                     revenue by the end of FY12, MRM to generate nearly 5% of revenue, and ad-based 
                                     revenues to represent 2-3% of overall revenue. There may also be a contiguous 
                                     opportunity to license or embed the TeleNav platform in social networking websites. 

We forecast $1.03 PF EPS in          The business model is already compelling 
CY10 and $0.94 in CY11 (higher       F3Q10 gross margins of 84% and EBITDA margins of 47% should decline, owing to 
share count). 
                                     bundling and increased investment, but we believe this low-capex, cash-generating 
                                     company should generate 70%-plus gross margins and EBITDA margins of over 
                                     34% even at the trough of the investment cycle. We believe free cash flow to equity 
                                     will steadily expand from about $34 million in FY11 to over $80 million in FY15, a 
                                     four-year CAGR of 26%, and EBITDA margins should climb to over 37% again as 
                                     the company begins to harvest some of the investment being made in the next year or 
                                     so. We believe TNAV can generate PF EPS of $1.03 in CY10 and $0.94 in CY11. 

See page 11 for analysis that        ARPU/Subscriber sensitivity analysis 
explores earnings sensitivity to     A key consideration for investors is the relationship between carrier pricing and 
subscriber and ARPU 
                                     subscriber adoption. To date the market has demonstrated strong positive price 
assumptions. 
                                     elasticity. By way of example, Sprint introduced bundling of TeleNav TBT in March 
                                     2008 when the blended ARPU stood at $3.85 and subscriber count was under one 
                                     million. A year later, the blended ARPU stood at $1.14 and the subscriber count had 
                                     jumped to nearly 8 million. Looking forward, we believe declining ARPUs will fuel 
                                     continued growth, but weigh on margins. On page 11, we include a sensitivity 
                                     analysis, which gives investors the ability to evaluate the estimated impact of 
                                     subscriber growth and ARPU decline on revenue, EBITDA and PF EPS. An 
                                     interactive version of this model is available on request.

                                     Investment Risks 

                                     Customer concentration risk 
                                     Sprint accounted for 54% of FY09 revenues, and the contract with TeleNav ends in 
                                     December 2011. In addition, we estimate Sprint accounts for nearly 12 million 
                                     TNAV subscribers today and TeleNav is approaching 25% penetration of the post-
                                     paid market at that account, so aside from the contract rollover risk, there is also a 
                                     risk that growth at Sprint slows soon. AT&T accounted for 27.5% of FY09 revenue 
                                     and we expect revenue growth at AT&T to be higher than at Sprint, especially if the 
                                     operator begins to introduce bundling. The AT&T contract expires in March 2011.

can be contained. 
                                     October 2009, and has since launched the free application in N. America and most of 
                                     Europe. In January 2010, Nokia announced the availability of free navigation with 
                                     Ovi Maps for use on S60 and Maemo smartphone platforms, which are widely used 
                                     in Europe. In May 2010, Microsoft announced that free navigation would be 
                                     available later in 2010 on devices running Windows Mobile 6.0 (and higher). Apple 
                                     offers free maps and driving instructions, and a variety of TBT solutions are 
                                     available for the iPhone and the iPad via the webstore. Free navigation is a serious 
                                     threat to TeleNav, and these large companies are able to subsidize these initiatives 
                                     indefinitely in a manner that TNAV cannot. 

                                     TeleNavs business model could change dramatically, with the onset of ad-based 
                                     navigation and search 
                                     Free navigation will be increasingly supported by ad-based revenues. J.P. Morgan 
                                     analyst Rod Hall estimates the LBA market could exceed $18 billion by 2015. 
                                     PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts a four-fold increase in global mobile advertising, 
                                     from $414 million in 2009 to $1.6 billion in 2014. TeleNav recognizes that the 
                                     paid navigation market (subscription based, or bundled) may not be sustainable 
                                     long term, to the extent that consumers are accepting of the placement of adverts and 
                                     coupons on their phones (some may want to pay a premium for TBT navigation 
                                     without the clutter). 

For how the business model           Bundling and free navigation weigh on the business model in excess of our 
could change with lower ARPUs,       expectations 
please refer to Sensitivity 
                                     We expect TNAVs ARPUs to decline about 8% y/y in FY11 to $0.95, stabilize in 
Analysis, on page 11. 
                                     FY12 (owing to a higher proportion of revenue from AT&T), and then decline 
                                     slowly for the indefinite future, primarily owing to the wireless operators 
                                     transitioning to bundling and ad-based navigation and search. We expect gross 
                                     margins to decline from a peak of 84% in F3Q10 to under 70% by FY15, and for 
                                     EBITDA margins to decline from about 47% today to about 35% in FY11. There 
                                     could be downside to the ARPUs and margins owing to competition and more rapid 
                                     adoption of bundling (e.g., by AT&T), though the latter could also buoy subscriber 
                                     and revenue growth ahead of expectations. 

                                     Growth initiatives are somewhat opaque and risky 
                                     TNAV is engaged in some speculative software development (e.g., Whereaboutz, 
                                     OnMyWay) in pursuit of new markets that might not develop (e.g., LBS features in 
                                     social networking sites). We believe TNAV may make acquisitions in Europe to 
                                     accelerate growth. The company is delivering solutions to a modest number of very 
                                     large customers that have purchasing power and potentially the ability to stifle

                                    contract announcements and news flow for competitive reasons, so the intra-quarter 
                                    information flow for TNAV could be modest. There are no good pure-play comps for 
                                    TNAV, and the resulting information vacuum could lead to considerable intra-
                                    quarter stock volatility. 

                                    Company Description 
                                    TeleNav is a software-based provider of carrier-branded, location-based applications 
                                    delivered to GPS-enabled mobile devices, principally smartphones. TNAV consumer 
                                    applications include turn-by-turn navigation (voice and screen instructions), maps, 
                                    local search, and social networking. Enterprise solutions (MRM) include tools for 
                                    monitoring the location of vehicles and other assets and for optimizing a mobile 
                                    workforce. 

                                    TeleNav has ~14.5 million subscribers with 15 wireless carrier partners in 29 
                                    countries and covers more than 500 phone models and all major mobile OSs. The 
                                    companys product portfolio includes Mobile Navigation, In-Dash Navigation, 
                                    Enterprise LBS, and Mobile Advertising/Commerce. TeleNav was founded in 1999 
                                    and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California with a significant presence in China 
                                    and additional offices in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, and the U.K. As of March 31, 
                                    2009, the company had 878 employees of which 670 were in functions related to 
                                    R&D, with 331 in the U.S and 541 in China. 

                                    TeleNav began trading on the Nasdaq on May 13, 2010, under the ticker symbol 
                                    TNAV. 

                                    Earnings Overview 

                                    We forecast CY10 PF EPS of $1.03, PF EBITDA of $78.5mm, and revenue of 
                                    $191.5mm. 

                                    We forecast CY11 PF EPS of $0.94, PF EBITDA of $84.7mm, and revenue of 
                                    $234.1mm. 

                                    We forecast CY12 PF EPS of $1.13, PF EBITDA of $104.6mm, and revenue of 
                                    $289.5mm. 

                                    We look for TNAV to grow PF EBITDA at a CAGR of about 17% over the next 
                                    five years on a revenue CAGR of 22%. The loss of leverage relates to lower 
                                    ARPUs and gross margins originating from increased bundling of TBT navigation, 
                                    and a nearer-term investment phase that positions the company for longer-term 
                                    growth in the mobile internet. 

                                    Demand for TeleNav TBT seems to be price elastic. We think this is an important 
                                    consideration for investors. We note that in September 2007 ARPU was about $5.15 
                                    and TNAV reported less than 500,000 subscribers. Growth accelerated in June 2008 
                                    when Sprint started to bundle TeleNav as part of the Simply Everything plan, and by 
                                    December 2008, the total subscriber count approached six million. We believe 
                                    bundling by AT&T could have a similar effect, however there is no guarantee that 
                                    the price-elastic relationship will endure.

                                                                                                                          345

                                        We expect TNAV to report 4QFY10 PF EPS of $0.28, PF EBITDA of $21.5 million, 
                                        and revenue of $46.9 million. We look for FY11 guidance to align with our 
                                        expectations: FY11E PF EPS of $0.86, PF EBITDA of $74.7 million, and sales of 
                                        $210.1mm. 

                                        Revenue Outlook 

                                        Currently, nearly all of TNAVs revenues relate to consumer TBT subscribers at 
                                        Sprint and AT&T (90% of FY09 revenue). 96% of FY09 revenue originated in the 
                                        U.S. We believe MRM and Auto OEM revenues currently represent less than 3% of 
                                        total revenue. The subscription revenues are recurring in nature and the company has 
                                        good visibility into current quarter activity owing to real-time reporting of 
                                        activations.

                                        Contracts govern the carrier relationships. The Sprint contract extends through 
                                        December 2011 and the AT&T contract through March 2011. We expect both 
                                        contracts to be rolled over. Alltel is of declining significance to TeleNav (migrating 
                                        to Verizon systems). The Bell Mobility contract extends to June 2011; Rogers and  
                                        T-Mobile (U.S.) are three-month rolling contracts. 

                                        We expect TBT subscription revenue growth of approximately 49% in FY10, 25% in 
                                        FY11, and 37% in FY12. Subscription revenue growth should be fueled by rapid 
                                        adoption by subscribers, nearly 64% in FY10, 13.5% in FY11, and nearly 17% in 
                                        FY12; however, this should be offset by declining ARPUs through mid-FY11 owing 
                                        to increased bundling at Sprint. We expect a temporary rise in ARPUs in late FY11 
                                        owing to higher relative growth of monthly recurring charge (MRC) customers at 
                                        AT&T, but for the ARPU decline to resume in FY12 as AT&T turns to bundling and 
                                        other carriers in Asia (China Mobile) and Latin America (Vivo, Telcel) come on 
                                        board.

                                         potential to introduce similar solutions into other auto OEMs in the next year or two. 
                                         Regarding MRM, we believe TeleNav, in partnership with its telecom partners, will 
                                         more aggressively market its enterprise solutions next year, and build a more focused 
                                         direct sales team. Location-based advertising is likely to be a modest contributor to 
                                         growth in the FY10-FY12 timeframe.

                                      Earnings Outlook 
                                      Gross, operating, and EBITDA margins will likely plunge in FY11-FY12 before 
                                      recovering in FY13. This should originate in declining ARPUs, which will weigh on 
                                      gross margins. 70% of subscriber COGS is largely represented by licensing fees and 
                                      they increase with usage (which is increasing). About 30% of costs are fixed and 
                                      relate to data center and customer support operations, so there could be some longer-
                                      term leverage here. We do not expect gross margins to return to the peak 84% level 
                                      seen in FY10. 

                                      Operating and EBITDA margins should also decline largely as a result of the 
                                      pressure on gross margins. In addition, the company is investing heavily in new 
                                      products and services (R&D is expected increase over 70% in FY10 and over 40% in 
                                      FY11) and to support carriers in new geographies (more than 50% of the engineers 
                                      are located in China), and there is a significant increase in G&A (public company 
                                      costs) in FY10.

                                      Longer term, we believe EBITDA margins will trough at about 35%, and then 
                                      expand to about 37% through FY15 as the company scales growth with its newer 
                                      carrier partners and new products & services. 

                                      PF net income is forecast to decline in FY11 to $39.7 million from $43.6 million in 
                                      FY10, primarily due to a 10% decrease in EBITDA margins, but also due to a higher 
                                      tax rate (about 200bp). We estimate PF EPS of $0.86 will represent a decline of 
                                      about 23% in FY11 owing to lower margins, a higher tax rate, and a significant 20% 
                                      increase in the weighted average share count. 

                                      We expect PF net income to grow about 24% in FY12 as the company scales. We 
                                      look for FY12 PF EPS of $1.04, marking a 21% y/y increase. 

                                      Note that TeleNav carries negligible inventory, and that capital expenditure 
                                      (primarily relating to data center operations and office equipment) is modest at about 
                                      $10 million per year. The company does capitalize major software projects but the 
                                      amount capitalized to date is negligible. Non-cash stock compensation, currently 
                                      running at about $5 million per annum, normalized, is a consideration when 
                                      calculating pro forma earnings.

                                                                 will generate strong cash flows  over $30 million in FY11 and over $40 million in

                                                                 TNAV is collecting cash from a small number of very sizable telecommunications 
                                                                 operators that represent very modest credit risks, in our view.

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     We are initiating coverage of TNAV with an Overweight rating, meaning that we 
                                     expect the stock to outperform the mean of our coverage universe over the next 6-12 
                                     months. At a closing price of $8.45 on June 21, TNAV is trading at 9.0 times CY11E 
                                     PF EPS of $0.94, which is a 49% discount to the mean of our coverage universe. We 
                                     believe this discount reflects investors concerns relating to declining ARPUs and 
                                     margins, the competitive threat from Nokia and Google, and the risks associated with 
                                     an early-stage company that has just gone public. We believe the stock is 
                                     substantially de-risked at this level and technology investors are presented with a 
                                     very intriguing GARP stock. 

                                     Execution should earn higher multiple in time. We take the view that TNAV is a 
                                     category-defining SaaS company, and can earn multiples that are comparable with 
                                     high-growth companies in that software category; however, in the context of near-
                                     term declining ARPUs and margins, competitive threats, and business model risk, we 
                                     believe this is a stretch as of today. TNAV needs to earn a higher multiple through 
                                     execution. We believe investors need to see evidence of continued adoption of 
                                     carrier-branded TBT navigation. 

                                     Taking a more conservative stance, we believe TNAV can be compared to 
                                     software-based companies that are focused on the telecommunications industry, 
                                     which include companies such as Amdocs, Neustar, and Synchronoss. The median 
                                     multiples for this category of companies are 11.5 times CY11E P/E and 5.9 times 
                                     CY11E EV/EBITDA. Using these multiples yields a valuation range of $10.80 (P/E 
                                     basis) to $13.50 (EV/EBITDA). We think this valuation range is conservative for 
                                     several reasons: 1) the comp group does not exhibit as strong a growth outlook as 
                                     TNAV, 2) we believe (higher) CY12 earnings will be a consideration for investors 
                                     soon, and 3) we believe the company can be awarded a SaaS-like multiple with good 
                                     execution over the next several quarters. 

                                     Our December 31, 2010 price target is $13.50 based on an assigned multiple of 
                                     6 times CY11E PF EBITDA of $84.7 million; the multiple is based on the comms 
                                     software/services peer group multiple. The market cap takes into consideration 
                                     $115mm of cash post IPO, and assumes zero debt. We use a post-IPO share count of 
                                     46 million shares to calculate our per-share price target.

                                             Industry Overview 

                                             TeleNav is a leading provider of software and services used to power carrier-
                                             branded TBT navigation and mobile search solutions in North America and 
                                             internationally. TBT and mobile search are early-stage examples of LBS, which will 
                                             expand to include mobile resource management (MRM), LBA, mobile social 
                                             networking applications, mobile commerce, and other applications and services. 

                                             TBT navigation goes mainstream with cheap smartphones. TBT navigation is 
                                             made possible by the convergence of digital maps, vectorized geographic 
                                             information, network-assisted global positioning systems (GPS), high-speed wireless 
                                             networks, wireless data infrastructure, and the availability of inexpensive feature 
                                             phones and smartphones that support multi-tasking applications. 

                                             TeleNav is a leader in TBT navigation. There are multiple participants in the 
                                             mobile navigation value chain, but TeleNav has emerged as a leading participant in 
                                             the emergent space, powering the Sprint Navigator and AT&T Navigation 
                                             applications, Fords SYNC TBT solution, as well as MRM solutions for use by 
                                             business customers.

                                                  Much of the growth in wireless data is driven by smartphone shipments, for 
                                                  which wireless data plan attach rates are close to 100%. Smartphones, many priced at 
                                                  under $200, now feature powerful CPUs, gigabytes of memory, 3G broadband data 
                                                  transmission capabilities, large-format touch screens, and flexible operating systems

                                         MRM revenues could reach $1 billion by 2014. MRM represents a contiguous 
                                         LBS market that TeleNav is poised to pursue, directly and via the wireless carrier 
                                         channel. TNAV already has more than 9,000 small to medium-sized business 
                                         customers of the TeleNav Track service, partnering with AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon; 
                                         however, the revenue contribution is currently modest. 

                                         Frost & Sullivan pegs the MRM market as a $973 million market opportunity by 
                                         2014, and defines MRM as incorporating both handset-based and in-vehicle 
                                         technology that uses wireless and location technologies to locate, track, and manage 
                                         mobile workers, tasks, and assets.

                                         TBT OEM solutions for 30 million auto OEMs a year also a possibility. 
                                         Approximately 30 million passenger vehicles ship in North America and Europe 
                                         each year, normalized for the economic cycle. We are seeing evidence of increased 
                                         adoption of TBT navigation solutions in the driver dashboard. GM Onstar was an 
                                         early provider of concierge-type solutions and the solution will soon be enhanced by 
                                         the inclusion of Google TBT (service will be called eNav). This puts GM into a 
                                         more competitive position versus Ford, which introduced TBT navigation (powered 
                                         by TeleNav) into their SYNC platform and is making it available on all 2010/2011 
                                         Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Luxury automobiles, such as Mercedes and BMW, also 
                                         come with an in-cockpit concierge service, which includes TBT navigation (powered 
                                         by ATX Group). We believe TBT will prevail as an OEM solution over in-dash PND 
                                         solutions, owing to the ability to provide off-board real-time data, and because 
                                         voice interaction reduces driver distraction. 

                                         We believe, in time, all vehicles will come equipped with TBT navigation, or a 
                                         console system that supports it as an option, implying an annual addressable market 
                                         of 30 million (passenger) vehicles in N. America and Europe, alone.

                                             Multiple growth opportunities. Looking forward, we believe growth will be 
                                             centered on 1) deepening penetration of existing carrier subscriber populations (e.g., 
                                             Sprint, AT&T), 2) expanding geographic footprint (China, South & Central America, 
                                             Europe), 3) expanding into contiguous markets (MRM, Auto OEM, Enterprise 
                                             solutions, Social Networking), and 4) location-based advertising.

                                        TeleNav provides off-board navigation, meaning that the maps, navigation 
                                        instructions, and POI information is provided in real time over the air, from a 
                                        datacenter. The information is constantly refreshed (unlike a PND) and the 
                                        application can be continuously upgraded. The application, or software as a service 
                                        (SaaS), is hosted in the TeleNav Data Center. Building blocks of the application 
                                        include a LBS Platform (which enables the routing of relevant information to the 
                                        user based on XY coordinates, in the appropriate format), voice recognition software, 
                                        authentication and billing systems, and an ad publishing platform. Source 
                                        information includes GIS data, principally from TeleAtlas and Navteq, POI 
                                        information from multiple third-party sources, and local advertisements provided by 
                                        ad networks such as CitySearch, Yelp, or direct from advertisers (e.g., Best Western).

                                        We see LBA as a natural extension of mobile navigation and mobile search, and we 
                                        believe TeleNav is well positioned to pursue this opportunity, competing effectively 
                                        against much larger companies, such as Google and Nokia. Aside from the fact that 
                                        TeleNav already has the ability to reach 15 million subscribers, the companys 
                                        platform can be (and is being) extended to incorporate and deliver paid-positioning 
                                        (on search), coupons, and mobile banner ads. Importantly, we believe TeleNav is 
                                        able to implement ad-based search in a manner that does not undermine the wireless 
                                        operators relationship with the subscriber, and which yields revenue share to the 
                                        wireless operator. 

                                        We believe TeleNav is positioned to realize $0.20-$0.50 per billable event. The 
                                        revenue-share model will favor TeleNav or the operator depending on who sourced 
                                        the advertiser.

                                          Competition 

                                          Telecommunications Systems (acquirer of Networks in Motion) is TeleNavs closest 
                                          direct competitor, as a white-label TBT navigation solution provider (for Verizon). 

                                          TeleNav is also now competing with free navigation solutions from Nokia and 
                                          Google (Google Experience versions of the Android platform). Microsoft has also 
                                          announced its intention to offer free turn-by-turn navigation on Version 6.0 and 
                                          higher of Windows Mobile. 

                                          Free navigation is a threat, but it can be contained. We believe TeleNav is well 
                                          positioned to defend against the threat of free navigation, primarily because of its 
                                          close partnership with the wireless operators. First, wireless operators still control 
                                          which applications will be pre-provisioned on the majority of handsets, including a 
                                          subset of Android handsets. Second, its worth remembering that Android and Nokia 
                                          represented less than 15% of all smartphone sales in 1Q10 in N. America; Samsung, 
                                          LG, HTC, Blackberry, Motorola, Palm, and others are important suppliers and often 
                                          deliver product that aligns with the carrier specifications. Third, we believe wireless 
                                          operators will increasingly move to bundling TBT navigation, and as such, it is 
                                          perceived to be free by consumers. Finally, owing to a strong R&D presence in 
                                          China, we believe TNAV has a significant advantage in that nascent market. Finally, 
                                          TeleNav is introducing its own ad-based navigation capabilities, competing head on 
                                          with industry giants, not only in TBT navigation but also in the broader mobile 
                                          search category. 

                                          TeleNav competes with on-board navigation from the PND vendors, such as 
                                          Garmin, TomTom, and Mio. Garmin and TomTom have developed applications that 
                                          can run on mobile phones too. We believe the PND market will plateau and decline 
                                          as consumer adoption of TBT navigation on mobile phones expands. Off-board 
                                          navigation provides real-time information, applications can be updated regularly, and 
                                          provides reach into a deeper database of information, and is always on, always 
                                          available being on the consumers ever-present mobile phone. 

                                          There are a number of smaller companies that are also in the TBT Navigation space, 
                                          including Telmap, Jentro, Appello Systems, ALK Technologies, and Route 66. 

                                          In MRM, TeleNav is competing against Trimble, Qualcomm, and other enterprise-
                                          grade solutions companies. 

                                                                                                                                    27

                                       Management 
                                       We have been monitoring TeleNavs progress for nearly ten years and we are 
                                       tremendously impressed by H.P. Jin, the CEO, who took this company from a very 
                                       early-stage venture through to a company that occupies a leadership position in the 
                                       nascent LBS industry, employing over 800 staff, and which partners with some of the 
                                       most demanding customers in the world of telecommunications and technology. We 
                                       think the company is run in a prudent manner, but has a very strong culture of 
                                       innovation, which we think is unique. Dr. Jin has also established a global 
                                       organization from the get-go. 

                                       Mr. Miller, the CFO, has impressed us with his steady piloting of the IPO process. 
                                       Thus far (pre-IPO), the companys results have matched or beaten expectations, and 
                                       we believe Mr. Miller has a good handle on how to communicate with the Street. 
                                       Both Mr. Jin and Mr. Miller believe execution is key.

                                       the board of directors since October 1999. Dr. Jin has also served as TeleNavs chief 
                                       executive officer and chairman of the board of directors from October 1999 to May 
                                       2001 and since December 2001. Prior to TeleNav, Dr. Jin served as a senior strategy 
                                       consultant at the McKenna Group and as a business and strategy consultant at 
                                       McKinsey & Company, management consulting firms. Dr. Jin was also previously a 
                                       technical director at Loral Integrated Navigation Communication Satellite Systems, 
                                       or LINCSS, a division of Loral Space & Communications, Inc., a GPS service and 
                                       engineering company. Dr. Jin holds a B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from

                                      GIS 
                                      A geographic information system (GIS) captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and 
                                      presents data that refers to or is linked to location. 

                                      GSM Localization 
                                      It is the use of multilateration to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, 
                                      usually with the intent to locate the user. 

                                      GUI 
                                      Graphical User Interface is the software interface between user and hardware of any 
                                      electronic device. A GUI offers graphical icons, and visual indicators, as opposed to 
                                      text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation to fully represent the 
                                      information and actions available to a user. 

                                      GEOINT 
                                      GEOINT stands for GEOspatial INTelligence, which is an intelligence discipline 
                                      comprising the exploitation and analysis of satellite information to describe, assess, 
                                      and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the 
                                      Earth. 

                                      GPS 
                                      GPS is Global Positioning System which is a technology that gives the position of 
                                      any object with attached GPS receiver on the globe. It uses four satellites from a 
                                      constellation of 24 to 32 satellites (launched by the U.S.) to precisely locate the GPS

                                      accessible with mobile devices through the mobile network and utilizing the ability 
                                      to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device. LBS can include 
                                      mobile commerce when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at 
                                      customers based on their current location. They include personalized weather 
                                      services and even location-based games. 

                                      LBA 
                                      Location-based advertising relates to ad revenues that originate in knowing the 
                                      location of the consumer and using that information to provide context-sensitive 
                                      promotions, coupons, or other material that drives business to the advertiser.

                                      Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) is the region of space around the Earth above Low Earth 
                                      Orbit (altitude of 2,000 kms) and below geostationary orbit (altitude of 35,786 kms). 
                                      The most common use for satellites in this region is for navigation, such as GPS 
                                      (with an altitude of 20,200 kms).

This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst may or may not have covered it
over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
