                  Whats New: TEA reported 33% 4Q earnings growth                 Shr price, close (Mar 26, 2012)               $20.66
                  with $0.32 EPS, beating MSe $0.30 and cons $0.31. 4Q            Mkt cap, curr (mm)                             $788
                  sales grew 33.6% to $68.4B vs. MSe $66.8M (+1c) and             52-Week Range                            $29.35-14.28
                  cons $67.6M. Comps (excl. e-com) increased 4.4% vs. 
                  MSe 3.0%. Gross margins were lower than expected at 
                  65.6% vs. MSe 66.8% (-1c), offset by better SGA of 
                  32.2% vs. our 33.9% (+2c) resulting in operating margin 
                  80bps higher than MSe 30.2%. 

                  While earnings growth remains intact, we are 
                  watching store transaction trends. 4Q same store 
                  transactions (excluding e-commerce and beverage only) 
                  of +1.6% reversed recent negative trends (-1.8% in 
                  2Q11 and -2.5% in 3Q11). We would like to see this 
                  continue given that TEA is in the early stage of growth 
                  and should be rapidly acquiring new customers. 

                  Store openings drive growth. Tracking ahead of 
                  schedule, TEA ended the year with 200 stores and 
                  announced plans to increase store count 30% with an 
                  additional 60 stores in 2012. Our store penetration 
                  analysis shows a higher mix of weak and transitional 
                  malls, which has increased from 20% to 23% of the total 
                  store base, which would be expected as the concept 
                  expands. 

                  Inventory/sqft is up 9.7% and should moderate in 
                  2012. After two quarters of mid-20s increases in 
                  inventory/sqft, the company should continue to lower 
                  inventory levels after seeing increases from its direct 
                  sourcing initiative, planning holiday inventory, and taking 
                  early shipments to benefit from lower costs. 

                  Management gives tempered 2012 guidance. Q1                     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                  guidance calls for 18-20 new store and sales between            companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                  $44 to $45M on +L-MSD comps and EPS range of $0.09              a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                  to $0.10. FY2012 EPS should grow +2532% to                     have a conflict of interest that could affect the 
                                                                                  objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors 
                  $0.58$0.61 on revenues growing +24-28% to                      should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a 
                  $208$215M on +MSD comps.                                       single factor in making their investment decision.

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
