                              FIVE REASONS TO BUY THIS STOCK TODAY 
 
                              1)   LBS is rocking and TeleNav is the lead singer:   According to a 2010 Juniper Research study, 1.5 
                                   billion consumer users are forecasted to drive annualized mobile location based services (LBS) revenues 
                                   to $12.7B by 2014.  We believe that through its curren t LBS offerings alone, TeleNav is poised to address 
                                   at least $5.0B of this market.  With 19.6M user    s as of December 31, 2010, Telenav has the largest 
                                   revenue-generating consumer LBS user base amongs t over 6,000 LBS related ve ndors globally. TeleNavs 
                                   success in its core mobile navigation platform is a  key enabler of other location based opportunities such 
                                   as mobile advertising, in-dash automotive navigation, and mobile resource management.  Since going 
                                   public in May of 2010, TNAV has grown its user base by 63%, adding 7M new users.       As a greater 
                                   percentage of revenue is generated from new ma rket segments, and as it  scales as a mobile 
                                   LBS platform, the EV/EBITDA multiple should expand accordingly.             See chart below.

                              2)   Customers are massive and motivated to drive revenue for TNAV:  Telenav is partnered with 15 
                                   leading carriers with a global footprint of 29 countries who need on-deck LBS apps to maintain subscriber 
                                   stickiness and drive ARPU.  Despite having grown its user base by 63% Y/Y, TeleNav still only has a 7% 
 
                                   penetration rate among 5 US-based carrier clients, which have 275 million subscribers combined. The 
                                   company is just beginning to deploy with leading in ternational mobile operators, where signed contracts 
                                   represent a universe of 720 million potential users.  Wi th third-party off-deck LBS providers like Google 
                                   (GOOG-Q), and AOL threatening to turn carriers into  dumb pipes, TeleNav is a key partner for carriers 
                                   to capture earnings in the rapidly growing market for LBS applications.     
 
                              3)   Post-IPO disaster averted, stock reacts to execution:       One of the potentially unintended 
                                   consequences of the IPO in May of 2010 was to expose  just how much money TNAV was making from its 
                                   largest customer Sprint.  Upon viewing the 45%+  adjusted EBITDA margins and the 24%+ net income 
                                   margins, Sprint may have decided to rebalance the      deal.  Leveraging its customer dominance, Sprint 
                                   forced the contract to be re-opened and re-negotiated. Upon disclosing the renegotiation to the market 
                                   with no assurances of success, TeleNavs shares subsequently plummeted to a low of $4.68.  A month 
                                   later, TNAV announced that Sprint had agreed to new terms and then in October the company 
                                   confounded the market by beating expectations and gu iding higher  despite the Sprint deal.  Then they 
                                   did again in January. Investors bega n to realize that the renegotiated Sprint contract may be better than 
                                   at first glance and that TeleNav is not a broken business.   
                              4)   New Sprint deal  more users, more revenue  streams, better economics:   The new Sprint deal 
                                   benefits TeleNav in two not well understood ways:  i) Because margins improve on scaling, Sprint is 
                                   incented to include Telenav in more data bundles up-s old to more current subscribers, thus accelerating 
                                   the potential user base for Telenav; and ii) by carving out a greater revenue split for Telenav on 
                                   incremental services, TeleNavs top-line becomes more  highly levered to emerging rapid growth areas in 
                                   LBS such as mobile advertising, m-commerce, lead generation, and other emerging revenue models. 
 
                              5)   Free Fear is Overdone:    TeleNavs greatest perceived competit ive risk comes from free mobile 
                                   handset navigation applications, particularly from G oogle.  This threat has be en and continues to be a 
                                   drag on its valuation relative to its peers.  Through solid investments over the past three years, we 
                                   believe the company is mitigating this threat  TeleNa v should earn increasingly higher valuation multiples 
                                   as the company continues to de-risk   the threat of free alternatives  by: i) winning global automotive 
                                   OEM contracts for in-dash navigation with companies like Ford and Delphi; ii) demonstrating the 
                                   effectiveness of its mobile advertising model with drive to rates of 24%; iii) signing deals with leading 
 
                                   global carriers like Vivo and China Mobile; and iv) continuing to penetrate the enterprise.

                              WHO IS TELENAV? 
 
                              Headquartered in Santa Clara California, TeleNav is a      cloud-based provider of location-based applications 
                               delivered to GPS-enabled phones.  TeleNav was incorporated in Delaware in 1999 and went public in May 2010 
                              with a listing on the NASDAQ as TNAV. The company  has 953 employees with 800 engineers, of which about 
                               500 are located in the companys R&D facilities in China.   
                              TeleNavs flagship turn-by-turn (TBT) mobile navigation platform was launched with Nextel (now Sprint) in 
 
                              2002.  Since then they have launched with AT&T, US Cellul ar, T-Mobile as well as leading international carriers 
                               such as China Mobile,  Vivo, and Telcel.  With 19.6M paying users, the company is currently global leader in 
                              mobile navigation.   
                               The companys leadership in mobile navigation platfo    rm has acted as a springboard to adjacent market 
                              opportunities in mobile advertising, mobile commerce , mobile resource management (MRM), and automotive 
 
                              in-dash solutions.  Through significant investments and solid execution across a broad range of vertical 
                               markets, TeleNav has increased it market opportunity to  $5.0B (up from $1.5B) as an end-to-end LBS platform 
                              spanning across multiple distribution channels in      cluding handsets, operating systems, carriers, and

                              CLOUD-BASED, SERVICE DELIVERY ARCHITECTURE 
                              The TeleNav navigation solution is implemented on a   cloud-based architecture, wh ich allows a multitude of 
                              navigation services to be delivered to almost all the  mobile handsets in the market.  The mobile-phone-based 
 
                              navigation application takes basic location readings fr  om GPS signals and cell-tow er triangulation and then 
                              sends them back to TeleNavs servers.  Based on a user s location and desired destination, TeleNav runs map 
                              lookups and routing algorithms at the server level, before sending out the set of instructions to get to a 
                               targeted address.    
                              Since the application essentially exists in the cloud, upgrades to the services or the addition of incremental 
 
                              capabilities can be implemented easily.  Recent additions to the platform include the ability to deliver targeted 
                               mobile advertising or to track a mobile field workers lo cation and progress.  The cloud platform makes it easy 
                              to add content, services, and partners.

                              TeleNavs service delivery system includes a direct connection to the carrier partners back-end, allowing for 
                              seamless authentication and billing.  Carriers bill customers directly and the revenues are passed on to 
                              TeleNav. End users do not have to set up and pay a se  parate bill and TeleNav does not have to develop its 
                              own billing infrastructure or take on additional credit risks.   
 
                              GIS data is pulled from TeleAtlas and Navteq, while POI information comes from multiple third-party sources. 
                              Local advertisements are provided by ad networks such as yp.com, Yelp, or directly from advertisers (e.g., 
                              Darden Restaurants, Holiday Inn, etc.).  TeleNavs application programming interfaces (APIs) allow third party 
                              developers to connect TeleNav's location-based services, such as turn-by-turn directions and location sharing, 
                              to their mobile and web applications. This helps developers reach the companys 20 million subscribers and 
                              enables seamless navigation and location sharing acro ss all major mobile operat ing systems on hundreds of 
                              devices supported by the networks of TeleNav's carrier partners.

                              visibility.  Over the past three fiscal years ended June 30, TNAV achieved a revenue CAGR of 89% - growing 
growth coming from       from $48.1M in FY08 to $171.2M in FY 10.  Revenue growth to date has pr imarily been driven by Sprint and 
new segments              AT&T which represented 61% and 29% of FY09 revenue and 55% and 34% of FY10 revenue.   
                              During Q211, TeleNav reduced its revenue concentration from Sprint and AT&T to 44% and 40% of total 
                              revenue respectively.  Q211 revenue from US Cellular and T-Mobile grew by 169% Y/Y to account for $4.3M 
                              or 9% of total revenue, up from $1.6M in Q210.  We expect this trend to continue and we see Sprint/AT&T 
                              revenue concentration declining considerably to 35%     and 31% by FY12 as the company ramps up its 
                              deployments with new carrier partners, new automotive OEMs, and new content providers.   
                              While management has not delineated specific contribution from automotive, mobile advertising, and MRM, 
                              they indicated that the company is on track to exit FY11 with a run-rate of about 10% of total revenues from 
                              these business segments.  This is up from 7% of total Q211 revenue.

                               REVENUE FORECAST ASSUMPTIONS  
                                    Carrier TBT Navigation:  We believe that Sprint currently pays about $20M per quarter in its fixed fee 
 
                                    contract with TeleNav until Decemb er 2012.  We expect Sprint to ro  llover the agreement but at lower 
                                     successive rates.  Our forecast also assumes that a majority of TeleNavs US carrier partners will migrate 
                                    to fixed fee arrangements by H213.  For its international carrier partners, we are forecasting modest until 
                                     network infrastructure begins to mature in emergi      ng markets.   Based on the current pace capital 
                                    spending on equipment and infrastructure, we expect this to occur by 2013.         
 
                                    Automotive:  For FY12 and beyond, we expect rapid gr  owth from TeleNavs automotive revenues as 
                                     SYNC navigation becomes a standard feature in all Fords and MyTouch gains traction amongst 
                                    consumers.  We do not anticipate any contribution from Delphi until H212 as automakers typically take 
                                     between one and two years to begin production once they have chosen their suppliers. 

                                    Mobile Advertising:  We see advertising as a key growth driver for the company given the breadth of 
                                    their platform and early success with drive-to-rates.  However, since TeleNavs advertising platform was 
                                     only launched in September 2010, we expect limited   advertising revenue in the near term.  While we 
                                    anticipate rapid growth from this segment, it will be from a small base.  Consequently, we are not 
                                     modeling mobile advertising as a 10% revenue contributor until FY13.  

                                    Enterprise MRM:  To date, TeleNav has relied primarily on it s carrier partnerships with AT&T and Sprint 
                                    as sales channels for their MRM business.  Given that TeleNavs two most direct competitors also sell 
                                     through the same channels and the undifferentiated core product suites, we are modeling in modest 
                                    growth in this segment.  We could become more constructive about TeleNavs MRM business if company 
                                     builds out more direct sales and marketing resources and delivers some solid customer wins over the next 
                                    two quarters.

                              Gross Margin:  TeleNav has historically enjoyed gross margins in excess of 80%, with gross margins of 83% 
                              over the last four quarters.  Management expects this to decline to about 80% by the end of FY11 due to 
                               higher third party data costs as automotive and mobile advertising contribute more to revenue.  Longer term, 
                              management has set a gross margin target range of 72% to 75%.   
                                
                              Adj. EBITDA:  Before reporting adj. EBITDA margins of 38.6%  for Q211, TeleNav had achieved adj. EBITDA 
                               margins in excess of 40% for the prior eight quarters and reported an annual adj. EBITDA margin of 45.9% for 
                              FY10.  During Q211, management di sclosed that 30% of its operating costs were being allocated to strategic 
 
                              growth areas which only contribute to 7% of the companys total revenues today.  As management is 
                               expecting to increase R&D investments to capture a grea  ter share of the growing LBS pie, they guided that 
                              longer term adj. EBITDA would fall in the range of 33% to 36%.  We believe that significant investments in 
                               R&D are the key to TeleNavs future and are forecastin  g more modest longer term adj. EBITDA margins of 
                              about 30%.

                              Net Income:  Driven by historically high gross and operating margins, TeleNav has in the past achieved a net 
                               income margins in the range of 23% to 27%.  Net income is negatively impacted by a high California corporate 
                              tax rate which is currently in excess of 40%.  As intern ational operations begin contributing more to revenue, 
                               we expect the tax rate to decline to about 35%.

                              Due to minimal working capital and capital expenditure  requirements, TeleNav generates a consistent stream 
                               of free cash flow and has a solid debt free balance sh  eet.  In addition to rais ing $44.6M from its May 2010 
                              IPO, the company generated FCF of $36.4M.  During H211, TeleNav added an additional $44.1M in FCF exiting 
                               Q211 with a total cash balance of $155.7M.  We believe  that Sprint made an upfront annual payment of $80M 
                              in January to cover its fixed licensing obligations for 2011 inferring a pro forma cash balance of over $235M or 
                               $5.60 per share.       
                               As of December 31, 2010 there were 42.2 million basic sh ares outstanding and 45.9 million fully diluted shares 
                              outstanding including options.  Insiders control 11.7% of shares outstanding with 49.1% of outstanding shares 
                               retained by its venture capital investors.

                               According to Berg Insight, there were 200 million turn-by- turn installations in North  America and Europe as of 
                                June 2010. Although Personal Navigation Devices (P       ND) such as those offered by TomTom and Garmin 
                               represent the largest install base, navigation enabled phones are the fastest growing category. Of the 44 
                                million phones enabled with TBT navigation as of J une 2010, TeleNavs 16.1M user s accounted for 36.5% of 
                               the market.  We expect that as the penetration of GPS   enabled phones in the market increases, phones will 
                                eclipse PNDs as the access point for TBT navigation.

                              Frost & Sullivan estimates that the market for TeleNavs core on-deck carrier TBT product should grow at a 
                              CAGR of 20% from $614M to over $1.5B by 2015.  This  forecast excludes ad-based revenue but includes up-
                              sells of premium services such as traffic or speed trap   alerts.  Key drivers in the growth of the carrier TBT 
                              navigation market are: 
                                   A.   Pre-loaded TBT is a Strategic Focus for Carriers :  With third-party off-deck LBS providers like 
                                        Google (GOOG-Q), Foursquare, and Where? threatening  to turn carriers into dumb pipes, carriers 
                                        are increasingly turning to TBT navigation to aggressively monetize data, mitigate churn rates and 
                                        declining ARPU.  Carriers view personalization options associated with mobile navigation as a 
                                        potential source of customer loyalty as well as an entry point to a broader array of new revenue 
                                        streams such as mobile advertising and local se  arch.  AT&Ts 411 and yp.com mobile search and 
                                        advertising platforms are deeply integrated with TeleNavs pre-loaded navigator application.   
                                   B.   Proliferation of GPS Enabled Phones :  IDC estimates that only about 16% (205M) of mobile 
                                        phones globally are 3G+ GPS enabled 205M.  As this number almost triples to over 520M by 2014, 
                                        we believe consumers will increasingly turn to their mobile phones for turn by turn navigation as a 
                                        substitute to PND devices. 

                                                                           TeleNav User Base

                              CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES LEADING GLOBAL CARRIERS  
                              Telenav is partnered with 15 carriers with a global footprint of 29 countries representing a potential universe of 
                              720M users globally.  Sprint deployed TeleNavs TBT   navigation product in 2002 and is currently TeleNavs 
                              largest customer representing 44% of total revenues.    TeleNav launched with its second biggest customer, 
                              AT&T in 2007, which now accounts for 40% of total revenues.      
                              Newer US carrier partners US Cellular and T-Mobile      are beginning show traction  with revenue from these 
                              deployments growing 169% Y/Y to $4.3M   in Q211 from $1.6M in Q210.           US Cellular and T-Mobile now 
                              represents 9% of total revenue, up from 6% Y/Y.   
                            
                              Internationally, TeleNav has signed up leading carriers such as China Mobile, Telcel GS, Vivo, and Orange. 
                              China Mobile on its own represents a potential universe of 560 million users.  Revenue from these international 
                              carriers represented 4% of total Q211 revenue, up from 3% Y/Y.  Although the number of potential users in 
 
                              emerging countries such as China and Brazil is staggeri ng, we do not expect material contribution from these 
                              markets until their network infrastructures mature.  These countries also lag North America and Europe in the 
                              adoption of GPS enabled phones.  We  anticipate that significant growth should occur in these markets by late 
                              2013 or early 2014.

                              PRICING MODELS 
                              GPS Navigator revenues are either billed directly to end-users by carriers as a Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) 
 
                              or as part of a bundle of services offered with data plans.  Currently, Sprint is the only carrier bundling the 
                               application as part of its all inclusive data plans.  Users do not have to opt-in as they are not explicitly charged 
                              for the service.  We believe that Sprint pays TeleNa    v a fixed fee of $20M per quarter for the term of its 
                               agreement which ends in December 31 2012.   
                              With the rest of its carrier partners, TNAV operates through a Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) revenue share 
 
                              model.  The TNAV application is typically white-labele d and pre-loaded onto the ca rriers GPS enabled phones 
                               and users have the option to activate the application fo r a monthly fee of $7-$10 which carriers then split with 
                              TeleNav.  Carriers typically offer a free month of service to spur initial user adoption.   
                                  
                              We believe that TBT navigation syst ems will continue to be used as a weapon against off-deck handset-
                               based free services (most notably Google) that disinter mediate subscriber revenue streams. TeleNav is well-
                              positioned as a platform for carriers  to capture a broader array of adve rtising, commerce, and content based 
                               revenue streams. As a result, we pr  edict that TBT navigation will become a standard feature bundled into 
                              personalized subscriber data plans. Consequently, we expect carriers to transition from the MRC model to fixed 
                               fees.  This should result in a rapid expansion of TeleNav s user growth rates as users will no longer explicitly 
                              pay for the service.  In the end, carriers will fight free with free. 
 
                              We believe that some per-unit licensees are likely to    migrate to a similar licensing model as Sprint, which 
                               promotes more users, and revenue sharing for incremental services layered on top of the TBT platform.

                               eMarketer predicts that US mobile advertising will grow at a 43% CAGR from $416M in 2009 to $2.6B by 2014.  
                              To address this market opportunity, TeleNav launched   its location based advertising platform in September 
 
                              2010.  Although not a material contributor to revenue toda y, we believe TeleNav is well positioned to capture 
                               this market opportunity through its large and growing  base of 20M+ users conducting 40M+ local searches per

                              with a competitive edge in mobile advertising as the   fragmented nature of mobile operators, handsets, and 
                              operating systems has made the process of buying and   delivering mobile advertising very complex.  Having 
                              captured the leading share of mobile navigation users  across carriers, platforms and mobile devices, TeleNav 
                              acts as a one-stop shop for publishers to deliver location-based ads.      
                              TeleNavs mobile advertising platform also generates va luable data for advertiser s.  In November 2010, the 
                              company released usage data indicating the brands driver s were most actively searching for while on the road. 
TeleNavs mobile           The top brands were identified by analyzing how freq  uently TeleNav's users entered the brand names as a 
advertising platform       keyword search on its mobile navigation application. The  data revealed leading  brands  in a variety of vertical 
                              industries measured by local search queries.  For instance, TeleNav's data analysis found that six of the top ten 
generates valuable         most searched restaurants in the US were fast-food locations with McDonald's topping the charts as the 
data for advertisers        number one.   
which is still to be 
                              Local search data can be of great value to potential advertisers as they can use TeleNavs ad platform to place 
monetized.                  their listings at the top of the search results list and include deals or coupons within their listings to increase 
                              the number of users who visit their locations after conducting a search.     
 
                               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                             
                               
                              REVENUE POTENTIAL FOR U.S. BASED M-ADVERTISING IS SUBSTANTIAL 
                              During Q211, TeleNav reported a click thru rate of  3.5% and a drive-to-rate of  24%.  We believe that the 
                              drive-to-rate results were based on campaigns with seve ral national restaurant, hotel, and retail chains and 
                              estimate that TeleNav generated about $3 per drive to.  The company explained that the high drive-to rate 
                              was because 84% of users were in their cars when sear  ching for a place to go, indicating that search views 
                              occurred when users were at a high point of need.  For instance, display ads or coupons for restaurant 
                              properties would be delivered at the very moment a user is searching for food around their current location. 
 
                              To illustrate the revenue potential of mobile advertising on the TeleNav platform today, we assumed an 
                              average cost per click (CPC) of $0.25 on display ads      and a $3.00 cost per action (CPA) for drive-tos.  
                              Assuming that 24% of users who click thru continue to drive to, we arrive at a total revenue potential today 
                              of $2.4M.  Current revenue potential is limited by the % of users with ad enabled clients as well as a low fill 
                              rate which is a function of the number of advertisers on the network. Both performance limitations should 
                              decline quickly with adoption. 
                              We expect that the number of users with ad enabled cl ients will increase over time to 100% as carriers pre-
                              load them onto handsets anticipation of driving ad   based revenues.  If TeleNav can increase the number of 
                              monthly searches per user and increase its fill rate as more advertisers are added to the network, then at 50% 
                              penetration of its US carrier partners subscriber bases,  the revenue potential increases by a multiple of almost 
                              85x to $203.6M.

                                    Over the next five years, we believe that OEM TBT in-dash navigation could become standard on the majority 
 
                                    of the 25M to 30M passenger cars sold in Europe and North America annually.  ABI Research predicts that over 
                                    60% of these navigation solutions will be connected and software-based by that time.  We estimate that 
                                    TeleNavs total addressable market in the OEM automotive space could be worth as much as $1.5B by 2014.   
                                    Cloud-based TBT will be adopted by automotive OEMs as a substitute to todays unconnected in-dash PND due 
                                    to software cost advantages , advances in on-board connectivity, and to better extensibility to meet changing 
 
                                    customer needs. Additionally, software navigation solu tions can provide drivers with real-time data, and can 
                                    reduce driver distraction through voice interaction.  Te leNavs automotive applications can be integrated with 
                                    all the major operating systems that could be selected by automotive OEMs including Linux, Windows CE, QNX, 
                                    and Android.

                                    the Fords SYNC and MyTouch in-dash platforms.  SYNC  became available on all Fords beginning in 2010 and 
                                    MyTouch is standard on all Lincoln and high-end Fords.   The SYNC navigation system is strictly voice activated 
                                    and connects to the drivers phone via Bluetooth sending data  over the carriers network.  In addition to all the 
                                    features of SYNC, MyTouch features a visual, touch-screen interface.

                                    payment is recognized over the term of the contract                 which based on standard OEM contracts, which we 
                                    assume to be five years.  For SYNC, the company receives and recognizes a monthly fee per vehicle. We 
                                    estimate that about 1M cars shipped by Ford this year came equipped with the SYNC or MyTouch systems.

                              recently announced partnership with QNX increases the  potential for new deals with global manufacturers like 
                              Mercedez-Benz, and BMW.  Based on the pricing of       OEM in-dash navigation offerings from TomTom and 
                              Garmin, we believe that TeleNav could generate approximately $50.00 per vehicle.            
                               
 
                              M  OBILE    R ESOURCE       M  ANAGEMENT         (MRM) 
                              TeleNavs Enterprise Mobile Resource Management (MRM) enables companies to manage mobile resources to 
                              enhance productivity and efficiency. Mobile resources in  clude field workers, vehicl es and other assets.  The 
                              MRM market can be broken out into the Field Worker Market and the Automatic Vehicle Location Market (AVL).  
                              AVL focuses on the geographic location of vehicle fleets and is also referred to as telematics. MRM for mobile 
                              field workers are solutions for employees who spend a majority of their time out-of-office such as cable 
                              installers, utility workers, and sales professionals. 
                              Although TeleNav offers both AVL and field worker so     lutions, the company primarily focuses on the field 
                              worker market which we expect to grow at a CAGR        of 46% to $744M in 2013, up from $166M in 2009.  
                              Growth will be primarily driven by adoption of ha    ndset based MRM solutions to improve mobile worker 
                              productivity in combination with a steep decline in the cost of GPS enabled handsets and data plans.  
                              According to Frost & Sullivan, the annual cost of deploying the MRM solution has decreased at a CAGR of 
                              around 27% from $1526/subscriber in 2005 to $538/subscriber in 2009.   
 
                              In addition to real-time alerts, traffic re-routing and TBT navigation, TeleNavs MRM solutions provide 
                              enterprises with the mobile workforce productivity enhancing applications such as wireless timecards, dynamic 
                              scheduling/dispatching, wireless data capture forms,   and back office integratio n.  TeleNav has over 9,000 
                              enterprise customers to date and most recently won a deployment with FedEx.   
                              Similar to its flagship TBT product, TeleNavs key distribution channels for its MRM solutions are the mobile 
                              carriers.  The company is currently partnered with AT&T , Sprint, and Verizon who ar e responsible for tracking 
                              usage information and providing a single bill to customers.  MRM productivity suites are primarily marketed 
                              and sold by the carriers as up-sells to their enterprise customers and then split on a per user basis with 
                              TeleNav.  TeleNav also earns incremental revenue from  professional services in deploying and integrating its 
                              solution with a customers back office.           
 
                               

                              COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 
                              As TeleNav executes its platform strategy and extends its offerings beyond mobile navigation, it competes with 
                              a multitude of segment specialists and potential substi  tutes.  The companys greatest perceived competitive 
                              threat for user share comes from free mobile navigation applications, particularly from Google.  Management 
                              has indicated that the company has ma  de significant investments over the past three years to contain this 
 
                              threat.  During Q211, management disclosed that 30% of  its operating costs were being allocated to strategic 
                              growth areas which only contribute to 7% of the companys total revenues today.  We believe the following 
                              data points support our view that the threat of free may not be as great a risk as investors perceive:  
                              1)   TeleNav is partnered and tightly integrated with larg e carriers whose influence  with handset makers may 
                                   be underestimated.  Carriers have the ability to pre-load and bundle mobile navigation services onto their 
                                   handsets offerings.  As carriers fight to protect data margins in the expanding market place for location 
                                   based services, we could see carriers pressure Android handset makers into not pre-loading Googles 
                                   mobile navigator to minimize Googles control of location content.     
 
                              2)   TeleNavs navigator is available across over 600 smart phones and feature phones: 50% of phones on the 
                                   market today are feature phones without access to free TBT navigation.     
                              3)   With a cross channel, multi-device, multi-OS, and multi-carrier platform, TeleNav simplifies the process of 
                                   buying and delivering mobile content and advertis   ing for advertising partners.  Having captured the 
                                   leading share of mobile navigation users across carr iers, platforms and mobile devices, TeleNav is one-
 
                                   stop shop for publishers to deliver ads.

                                                                                                                        February 25, 2011
  
                               4)   Free navigation apps like Android have actually helped to grow TNAV user base by raising consumer 
                                   awareness. Since Android came to market with free  navigation two years ago, TNAV has doubled its user 
                                    base. 
                               5)   Free navigation apps are not actu  ally free as users still pay for data consumed.  We believe that 
                                   current monthly recurring charge (MRC) carrier partners  are likely to migrate to Sprints bundling model 
                                    which essentially makes TeleNav also free in the perception of users.   
                              6)   The Chinese telecom industry strictly protects state owned carriers like China Mobile.  This provides a 
 
                                   competitive moat in respect of TeleNavs access to China Mobiles 584M subscribers as carriers can use 
                                    government regulations to exclude the use of third party mobile navigation on its handsets.    
                              7)   TeleNavs recurring revenue model and solid balanc     e sheet provides the company with the financial 
                                    flexibility to invest in new strategic areas through acquisitions or organically. 
                               
                              MOBILE NAVIGATION 
                               TeleNavs most direct competitor in the on-deck mobile navigation space is Telecommunications Systems (TCS) 
                              through its acquisition of Networks in Motion (NIM) in No vember 2009.  However, with four of the five largest 
                               carriers in the US signed up and over 20M users, TeleNav has a significant lead.  Other smaller carrier aligned 
                              mobile navigation vendors include Telmap, Jentro, and Appello Systems.   
 
                              TeleNav also competes with numerous other paid TBT navi gation apps available in mobile app stores such as 
                               Sygic and Navigon.  However, TeleNav consistently outp  erforms these apps in the majority of professional 
                              reviews from blogs such as Gizmodo.com, Androidguys.com. and crackberry.com.   
 
                               
                              AUTOMOTIVE 
                               In the automotive segment, TeleNav primarily competes with on-board factory fitted hardware based 
                              navigation devices from vendors such as Garmin an  d TomTom.  These devices are typically unconnected, 
                               difficult to update, and do not provide  drivers with real time information.  In contrast, cloud based navigation 
                              solutions like Fords MyTouch or SYNC offerings provide drivers with the most up to date maps and real time 
                               traffic information as well as points of interest.           
                               Due to their cost advantages to auto makers as well as the benefit of real time data to drivers, ABI Research 
                              predicts that by 2014, connected software-based naviga  tion will dominate hardware based solutions in the 
                               automotive space.  We believe that through its partnerships with Ford, Delphi, and QNX, TeleNav is well 
                              positioned to capture a sizeable piece of the automotive navigation market.   
 
                               
 
                              ENTERPRISE LBS 
 
                              TeleNav distributes its mobile resource management solu  tions to the enterprise through direct and indirect 
                               channels in partnership with Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon.   Each one of these partners also acts as distribution 
                              channels TeleNavs direct competitors in mobile resour ce management. Primary competitors also marketed by 
                               Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon are Xora and ActSoft with limited differentiation in core product functionality.   
                              Despite showing solid traction other areas, although we  believe that the company could face challenges within 
 
                              the highly competitive and complex enterprise MRM segment.  Even as TeleNav competes with Xora and 
                               Actsoft through its mobile operator channels, there are a myriad of competitors with deep expertise in logistics 
                              and supply chain management that sell directly ente      rprises including large players such as Trimble and 
                               Descartes Systems.  There are also numerous point solutions such as telematics, field worker software 
                              vendors, and large hardware vendors such as Ingenico and Intermec that also provide MRM solutions to the 
                               enterprise.

                               VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
                               We are initiating coverage with a target price of $16.  80 based on applying a 7.0x EV multiple to our FY12 
                               EBITDA estimate of $79.5M.  This is supported by our fi ve year DCF value of $16.34 based on a discount rate 
                               of 12% and a terminal growth rate of 3%.   
At 3.7x, TNAV trades at

on a F12 EV/EBITDA       suppliers, and carrier software.  The median FY12 multiples within each of these industry silos range from a 
basis. We think it           low of 5.9x in the case of carrier software vendors to       a high of 16.7x in the case of high growth SaaS 
should be closer to the     platforms.   
                                
LBS median of 7.2x. 
                               On an enterprise value basis, TNAV is trading at    3.4x LTM EBITDA of $87.4M and 3.7x our FY12 EBITDA 
                               estimate of $79.5M.  The considerable discount may           reflect investors concerns relating to customer 
                               concentration, the competitive threat  of free alternatives, and the risk  s associated with execution of the 
                               companys strategic growth initiatives.  We believe that  these perceived risks have been overly priced into the 
                               stock.   
                                
                               TeleNav is a high growth company with significant earnin gs leverage and we think as investors see evidence of 
                               continued execution in gaining user share and diversifying  its revenue streams, the stock could eventually earn 
                               multiples in-line with those of high-growth SaaS companies.  However, since 93% of the companys revenue is 
                               currently generated through its core mobile navigation   product, we look to LBS vendors which trade at a 
                               median of 7.2x FY12 EV/EBITDA as the baseline for our valuation.

                               Relative to its publicly traded LBS peers, TeleNav trades at a FY12 EV/EBITDA discount of 48%.  Considering 
                               that TeleNav has achieved a revenue CAGR of 89% over the past three fiscal years while maintaining EBITDA 
                               margins of 40%, we believe that such  a significant discount is unwarranted.  Our target price of $16.80 based 
                               on 7.0x FY12 EV/EBITDA is well supported by our DCF model which values the company at $16.34 per share.

                                              KEY RISKS 
 
                                              Customer Concentration: For some investors potential customer concentration risk became very real during 
                                              the summer of 2010 when Sprint, which currently repr                                      esents approximately 40% of TeleNav revenues, 
                                              unilaterally decided to renegotiate a long-standing                                    contract. The stock declined by 39% after this 
                                              announcement. There is no certainty that AT&T will not behave similarly in the future. The positive news is 
                                              that the company has been successful in reduce customer  concentration, and we predict that by 2013, Sprint 
                                              customer concentration could decline to 35%. 

                                              Competitive Disruption: It is hard to get more disruptive than free, and TeleNav has still managed to 
                                              increase its user base in the face of free service. The next possible level of competitive disruption could be 
                                              competitive vertical consolidation among data providers,  LBS platforms, content providers, and even carriers 
                                              themselves. Vertical consolidation among competitors could cause service disruption, reduced margins due to 
                                              fewer supplier options, and even lost clients if carriers are involved.  TeleNav has a very solid balance sheet 
                                              that if can use to defend against competitor consolidation via acquisition or partnerships. 
 
                                              Intellectual Property: There have been several recently granted patents related to Location-Based Services 
                                               and specifically local advertising. Several smaller players such as Poynt and Where? have patents or patent 
                                              claim continuations that could cause murkiness around intellectual property in the short to medium term. The 
                                              uncertainty regarding patents could increase operating ex                                 penses due to litigation,   and could result in gross 
                                              margin compression if TeleNav is required to pay royalties to third-parties on certain local advertising and 
                                              search methods. 
                                              Content Supply:  TeleNav relies on 3                         rd
                                                                                                              parties to supply data. If they were to stop supplying content to 
                                              TeleNav, its service offering would be impaired result                              ing in potential service disruption and even customer 
                                              contract cancellations. The content supply chain is fairly mature and each element of content has multiple 
                                              suppliers. As a cloud-based service, access to alternat                              ive suppliers could occur with relatively minor service 
                                              disruption (if any). However, a new contract with altern ative suppliers could be more  costly, impacting future 
                                              gross margins.    
                                              Carrier Dependence: TeleNav is dependent upon carrier partners to behave as anticipated in order to assure 
                                              future growth in revenue and earnings. If customers st                                  op reselling TeleNav solutions or they dramatically 
                                              change pricing, then future growth could be impair                                ed.  As well, TeleNav is dependent upon access to a 
                                              growing subscriber base controlled by carrier partners.                                If subscribers are lost, then TeleNavs future growth 
                                              may be impaired.  
                                              Global Economic Conditions:  Although mobile subscriptions have become a utility and are somewhat 
                                              immune to worldwide economic conditions, new market segments like automotive and advertising have proven 
                                              to be highly sensitive to worldwide market conditions. Short-term economic uncertainty caused by spikes in 
                                              commodity prices (such as oil) could trigger unfavorable economic conditions that could impair growth and 
                                              future cash flows.
