                                              Our  recent  survey  of  100  IT  Managers*  points  to  positive  leading  indicators  for
                                              salesforce.com, LivePerson, Active Network and Oracle, as these companies distribute
                                              products  into  the  top-tier  Application  spending  categories.  We  are  also  bullish  on
                                              Kenexa and marginally more positive on Ultimate Software, and like the SaaS-based
                                              product suites from SilkRoad and Halogen as our field checks indicate the secular
                                              trends for Talent Management remain strong. Additionally, we think customers are
                                              increasingly  standardizing  on,  what  we  view  as,  best-in-class  SaaS-based  Talent
                                              Management platforms owing to the easing of competitor pressures. Reiterate Buys:
