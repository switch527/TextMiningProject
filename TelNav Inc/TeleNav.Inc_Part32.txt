       Good quarter and guide, but Sprint renegotiation arises                                                         9.6
       Telenav reported 4QFY10 revenue of $49.5  million ahead of our estimate of $46.7                                9.2

       Sprint negotiation becomes an overhang                                                                                    TeleNav
       In their press release the company warned that their 55% customer Sprint could                                            S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)

       at first sounds, until the company can provi de clearer guidance on this we believe                          Stock & option liquidity data 
       the matter will remain an overhang on the stock.                                                             Market Cap (USDm)                                                                481.9

       Setting aside long-term concerns, the comp  anys core business did well in the                              Volume (29 Jul 2010)                                                           62,926
       quarter. They saw growth across customers and segments. Sprints growth                                      Option volume (und. shrs., 1M avg.)             
       remains a very positive contributor in the quarter, but business grew elsewhere                             
       including AT&T, newly-won US Cellular,  AT&T, China Mobile and their non carrier 
       businesses as well. In MRM, they won a ma jor contract to provide asset tracking 
       for a large manufacturer (which we believe is Xerox).  

       Lowering price target from $12 to $9 and rating to Hold 
       We have valued Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 2% 
       perpetual growth rate in line with long-t erm industry growth and a 13% discount 
       rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta  of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%). Downside 
       risks the threat of continued competition fr  om free navigation providers such as 
       Google. Upside risks include the potential for a better-than expected resolution of 
       their Sprint contract negotiation.

30 July 2010       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                                

                                Telenav reported 4QFY10 revenue of $49.5 million ahead of our estimate of $46.7 million and 
                                consensus of $47.0 million; pro-forma EPS of $0. 31 came in well ahead of our estimate of 
                                $0.24 and consensus of $0.25.  The company guided ahead of expectations but cautioned 
                                that terms with their largest customer Sprint are being negotiated. 

                                Despite otherwise good results and what is likely a conservative Q1 guidance we think the 
                                renegotiation with Sprint could become a se      rious issue for Telenav. The chief risks 
                                associated with the company have always been  the high degree of customer concentration 
                                and the emerging threat of free navigation providers such as Google.  

                                It now appears that Sprints success at building subscribers with its bundled pricing plans has 
                                done well enough that they are looking to reduc e costs associated with that success.  We 
                                believe the success of the EVO Android phone fr om HTC as well as the progress of Android 
                                phones with other carriers may have prompted  Sprint to consider working more closely with 
                                Google. We do not believe that Telenav will be  displaced at Sprint, but  we do think they will 
                                come under pressure to offer more flexible prici ng terms. This may mean a further shift to 
                                advertising revenue for Telenav or some other  monetization method. The point being that no 
                                one can say what the new Sprint model for Te  lenav will look like. On the call the company 
                                was unable to answer many questions about   the subject given the ongoing nature of the 
                                negotiations.  

                                We also think the surprise here is not that Sprint is looking to bring prices down, but that they 
                                are looking to do so this early. The company  has long cautioned that over time they expect 
                                prices to go to zero for navigation. We th  ink the company received a discounted multiple 
                                relative to SaaS peers, in part because of th  e shift in business model from subscription 
                                revenue to a more ad-driven model. We origin ally expected that to occur over a number of 
                                years, but there is now the risk that the transition may happen much sooner. 

                                We do not mean to portray the situation as  overly dire. We see the most likely outcome of 
                                the Sprint renegotiating ending with lower pri  ces for Telenav, or possibly a split between 
                                smart phones for Google and feature phones for Telenav. But by no means do we think that 
                                Telenav will lose Sprint. There is still signific ant value in the companys operations. The main 
                                factor for the stock, however, will be the high  degree of uncertainty. Until there is more 
                                clarity over Sprint, these concerns will prove an  overhang on the stock. These concerns will 
                                likely overshadow any potential ne ar-term positive catalysts such as the announcement of a 
                                new carrier customer or a shift from a MRR plan to a bundle by AT&T.  

                                As a result we are lowering our rating from Buy to Hold. 

                                We are also reducing our forward estimates to reflect the potential for faster price erosion, as 
                                below.

30 July 2010       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                                  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei      r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin     g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
