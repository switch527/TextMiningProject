  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
