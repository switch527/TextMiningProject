THINK ACTION:

in our view.                                                                    52-Week High:                    $19.99

  Call  option  on  platform  play.  The  Active  Network  is  in  the  process  of
  transitioning its customer base onto a single platform called ActiveWorks. This
  transition should take 18-24 months to complete and ACTV's R&D expense
  and C.O.G.S. will be temporarily elevated as they end-of-life legacy platforms.
  Once  completed,  ACTV  will  operate  a  leaner  cost  structure  that  should
  provide leverage on future revenue growth, which we view as an attractive
  investment trait. Also, having one platform allows The Active Network to speed
  up innovation and deliver the latest functionality, which greatly enhances the
  number of new product cycles, increases customer stickiness, and puts The
  Active Network at the forefront of the industry's technology leaders, in our
  opinion.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 18x EV/EBITDA
multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $54M. We assume ACTV maintains a similar valuation multiple and believe this multiple
is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is in the middle of our 15-20%
long-term CAGR expectation.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.
