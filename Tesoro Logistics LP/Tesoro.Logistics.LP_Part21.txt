                                          bpd, while trucking volume of 23,879 was above our forecast of 23,500 bpd. Operating and

                                          were above.
                                          The results benefited from a $2 million credit, which will be reduced to $1 million going
                                          forward. Volumes should be lower in the fourth quarter due to seasonality.

                                          Tesoro previously announced a distribution of $0.35/unit ($1.40/unit annualized) for the third
                                          quarter of 2011. The distribution represents a 4% increase over the pro rated $0.2448/unit for
                                          the second quarter 2011 distribution. The distribution was in line with our estimate.
                                          We are maintaining our distribution estimates at $0.9548/unit for 2011, $1.54/unit for 2012,
                                          and $1.70/unit for 2013. Our estimates provide a 10.4% growth rate in 2013. This compares
                                          quite favorably to the 5.7% estimated average growth in 2013 for liquids-based partnerships
                                          under our coverage. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $2.15/unit for 2012 and
                                          $2.30/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.4x for both years.

                                         Estimates
                                         We are raising our 2011 EBITDA estimate to $42.2 million from $38.9 million and our 2012
                                         EBITDA estimate to $72.8 million from $65.2 million. We are increasing our 2011 DCF
                                         estimate to $39.5 million from $34.8 million and our 2012 DCF estimate to $67.1 million from
                                         $58.4 million. Our higher estimates primarily reflect lower expenses, higher revenues, and
                                         lower cash interest expense.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $27.50 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of
   return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.
