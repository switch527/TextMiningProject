                                     Areas of focus for the conference call: 
                                             Cadence of sales throughout 2Q, and sales trends into 3Q12. 
                                             Updated guidance for FY12. 
                                             The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact due to 
                                               acquisitions and inflation. Additionally, some color on trends on unique customers. 
                                             Progress on transitioning to the new facility in the Bronx and to the Praml facility in 
                                               Las Vegas. 
                                             Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                               operators that Chef serves.  
                                             Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its 
                                               customers. Additionally, managements outlook for inflation especially in dairy. 
                                             Trends in case volumes and revenues per case. 
                                             Managements thoughts on the opportunity for new market entries  specifically, how 
                                               many markets the company can ultimately enter and an outline of the criteria 
                                               management uses to evaluate potential markets. 
                                             An update on the quality of the acquisition pipeline, and on the companys sense of urgency 
                                               to enter new categories such as meat, seafood, produce, direct ship pastry and supplies. 
                                             Some color on the competitive environment. 
                                             Now that the company has acquired three comp anies over the last 13 months  some 
                                               commentary on the stickiness of the acquired customers, including: how retention 
                                               levels change as the transaction ages, a ty pical percentage of customers CHEF expects 
                                               to retain one year post acquisition, and how order sizes progress. 

                                     Dairy trends in 2Q12 and projections for the remainder of 2012.                  Exhibit 2 details dairy 
                                     prices in FY12 to date, year-over-year price comparisons, as well as forecasts for the remainder 
                                     of the year. While dairy could remain deflationary for the rest of FY12  the magnitude abates 
                                     materially  as a result, we believe the dairy h eadwind could be slightly lower than previously 
                                     discussed and guided. We will ask for an update on dairy on next weeks call.

                                Our 2Q12 EPS estimate is $0.23 vs. consensus of $0.24. Our EBITDA estimate is 
                                $9.3 million. Our estimate assumes total sales increase 19.0% to $118.1 million  driven by 
                                9.0% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 75 bp to 27.2%. We forecast 
                                operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 22.5%  to $22.9 million, or a 55 bp increase as a 
                                percentage of sales to 19.3%  leading to an 8 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.3%, or 
                                $8.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.3 million, a 20 bp expansion in margin to 7.9%. We 
                                assume interest expense of $0.4 million, a 41.0% tax rate, and 20.9 million shares outstanding, 
                                which gets us to EPS of $0.23  an 18.4% increase from 2Q11.  

                                In FY2012, our estimate is $0.91 vs. consensus of $0.91. Our EBITDA estimate is 
                                $36.6 million. Our estimate assumes total sales increase 15.2% to $461.0 million (vs. consensus 
                                of $463.1 million), with gross margins improving 67 bp to 27.0%. We forecast operating 
                                expenses (excluding D&A) grow 16.6% to $87. 8 million, a 24 bp year-over-year deterioration 
                                in margin  leading to a 39 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.4%, or $34.1 million. 
                                This gets us to EBITDA of $36.6 million, a 44 bp improvement in margin to 7.9%. We assume 
                                interest expense of $1.8 million, a 41.1% tax rate, and 20.9 million shares outstanding, which

compensation based in part on the overall performance of the firm, including investment banking income. We seek to update our research as

Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.
Restricted - Describes issuers where, in conjunction with Jefferies engagement in certain transactions, company policy or applicable securities
regulations prohibit certain types of communications, including investment recommendations.
Monitor - Describes stocks whose company fundamentals and financials are being monitored, and for which no financial projections or opinions on
the investment merits of the company are provided.

Valuation Methodology

return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market
risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF,
P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns,

      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
         is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
         non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
         to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
         target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
         the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.
      8. The conviction list is published once a month whilst global equity markets are closed.

Risk which may impede the achievement of our Price Target
This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the
financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based
upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of
the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and
income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial
and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may
adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. In addition, investors in securities such
as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.

VALUATION 
Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 18x our 2013 EPS forecast 
and 10x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples generally in the 
low teens on forward earnings and 7 to 8x EBITDA, the valuation is at a discount 
to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United 
Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $50.81 | BUY). We view UNFI as the best 
comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior 
margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18% UNFI’s gross margins are 
inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We continue 
to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on 
invested capital.  
We maintain our price target of $24.00, reflecting 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast 
and 22x our 2013 EPS estimate and the premium valuations of the specialty food 
peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, 
could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products 
sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and 
cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's 
operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer 
confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental 
economic weakness have impacted the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with 
larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. 
Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving 
the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of 
CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the 
brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations 
require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to 
similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of 
specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of 
and public awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and 
marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   25

the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 
In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

                                      On April 30, 2012, CHEF announced that it is purchasing Praml International for $19.5 
                                      million. Our view:  

                                            1.   If we assume the $12 million impact to FY2012 revenues (as stated on the call) is 
                                                 based on an 8-month time frame (because the deal has already closed), this actually 
                                                 implies a ~1.1x sales multiple  too rich in our view.         If acquisitions are to play a 
                                                 meaningful role in the companys future   growth (which we assume to be the 
                                                 case), multiples need to remain in the 0.3x-0.5x range. If they dont, ROIC will 
                                                 deteriorate and so will CHEFs valuation.  

                                            2.  EBITDA multiples are meaningless in our view because expenses at small, family-run 
                                                 operations are usually out of whack. 

                                            3.  Given Pramls expertise  a dominant provid            er of French cuisine products while 
                                                 CHEF is known for its Italian cuisine products  we understand why this acquisition 
                                                 makes sense strategically, and the customer          base should serve   to expand CHEFs 
                                                 market share in an extremely robust region of the country. 

                                            4.  In addition, CHEF will move its existing operations in Las Vegas (~11,440 sq. ft) to 
                                                 the Praml facility (>30,000 sq. ft.).

                                      5.  We would have preferred to see CHEF make an acquisition in a new market  Dallas, 
                                           Boston, Chicago  to name a few. While we do trust managements ability to execute 
                                           on integration of the Praml acquisition to ensure the acquisition is accretive, we are 
                                           still perplexed as to why Las Vegas was a focus when the company already has a 
                                           presence in the Las Vegas market.  

                                  In 1Q12, CHEFs sales growth was negatively  impacted by deflation of 1.7%, largely due 
                                  to deflation in the dairy category, which represents ~26% of sales at Chefs Warehouse. 
                                  In Exhibit 3 below, we compare the inflation rate provided by CHEF each quarter with a 
                                  weighted average CPI inflation rate (using       CHEFs category sales as weights). We 
                                  acknowledge that this is not a perfect comparison, but it does appear to indicate that deflation is 
                                  unique to CHEF given its specific product mix.

                                  We are decreasing our 2Q12 EPS estimate to $0.23 from $0.26 vs. consensus of $0.26. 
                                  Our EBITDA estimate is $9.3 million.     Our estimate assumes total sales increase 19.0% to 
                                  $118.1 million, driven by 9.0% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 75 
                                  bp to 27.2%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 22.5% to $22.9 million, or

                                  margins to 7.3%, or $8.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.3 million, a 20-bp expansion in 
                                  margin to 7.9%. We assume interest expense of $0.4 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.9 million 
                                  shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.23, a 18.4% increase from 2Q11.  

                                  In FY2012, we estimate EPS decreases to $0. 91 from $0.96. Consensus EPS is $0.95. Our 
                                  EBITDA estimate is $36.6 million.   Our estimate assumes total sales increase 15.2% to $461.0 
                                  million (vs. consensus of $459.0 million), with gross margins improving 67 bp to 27.0%. We

                                 forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) gr ow 16.6% to $87.8 million, a 24-bp year-over-
                                 year deterioration in margin, leading to a 39-bp improvement in operating margins to 7.4%, or 
                                 $34.1 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $36.6 million, a 44-bp improvement in margin to 
                                 7.9%. We assume interest expense of $1.8 million, a 41.1% tax rate and 20.9 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.91.  

                                 In 1Q12, CHEF reported EPS of $0.13, which missed our $0.14 estimate and consensus of 
                                 $0.16. Total sales increased 18.3% to $98.1 million. Gross margins improved 75 bp to 25.6%. 
                                 Operating expenses (excluding D&A) grew 22.1% to $20.4 million. Operating margins 
                                 expanded 21 bp to 5.2%, or $5.1 million, while EBITDA margins expanded 11 bp to 5.8%, or 
                                 $5.7 million. Interest expense came in at $0.6 million. Using a 41.6% tax rate and 20.9 million 
                                 shares outstanding gets us to EPS of $0.13.  

                                 Additional Takeaways  

                                    Management updated its FY2012 guidance to reflect EPS of $0.91-$0.94 and revenues of 
                                     $452-$462 million. 

                                    In 1Q12, organic sales slowed sequentially from 4Q; however, similar to last quarter we 
                                     believe this is a function of the Harry Wils  and Provvista acquisitions since CHEF was 
                                     taking share from these companies before they bought them. Additionally sales was also 
                                     negatively impacted by deflation in the dairy category, which began to occur in January and 
                                     persisted throughout the quarter, and the loss  of a drayage contract.  The drayage contract 
                                     was a one-off contract to accommodate a cust omer, and we are not surprised the company 
                                     discontinued this service since it does not fit within CHEFs current business model.  

                                    On acquisitions, the integration of the Harry Wils and Provvista Specialty Food 
                                     acquisitions remains on track.  

                                    In contrast to the casual dining segment, which saw sales deteriorate in March and further 
                                     into April, sales trends at fine dining restaurants (CHEFs core customer) held steady 
                                     throughout the entire quarter. 

                                    During 1Q, the company saw product placement and unique customer growth at levels 
                                     similar to FY2011. The company saw increased case volumes in all categories, but 
                                     particularly in dairy (which when combined with deflation caused some of the lighter than 
                                     expected sales growth). 

                                    On real estate, CHEF transitioned to a new, larger facility in Miami during 1Q, and recently 
                                     signed a lease for its new facility in the Bronx that will replace the two existing facilities. 

                                    In April, the company entered into a new credit facility that provides $180 million in 
                                     additional liquidity, comprising a $100-million cash flow revolver, $40-million term note 
                                     and $40-million accordion feature. 

                                    The loss of the drayage contract will cost the company $4 million in FY2012 revenues and 
                                     $0.02 in FY2012 EPS. Management expected to discontinue the contract in FY2013, and 
                                     was caught slightly off guard that it ended in FY2012.

SOFTER Q1 AND TEMPERED GUIDANCE, MAINTAIN BUY AND 

$24 TARGET  

Investment recommendation 
We expect that CHEF will deliver an EPS growth CAGR of over 20% over the next few years and has considerable 
geographic growth and consolidation opportunities to enhance strong organic growth within its existing markets. 

Investment highlights 
•   CHEF reported Q1 results below consensus forecasts as volume softened later in the quarter and dairy 
    deflation tempered revenue growth. Guidance was moderated for F2012 to reflect the Q1 and a customer 
    loss, offset by the benefits of the acquisition of Praml in the Las Vegas market. 

•   EPS was $0.13 vs. consensus of $0.15 and revenue was $98.1M vs. consensus of $93.3M. On top of the softer 
    trends in March and dairy deflation challenges, Q1 is a seasonally soft quarter. 

•   While March tends softened, internal growth was 7% and would have been modestly higher if not for 
    deflationary pricing in dairy as the quarter progressed. 

•   Margins remained strong despite the softening with gross margin up 10 bp to 26.6% and about 50 basis 
    point of leverage was experienced. 

•   Recently acquired Praml appears to be more profitable than we expected as the implied EBITDA is in line 
    with our expectations while revenue is lower than our initial guess. 

•   Revenue guidance was increased to a range of $452M-$462M from $450M-$460M, but including the Praml 
    acquisition, the guidance range is down about $10M. EPS guidance is tempered by $0.02 to $0.91-$0.94 
    from $0.91-$0.96 previously. We will adjust our forecasts for the Q1 trends and acquisition after further 
    follow-up on the quarter and trends. 

Valuation 
Shares trade at 22x F2013E EPS and about 11x EBITDA forecast, in line with its specialty and natural peers, but 
the valuation will likely lead to a correction on the softer revenue trends experienced in March, which could be 
exacerbated by recent insider selling. We maintain our $24 target and expect a correction off of this level today.

                               VALUATION 
                               Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 22x our 2012 EPS forecast 
                               and 11x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
                               premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples generally in the 
                               low teens on forward earnings and 7-8x EBITDA, the valuation is at a slight 
                               discount to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, 
                               United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $50.30 | Buy). We view UNFI as the best 
                               comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior 
                               margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18% UNFI’s gross margins are 
                               inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We continue 
                               to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
                               does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on 
                               invested capital.  

                               We maintain our price target of $24.00, which reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA 
                               forecast and 22x our 2013 EPS estimate, which is consistent with where CHEF 
                               currently trades prior to expected share price weakness today and reflect the 
                               premium valuations of the specialty food peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

•  A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
   excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several 
   years, could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major 
   products sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, 
   flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact 
   CHEF's operations. 

•  Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
   establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as 
   consumer confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding 
   incremental economic weakness have impacted the performance of the 
   shares. 

•  Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
   competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes 
   with larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include 
   Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

•  Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, 
   leaving the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 
   2010, 66% of CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

•  Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
   history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
   industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
   acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
   sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
   expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

•  Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and 
   any concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in 
   the brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always 
   present.  

•  Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
   state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution 
   operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also 
   subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a 
   distributor of specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing 
   governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the 
   sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   51

•  Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability 
   to profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could 
   result in its trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary 
   closure or the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

Additional Discussion 

EPS miss driven by a higher-than-forecasted expense ratio.  After the close on Thursday, May 
3, Chefs’ Warehouse reported that Q1’12 pro forma core (before nonrecurring items) EPS rose 
8% to $0.13 from $0.12 in the year-ago period; this was below our and the consensus $0.16 
forecast. Adjusted EBITDA gained 15.3% to $5.9M from $5.1M which missed consensus of $6.5M. 
Relative to our model, the miss resulted from higher-than-forecasted expense ratio of 21.4% 
versus  our  20.5%  estimate.  Sales  grew  17.9%  yr/yr  to  $98.1M  and  beat  our  16.1%  growth 
projection but missed consensus at up 19.3%. 
 
Unanticipated dairy deflation impacted sales and earnings.  Real internal sales gained an 
estimated 9%, which topped our 7.5% forecast, but unanticipated deflation in dairy items (about 
10% of total sales), caused price/mix to turn negative at (1.7%). Hence nominal internal sales 
rose 7.3% and missed our 9.5% forecast. Deflation, particularly in commoditized categories such 
as dairy, is a drag on distributors sales and earnings as lower prices are nearly immediately 
passed on to customers. 
 
2012 sales guidance boosted; high-end of EPS trimmed. Chefs’ adjusted 2012 pro forma core 
(before  nonrecurring  items)  EPS  guidance  to  $0.91-$0.94  (up  17%-21%  yr/yr)  from  prior 
guidance of $0.91-$0.96 but boosted total sales guidance to $452M-$462M (up 12.8%-15.3% 
yr/yr) versus prior guidance of $450M-$460M. 
 
Understanding  EPS  and  sales  guidance  updates.   Our  take  on  reconciling  the  change  in 
guidance is as follows: 
•   The unanticipated deflation in dairy items trimmed an estimated $0.01-$0.02 from EPS in 
    the quarter. 
•   The loss of drayage customer will trim $0.02 to EPS for the year. 
•   The recent acquisition of Praml will be accretive to EPS this year by about $0.01-$0.02. 
•   These three items net to a ($0.02) swing; thus the high end of the EPS guidance range was 
    brought down $0.02. 
 
•   Praml adds $12M to sales for the eight months of this year. 
•   Lower-than  anticipated  sales  on  dairy  deflation  annualizes  to  about  $6M  versus  prior 
    expectations 
•   The loss of the drayage customer trims $4M sales 
•   These three items net to a positive $2M swing; hence the $2M raise in sales guidance. 
          
Recent acquisitions performing very well; more to come . Based on information provided in 
its press release, CHEF’s two acquisitions that affected Q2 (Hary Wils and Provvista) contributed 
$0.9M in profit on $8.8M in sales for an approximate 10% contribution margin. 
 
Lowering EPS forecasts $0.03 (for Q1 miss).  For 2012, we forecast growth in sales of 15.6% 
(17.8% on an equal-weeks basis) to $463M (up from our prior $455.3M projection), in adjusted 
EBITDA of 19.3% to $37.3M (up from our prior $37.1M projection), and in pro forma EPS of 18% 
to $0.92 (trimmed by $0.03 from our prior $0.95 estimate). For 2013, we forecast growth in sales 
at  11.8%  to  $517.6M  (versus  our  prior  $503.1M  forecast),  in  adjusted  EBITDA  of  18.5%  to 
$44.1M (in line with our prior $44M estimate), and in EPS of 22% to $1.12. We project free cash 
flow/share at $0.45 for 2012 and $1.00 for 2013. 
 
Maintain Buy (1) rating and price target of $29.  We view Chefs’ as a compelling small cap 
growth investment. While its valuation has expanded, we still view it as reasonable. Specifically, 
Chefs’  forward  P/E  ratio  based  on  estimated  calendar  2012  EPS  at  26.1x  is  valued  at  a  7% 
discount to the BB&T Natural and Functional Food Merchandisers Index at 28x. Based on its 
favorable long-term growth outlook (see our April 17 note, “CEO Meetings Bolster Investment 
Case”), we would use any weakness to accumulate CHEF stock. 
 
Results in Detail 
 
Below we analyze Q1’12 versus Q1’11 on a pro forma basis to reflect the impact of Chefs’ IPO. 
Specific adjustments include the following: 
•   Material adjustments to year-ago interest expense assuming post-IPO financial leverage and 
    excluding debt refinancing costs 
•   Tax adjustment (assuming a 41% tax rate) to normalize the Q1’11 effective tax rate

Q1’12 sales grew 17.9% yr/yr to $98.1M on increased case volume and $8.8M of revenue related 
to acquisitions. Nominal internal sales rose 7.3% on real internal growth of 9% and inflation/mix 
of -1.7% while acquisitions contributed growth of 10.6%. 
 
Gross margin expanded 7 bps yr/yr to 26.56% versus our 26 bps forecast. Operating expenses 
increased 20.4% yr/yr while the corresponding ratio expanded 43 bps to 21.4% (versus our 47 
bps contraction forecast), driven largely by an increase in warehouse, distribution, and selling 
costs ($1.4M related to acquisitions). Operating margin thus contracted 36 bps yr/yr to 5.16% 
while the related profit dollars grew 10.1% to $5.1M. Adjusted EBITDA gained 15.3% to $5.9M 
from $5.1M. 
 
Net interest expense increased to $0.5M from $0.4M in the prior year period while other income 
was nil versus a gain of $0.1M in Q1’11. The effective tax rate expanded 120 bps to 41.61%, 
resulting in net income of $2.6M, up 4.2% yr/yr. 
 
Valuation Methodology & Risk Considerations 

Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF's could be revalued closer to the group 
average of 28x calendar 2012 EPS from 26.1x currently. However, we have retained our forward 
P/E valuation assumption at 25.3x, which we apply to our calendar 2013 EPS forecast of $1.12 to 
yield our $29 price target. We believe general risks to achieving our price target include lower-
than-forecasted  sales  and/or  earnings.  Specific  risks  relevant  to  Chefs'  Warehouse  include 
cyclicality of demand tied to high end consumer sentiment, concentration of business in greater 
New York, fuel price inflation, product cost inflation, and acquisition related risks.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating 
is determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to 
the 12-month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best 
estimate of the market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of 
numerous assumptions, including company,  industry,  and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and  relative 
basis, as well as investor sentiment, which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%     
 
NR: Not Rated                       NA:NR:NR:NR:NA: Not Applicable               NM:NA:NA:NM: Not Meaningful           SP:NM:NM:SP: Suspended SP:SP:
 
Stocks rated Buy (1) are required to have a published 12-month price target, while it is not required on stocks rated 
Hold (2) and Underweight (3).

INVESTMENT CONCLUSION 
CHEF reported another quarter of strong growth in both revenue and earnings, 
but it was below consensus. The stock is understandably under pressure on the 
results and trading lower at a higher rate than the reduction in the earnings 
outlook given the momentum that was present in the shares and the premium 
valuation. We view the correction as a healthy one as it reflects the stock, the 
valuation and short-term investor reactions rather than any material fundamental 
change. As such, it provides another opportunity to buy the shares at a discount 
to its best peer and with more modest expectations. Not only is the consensus EPS 
forecast moderating, but likely so is the expectation for upside that was present in 
the shares. We reiterate our BUY rating and recommend investors capitalize on 
what we believe is an attractive buying opportunity. 

THE RESULTS 
CHEF reported EPS of $0.13, compared to the consensus EPS estimate of $0.15. 
Revenue of $98.1M was about $1M below the forecast and was driven by both 
7.3% internal growth and the benefit of three acquisitions over the last 12 
months. Given the shortfall, even as modest as it was, our initial conclusion was 
that sales simply softened in March as one would understand given how the 
landscape has progressed this year. However, it appears that case volume did not 
indicate any change in the growth rate. The shortfall vs. expectations, and likely 
to management’s expectations entering the year, was driven by rapid deflation of 
dairy pricing during the quarter that should have led to slower revenue growth 
later in the quarter than at the onset. While the company held gross margin 
percentage at 26.6%, this of course implies lower gross margin dollar 
contribution. Given we must assume dairy pricing remains at the lower level, we 
are flowing this lower contribution into our remaining F2012 estimates. 
Additionally, the decision to not pursue an existing customer with less favorable 
pricing impacts the forward guidance. As a result of about a $0.02 impact from 
the lower dairy pricing and a $0.02 impact from the customer loss, the company 
lowered the high end of its EPS guidance range to $0.94 from $0.96. The 
guidance change is more modest than the called-out items, and likely benefits 
from a modest offset from the acquisition of Praml in Las Vegas. We are reducing 
our F2012 EPS estimate to $0.91 from $0.95 and our F2013 EPS estimate to 
$1.05 from $1.08 as a result of the recent revenue trends. Our revenue forecast, 
however, is increased to $461.1 million from $456.3 million in F2012 and to 
$514.3 million from $504.2 million in F2013. Our revenue forecast increase 
reflects the acquisition of Praml, which we haven’t forecasted adding to EPS yet.

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 19x our 2013 EPS forecast 
and 9x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples generally in the 
low teens on forward earnings and 7 to 8x EBITDA, the valuation is at a discount 
to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United 
Natural Foods. We view UNFI as the best comparison for CHEF given it also 
enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins relative to most distributors 
(yet at 18% UNFI’s gross margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader 
in its segment as is CHEF. We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a 
premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI does) given its vastly superior margins, 
growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital.  

We maintain our price target of $24.00, which reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA 
forecast and 22x our 2013 EPS estimate, which is consistent with where CHEF 
currently trades prior to expected share price weakness today and reflects the 
premium valuations of the specialty food peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, 
could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products 
sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and 
cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's 
operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer 
confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental 
economic weakness have impacted the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with 
larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. 
Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving 
the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of 
CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the 
brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations 
require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to 
similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of 
specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of 
and public awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and 
marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   69

the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 
In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

As is the case with all Jefferies employees, the analyst(s) responsible for the coverage of the financial instruments discussed in this report receives
compensation based in part on the overall performance of the firm, including investment banking income. We seek to update our research as
appropriate, but various regulations may prevent us from doing so. Aside from certain industry reports published on a periodic basis, the large majority
of reports are published at irregular intervals as appropriate in the analyst's judgement.
Jefferies Group, Inc. makes a market in the securities or ADRs of The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.
Jefferies Group, Inc., its affiliates or subsidiaries has acted as a manager or co-manager in the underwriting or placement of securities for The Chefs'
Warehouse, Inc. or one of its affiliates within the past twelve months.

Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.
Restricted - Describes issuers where, in conjunction with Jefferies engagement in certain transactions, company policy or applicable securities
regulations prohibit certain types of communications, including investment recommendations.
Monitor - Describes stocks whose company fundamentals and financials are being monitored, and for which no financial projections or opinions on
the investment merits of the company are provided.

Valuation Methodology
Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total
return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market
risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF,
P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns,
and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Conviction List Methodology
      1. The aim of the conviction list is to publicise the best individual stocks ideas from the Jefferies Global Research.

      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
         is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
         non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
         to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
         target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
         the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.
      8. The conviction list is published once a month whilst global equity markets are closed.
      9. Transaction fees are not included.
     10. All corporate actions are taken into account.

Risk which may impede the achievement of our Price Target
This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the
financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based
upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of
the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and
income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial
and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may
adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. In addition, investors in securities such
as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.

INVESTMENT THESIS 
We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a 
substantial growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal 
growth and acquisitions, as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and 
scale undoubtedly offers advantages. While the current momentum is obvious in 
the financial results and the geographical growth opportunity has been illustrated 
with strategic acquisitions over the last several years into new markets, we 
believe that the expansion opportunities in existing markets are not fully 
appreciated. We suspect that the catalyst for new product categories will occur in 
early 2013 when the company opens a new distribution center in New York. The 
facility will provide immediate efficiencies for CHEF’s largest market, but should 
also provide the capacity for expansion into large new categories, such as 
produce, seafood and cut meats. The category expansion opportunities could 
double the market opportunity for CHEF. 

The geographical growth opportunity is clear with CHEF operating in just seven 
markets today. However, the magnitude of the opportunity is larger than we had 
anticipated with the company targeting more major markets as viable entries 
than we’d assumed. Essentially every NFL city with the exception of Green Bay 
(although nearby Milwaukee would be served out of a Chicago entry) is a target 
that could support a Chef’s Warehouse entry. This implies more than a 
quadrupling of the current market presence (CHEF already operates in two non-
NFL cities: Los Angeles and Las Vegas). With acquisition opportunities in 
numerous new markets, yet still opportunities for tuck-ins to existing markets (as 
illustrated by the Las Vegas acquisition), the opportunity for growth through 
industry consolidation is significant. Beyond the simple math of new market 
opportunities, the benefits of scale from a true national presence have yet to even 
be realized and CHEF is already delivering strong gross and EBITDA margins. 

Given the inherent growth of specialty foods in all channels of distribution, 
CHEF’s ability to grow market share in existing markets through a superior 
offering and infrastructure, along with growth opportunities through both 
geographic and category expansion, should deliver a long-term double-digit 
growth opportunity that is measured in decades. We reiterate our BUY rating and 
$24 price target and confidently foresee an above-average growth rate that 
justifies the current valuation. 

VALUATION 
Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 22x our 2013 EPS forecast 
and 11x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples (generally in the 
low teens on forward earnings and 7-8x EBITDA), the valuation is essentially in-
line with its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, 

                                                                                   

                                                                                  84

                                              United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $49.29). We view UNFI as the best 
                                              comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior 
                                              margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18%, UNFI’s gross margins are 
                                              inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We continue 
                                              to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
                                              does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on 
                                              invested capital. 

                                              The shares are trading in line with our $24 price target, which is predicated on 
                                              the shares trading at about 11x F2013 EBITDA and is thus a near-term target. 
                                              We anticipate that share price appreciation should at least keep pace with 
                                              earnings and cash flow growth given our comfort with the current valuation on 
                                              the out year.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

•  A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
   excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several 
   years, could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major 
   products sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, 
   flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact 
   CHEF's operations. 

•  Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
   establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as 
   consumer confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding 
   incremental economic weakness have impacted the performance of the 
   shares. 

•  Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
   competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes 
   with larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include 
   Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

•  Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, 
   leaving the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 
   2010, 66% of CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

•  Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
   history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
   industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
   acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
   sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
   expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

•  Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and 
   any concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in 
   the brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always 
   present.  

•  Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
   state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution 
   operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also 
   subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a 
   distributor of specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing 
   governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the 
   sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   87

                                                                   1 May 2012 

                                                                                     
•  Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability 
   to profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could 
   result in its trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary 
   closure or the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

                                   Areas of focus for the conference call: 

                                           Cadence of sales throughout 1Q in light of some industry data pointing to weakening 
                                            sales in March. 

                                           Sales trends into 2Q12.  

                                           Updated guidance for FY2012. 

                                           The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact due to 
                                            acquisitions and inflation. In addition, some color on trends on unique customers. 

                                           FY2012 capex allocation  the companys 10-K indicated capex would be in the $12.2 
                                            million range in FY2012. 

                                           Update on the new facility that is expected to replace the two existing Bronx facilities. 

                                           Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                            operators that CHEF serves.  

                                           Color on top-line trends and the correlation with rising and falling gas prices.  

                                           Some thoughts on how the changing dynamics of the restaurant industry (smaller plate 
                                            sizes, high growth in tapas-style restaurants, as an example) affect CHEFs approach to 
                                            increasing market share.   

                                           Update on the rollout of engineered labor        standards to the companys facilities. 
                                            Previously, management indicated that the rollout would be complete for all facilities 
                                            except Miami and Portland by the conclusion of 1Q12.

                                        Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its 
                                         customers.  

                                        Trends in case volumes and revenues per case. 

                                        Managements thoughts on the opportunity for new market entries  specifically, how 
                                         many markets can the company ultimately enter and an outline of the criteria 
                                         management uses to evaluate potential markets. 

                                 Our 1Q12 EPS estimate remains at $0.14 vs. consensus of $0.16         . Our estimate assumes 
                                 total sales increase 19.0% to $98.7 million, driven by 9% organic sales growth, and we assume 
                                 gross margins expand 50bp to 26.3%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 
                                 20.8% to $20.2 million, or a 30bp increase as a pe rcentage of sales to 20.4%, leading to a 31bp 
                                 improvement in operating margins to 5.3%, or $5.2 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $5.9 
                                 million, a 20bp expansion in margin to 5.9%. We assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 
                                 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.14  a 12.2% 
                                 increase from 1Q11.  

                                 In FY2012, our estimate for EPS is $0.96. Consensus EPS is $0.95. Our EBITDA estimate 
                                 is $38 million . Our estimate assumes total sales increase 13.2% to $453.2 million (vs. 
                                 consensus of $459.0 million), with gross margins improving 49bp to 26.8%. We forecast 
                                 operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 11.9  % to $84.3 million, a 21bp year over year 
                                 improvement in margin  leading to a 65bp improvement in operating margins to 7.7%, or 
                                 $34.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $38 million, a 70bp improvement in margin to 8.2%. 
                                 We assume interest expense of $0.8 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.96.

Additional Discussion 

We recently hosted investor meetings with CEO Christopher Pappas on the west coast.  This note 
contains two analytic sections with bullish implications for both the near- and long- term, in our 
view. First, we present meeting takeaways organized around three key fundamentals; organic 
growth, acquisitions and margin management largely focused on the near term. Second, from a 
longer term perspective, we analyze what Chefs’ Warehouse might look like in three years time 
under the assumption of a meaningful acceleration in the historical rate of acquisitions. 
 
Overall,  our  critical  takeaway  is  that  Chefs’  is  well  positioned  to  accelerate  growth  through 
acquisition due to the convergence of scalability (e.g., best-of-breed I/T and management) with 
opportunity (e.g., interested sellers and capital access). As more fully detailed below, we present 
a  scenario  analysis  which  assumes  that  during  the  next  three  years  CHEF  consummates  10 
acquisitions that average $25M in revenue and can reach profitability about in line with profit 
center average (i.e., pre-corporate expenses).  Under these assumptions, sales and EBITDA can 
more than double in that time frame from calendarized 2011 results.  Based on valuations that 
imbed 10% to 20% discounts to the current EV/EBITDA multiple CHEF’s stock price at the end of 
2014 would be in a range of $45-$52, up 87% to 116% in total if this scenario were to occur.  
Clearly, we believe, this scenario would take longer to play out if Chefs’ did not accelerate its 
acquisition activity at the pace we have assumed. 
 
We have not changed our sales and earnings estimates at this time since we do not model for 
unannounced acquisitions. But we view this analysis as indicative of the potential upside to long-
term   fundamentals   for   CHEF   if   its   acquisition   driven   growth   component   accelerates 
meaningfully.  Thus, we have raised our 12-month price target to $29 from $24, which retains the 
current  forward  P/E  multiple  (previously  we  had  contracted  the  multiple  for  the  sake  of 
conservatism). 

Near Term Outlook Remains Strong 

Below we present details of key fundamental takeaways.  First, Chefs’ organic growth remains 
strong based on significant penetration opportunities with existing customers and healthy new 
customer  demand.    Second,  the  acquisition  outlook  appears  robust  in  Chefs’  sweet  spot  of 
distributors with $10M-$40M in annual revenues, of  which  there are some 2,000 in the U.S.   
Third, Chefs’ margins should remain stable, even as it acquires lower volume operators (with 
lower  operating  margins),  as  we  anticipate  significant  synergies  will  be  achieved  in  both 
operations and sales productivity. 
 
Meeting takeaway #1: Organic growth outlook remains strong 
•   From a facilities standpoint, once the Bronx distribution center is completed next year, CHEF 
    will have capacity to double sales from the current infrastructure.  
•   Chefs’ faces normal sales volume attrition of about 7% annually due to leases expiring and 
    customer   credit   issues   that   must   be   overcome   with   unique   placement   gains   (i.e., 
    penetration) and new customer wins. 
•   Increased sales penetration and new customers are driven by superior selection with over 
    10,000  items  versus  1,000  to  1,500  for  a  typical  competitor.  Examples  of  category 
    dominance include some 120 olive oils ranging from $30 per liter to $3 per liter, and 800 
    cheeses at $30 per pound for artisanal Sonomas to commodity parmesans at $5 per pound. 
•   In New York the average customer purchases 21 line items while in less mature markets the 
    average customer purchases 11 line items. 
•   In  terms  of  new  customers,  Chefs’  has  received  more  than  2,000  credit  applications 
    suggesting its flow of interest remains strong. 
•   Currently,  the  total  sales  force  is  about  150  but  Chefs’  needs  more  street  reps  to  boost 
    penetration. The goal is to add up to 30 additional sales associates to fully cover the current 
    customer base. 
•   While the higher end restaurant environment is not back to the boom times a la 1999, a 
    decent recovery has taken hold.  In particular, corporate spending has not fully recovered. 
     
 
Meeting takeaway #2: Acquisition driven growth appears set to accelerate 
•   Chefs’ sweet spot for acquisitions is revenues in the $10M-$40M range, of which there are 
    some 2,000 foodservice distributors in the U.S.  CHEF generally pays 3x-5x EV/EBITDA (post 
    cost synergies as purchasing, human resources, payroll, IT, and finance are centralized). A 
    20%-30% sales loss is budgeted but Provvista in Portland, OR, had none while Harry Wils 
    was in line with expectations. 

                                                                                           2 of 7 

                                                                                                    101

•    Acquired distributors typically stock 1,000 to 1,500 SKUs; Chefs’ adds 20%-30% a year and 
    trains the sales force to dramatically increase penetration at acquired businesses. 
•    The current potential interest pipeline is fuller than expected at initial public offering due to 
    a   combination   of   fear   of   Chefs’   potential   entry   and   previous   relationships   with 
    entrepreneurs now in their fifties and sixties, who often have no succession plans.  
•    Major   targeted   markets   for   geographic   expansion   include   Boston,   Chicago,   Denver, 
    Philadelphia, Phoenix, Seattle and Texas.  Management is very opportunistic in its execution 
    making it nearly impossible to predict which market(s) it will enter in the near term. 
•    Targeted categories for product expansion include proteins (hormone and antibiotic free 
    meat and seafood), produce and pastry.  Gross margin in produce is near corporate average 
    while proteins are below at about 20% but contribution dollars per case is greater than 
    corporate average. 
•    Chefs’ has passed on deals in new markets in particular due to bad management and for 
    those firms that may operate in a grey area (e.g., mixing purity levels of olive oil without 
    proper label disclosure). 
 
Meeting takeaway #3: Margins should be stable 
•    Chefs’ approach to vendor relations is more about building relationships than squeezing the 
    lowest price since product supply is the ultimate differentiation. 
•    Centralized procurement produces better inventory control and scalable efficiencies. 
•    Roadnet  has  increased  delivery  windows  and  on-time  accuracy,  while  voice  picking  has 
    reduced mis-labels and shortages. 
•    Chefs’  price  optimization  software  allows  its  sales  reps  to  dynamically  price  orders  by 
    comparing prices to similar restaurants in a particular market. 
•    Fuel  surcharges  force  order  consolidation  by  customers  which  hurts  smaller  firms  but 
    benefits Chefs’. 
•    Investment that will partly offset scale efficiencies include hiring additional sales associates, 
    expanding and retrofitting warehouses, and investment needs of acquisitions. 

Long Term Could be Stronger Yet 

We believe that Chefs’ is well positioned to accelerate growth through acquisition due to the 
convergence of scalability with opportunity.  Figure 1  shows our three year sales build.    We 
assume Chefs’ completes ten acquisitions over the next three years that average $25M in sales 
per acquisition.  Based on these acquisitions and organic growth, we forecast revenue growth of 
104% to $800M in 2014, or 27% annually compounded during the next three years.

Figure 2  details our three year EBITDA build.  We assume that Chefs’ finances ten acquisitions at 
an average of 0.44x EV/sales, equating to $110M net new debt (we assume all debt financing).  
Based on a 9% EBITDA margin (our current 2013 forecast is 8.75%) we project EBITDA growth 
of 135% to $72M in 2014, or 33% annually compounded during the next three years.

Figure 3 shows our three year cumulative free cash flow projection.  We forecast that Chefs’ will

and assume the company will use its free cash flow to pay down debt.

Figure 4 shows our three year net debt build.  We assume Chefs’ will use $110M to finance the 
acquisitions and $70M of free cash flow to pay down debt.  Based on these assumptions, we 
forecast Chefs’ net debt of $88M at the end of 2014.

In  Figure 5  we derive hypothetical price targets based on the above three-year fundamental 
projections and assumed valuation levels.  Our key assumptions are that valuation levels will 
contract (based on EV/LTM EBITDA) from 10% to 20% from the current 18x EV/LTM EBITDA.  If 
the EV/LTM EBITDA valuation contracted 10% to 16.25x then we estimate CHEF’s share price 
would climb to $52 by the end of 2014 for a total return of 116%. If EV/LTM EBITDA contracted 
20% to 14.25x (which is UNFI’s current EV/LTM EBITDA multiple) then we believe CHEF’s stock 
price would advance 87% to $45 by the end of 2014.

Valuation Methodology & Risk Considerations 

Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF's could be revalued closer to the group 
average of 27x calendar 2012 EPS from 25.3x currently. However, for the sake of conservatism, 
we have retained our forward P/E valuation assumption at 25.3x, which we apply to our calendar 
2013 EPS forecast of $1.15 to yield our $29 price target. We believe general risks to achieving our 
price target include lower-than-forecasted sales and/or earnings. Specific risks relevant to Chefs' 
Warehouse include cyclicality of demand tied to high end consumer sentiment, concentration of 
business in greater New York, fuel price inflation, product cost inflation, and acquisition related 
risks.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating 
is determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to 
the 12-month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best 
estimate of the market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of 
numerous assumptions, including company,  industry,  and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and  relative 
basis, as well as investor sentiment, which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%

Stocks rated Buy (1) are required to have a published 12-month price target, while it is not required on stocks rated 
Hold (2) and Underweight (3).

      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
         is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
         non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
         to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
         target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
         the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and scale undoubtedly offers 
advantages. Our thesis was further supported last week as we hosted the company for two 
days of investor meetings. While the current momentum is obvious in the financial results 
and the geographical growth opportunity has been illustrated with strategic acquisitions 
over the last several years into new markets, we believe that the expansion opportunities 
in existing markets are not fully appreciated. We suspect that the catalyst for new product 
categories will occur in early 2013 when the company opens a new distribution center in 
New York. The facility will provide immediate efficiencies for CHEF’s largest market, but 
should also provide the capacity for expansion into large new categories, such as produce, 
seafood and cut meats. The category expansion opportunities could double the market 
opportunity for CHEF. 

The geographical growth opportunity is clear with CHEF operating in just seven markets 
today. However, the magnitude of the opportunity is larger than we had anticipated with 
the company targeting more major markets as viable entries than we’d assumed. 
Essentially every NFL city with the exception of Green Bay (although nearby Milwaukee 
would be served out of a Chicago entry) is a target that could support a Chef’s Warehouse 
entry. This implies more than a quadrupling of the current market presence (CHEF already 
operates in two non-NFL cities: Los Angeles and Las Vegas). With acquisition opportunities 
in numerous new markets, yet still opportunities for tuck-ins to existing markets, the 
opportunity for growth through industry consolidation is significant. Beyond the simple 
math of new market opportunities, the benefits of scale from a true national presence have 
yet to even be realized and CHEF is already delivering strong gross and EBITDA margins. 

Given the inherent growth of specialty foods in all channels of distribution, CHEF’s ability 
to grow market share in existing markets through a superior offering and infrastructure, 
along with growth opportunities through both geographic and category expansion, should 
deliver a long-term double-digit growth opportunity that is measured in decades. We 
reiterate our BUY rating and $24 price target and confidently foresee an above-average 
growth rate that justifies the current valuation. 

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 23x our 2012 EPS forecast and 11x 
our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
traditional food distribution peer group multiples (generally in the low teens on forward 
earnings and 7-8x EBITDA), the valuation is at a slight discount to its best and only real 
comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : 
$47.12). We view UNFI as the best comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally 
growing market, superior margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18%, UNFI’s gross 
margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We 
continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on invested 
capital.  

                                                                                           

                                                                                          113

                                                                Daily Letter |   3 
                                                                      26 March 2012 

                                                                                            
We maintain our price target of $24.00, which reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast and 
22x our 2013 EPS estimate, which is consistent with where CHEF currently trades on 
forward EBITDA and reflects the premium valuations of the specialty food peer group. 

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 
•   A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
    commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
    consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have 
    had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. 
    Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 
•   Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, 
    the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and 
    spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness 
    have impacted the performance of the shares. 
•   Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in 
    the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies 
    with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and 
    United Natural Foods. 
•   Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
    Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's 
    total sales originated from the New York market.  
•   Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history 
    and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is 
    highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
    acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of 
    key personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or 
    distribution gains.  
•   Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
    concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands 
    sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  
•   Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state 
    and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require 
    various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar 
    regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food 
    products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public 
    awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and 
    organic products 
•   Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
    profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its 
    trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the 
    destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 
In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

                                      We are raising our price target to $26, 15% upside from Fridays close                    . Our new price 
                                      target values CHEF on a FY13 EV/EBITDA of 12.0x. We believe valuing CHEF on FY13 is 
                                      more appropriate given several one-time cost headwinds in FY12. The FY13 multiple may 
                                      appear generous on the surface, but given the           significant opportunities  to continue growing 
                                      share, gain efficiencies, and grow earnings, we believe the multiple is warranted.

                                      I. Several headwinds should abate in FY13  leading us to raise our EPS estimate by 
                                      $0.04.  In FY12, we are looking for a 24% increase in EPS despite approximately $0.09 in 
                                      incremental costs associated with 1) an estimat          ed 20% increase in diesel costs ($0.02 with 
                                      diesel remaining at current levels), 2) incremental costs associated with SOX compliance 
                                      ($0.05), and 3) a 41% tax rate versus the 39.5% reported in FY11 ($0.02). (The company will 
                                      also incur costs associated with duplicate rent   with no corresponding revenue at the second 
                                      facility of $0.03 but these costs are excluded from our FY12 EPS.) Excluding these one-
                                      times, we would have been looking for a 36% increase in EPS. In FY13, while diesel costs are 
                                      likely to remain high, it seems unlikely diesel will  increase as much as the increase experienced 
                                      in the first part of this year, costs associated  with SOX compliance are  likely to linger but not 
                                      increase, the second facility in New York will come on line and will generate incremental 
                                      revenues and efficiency savings, and the tax rate will remain flat at 41%  so EPS will no 
                                      longer be pressured by these headwinds. As a result, our upwardly revised EPS of $1.17  up 
                                      22% from FY12  appears conservative relative to the companys core EPS growth in FY12.

                                      although excluded from the published report (because we were restricted on the name at 
                                      the time)  ranked #2 in our coverage universe              . Our rankings looked at a wide range of 
                                      metrics including Debt/EBITDAR, top-line growth, EBITDA margins, ROIC, valuation and 
                                      free cash flow yield. The company with the best  metric in each category received 14 points, the 
                                      worst received one point and the re sults were tallied. CHEF recei ved a total of  57 points, and

                                                         but on ROIC, leverage, and free cash flow yield, CHEF ranked slightly below SYY. CHEFs 
                                                         valuation is also richer than SYY and this metric hurt CHEFs ranking.

BMO Capital Markets                                                                                           Chefs' Warehouse 
                                   
                                      a)   Several initiatives are underway to continue to gain share organically          . These 
                                           initiatives include expanding the sales force, targeting a wider range of restaurant 
                                           formats, and partnering with vendors to increase product penetration in specific 
                                           categories. As indicated on the 4Q call, the company is currently focused on expanding 
                                           the sales force (a 15% increase in FY12) in order to increase penetration with existing 
                                           accounts (penetration of 1,00 0 SKUs per customer is considered underpenetrated) as 
                                           well as gain traction with new accounts. In   addition, the companys goal is to assign 
                                           each sales person 65 accounts. Today, the num ber skews considerably higher  leading 
                                           to a less effective selling effort. With the   expanded sales force, the company should 
                                           gain more traction on gaining a greater share of wallet with both new and existing 
                                           customers. In addition, we believe CHEF will continue to evolve and refine its 
                                           definition of the target market as the in dustry evolves. As an example, the company 
                                           had previously focused primarily on the $15 or  higher plate  but the trend to offer 
                                           smaller plates (or Tappas) has recently accelerated (in part due to persistent inflation in 
                                           protein) and CHEF recognizes that this format represents a significant growth 
                                           opportunity. Lastly, more recently, the company began pa  rtnering with select (smaller) 
                                           specialty vendors to meet with existing customers in an effort to increase penetration of 
                                           a particular product category. These vendors lack the ability to scale up to sell their 
                                           product with an internally developed sales force (i.e., small producers in Europe), so by 
                                           partnering with CHEF, the vendor is introduced to a national customer base through 
                                           CHEF relationships. In exchange for the introduction, the vendor provides (and pays 
                                           for) both a representative and the inventory  and both the vendor representative and 
                                           the CHEF sales representative will meet with a wide range of accounts to introduce the 
                                           product. This initiative (while in the early  stages) has been extremely successful so far 
                                           because the vendor specialist provides more immediate credibility on the quality of a 
                                           particular product, as a result, the effort has,  so far, resulted in both an uptick in initial 
                                           sales as well as higher order retention. 

                                      b)  Acquisitions remain a significant area of focus (although our FY13 estimates do not 
                                           reflect incremental revenues associated with  acquisitions)  and we continue to see 
                                           significant opportunities to gain share through select, accretive acquisitions of specialty 
                                           distributors in both existing and new geographies (e.g., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
                                           Atlanta). We also believe product line extensions (focusing initially on protein, 
                                           followed by produce) represent a signific  ant area of opportunity once the company 
                                           gains excess capacity at the new facility in New York. We believe management is 
                                           generally agnostic on product category versus  geographic expansion  as long as both 
                                           are accretive. The goal is to build the brand and gain share. 

                                      c)  Longer term, we believe the CW brand could ultimately encompasses a: Chefs 
                                           Warehouse Protein division (with separate invoices and credit terms), a Chef Direct 
                                           division for online purchases, a Chef Outlet  similar to the Restaurant Depot 
                                           concept  but with CHEFs emphasis on specialty, gourmet and import (Restaurant 
                                           Depot tends to skew more towards basic food products as well as sundry and 
                                           equipment),  and even the potential to develop product line extensions for some of the 
                                           companys more established restaurant chai ns (and chefs). Some of these goals are

                                           clearly long term in nature but they all speak to managements commitment to build a 
                                           brand and become a dominant force in the specialty distribution space.  

                                      II. Initiatives to drive greater efficiencies include the following:  

                                      a) Transitioning to the new facility in New York. This will drive significant cost savings 
                                      because under the current configuration the co mpany operates two facilities. The existing 
                                      facilities are extremely inefficient due to capac ity constraints and both facilities incur rent 
                                      and general overhead expenses. With the new facility, total rent expense should remain 
                                      more or less unchanged (because the new facility   is larger, and lease rates will likely be 
                                      higher), utility expenses should decline, but the company should gain significant cost 
                                      savings due to improved efficiency.  

                                      b) Once the transition is complete, the company should be able to implement more effective 
                                      labor management tools at the new facility. The current facility is too antiquated and 
                                      strained to fully utilize the tools associated with the roll-out of the system. 

                                      c) In 3Q11, the company introduced a price       optimization tool to the sales force  this 
                                      should help improve the companys selling efforts and also preserve (or improve) product 
                                      margins. 

                                      III. The transition to the new facility in New York should be completed by mid 2013         .  
                                      The company then plans to sublease the current,  larger facility for the duration of the lease 
                                      (expiring in 2014). The lease on CHEFs smaller facility expires mid 2013. Higher 
                                      depreciation associated with the facility could impact EPS by $0.02-$0.035 ($~12 million 
                                      depreciated over the initial life of the lease  excluding renewal options)  but the new 
                                      facility will dramatically improve efficiencies and reduce significant duplicate costs 
                                      (largely rent and utilities)  more than offsetting the negative earnings impact from higher 
                                      depreciation. Execution risk with the transition will be low, in our view, given the new 
                                      facilitys proximity to the existing facilities  and this proximity (resulting in ease of 
                                      transition) was one of the companys primary considerations in remaining in New York.  

                                      IV. Higher fuel costs will likely impact EPS by $0.02 in FY12 assuming fuel remains 
                                      near current levels. The negative impact to EPS reflects a slight delay in passing on 
                                      fuel surcharges in the early part of the fiscal year    . Inbound freight costs should also 
                                      increase but will likely have no impact to earnings because product costs are fully landed 
                                       so inventory costs already reflect inbound transportation costs. Going forward, if fuel 
                                      continues to rise, we believe management will be more proactive on immediately 
                                      increasing the surcharge in order to mitigate an additional impact to EPS.

of reports are published at irregular intervals as appropriate in the analyst's judgement.

Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.
Restricted - Describes issuers where, in conjunction with Jefferies engagement in certain transactions, company policy or applicable securities
regulations prohibit certain types of communications, including investment recommendations.
Monitor - Describes stocks whose company fundamentals and financials are being monitored, and for which no financial projections or opinions on
the investment merits of the company are provided.

Valuation Methodology
Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total
return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market
risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF,
P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns,
and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Conviction List Methodology
      1. The aim of the conviction list is to publicise the best individual stocks ideas from the Jefferies Global Research.
      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
          is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
          non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
          to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
          target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
          the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.
      8. The conviction list is published once a month whilst global equity markets are closed.
      9. Transaction fees are not included.
     10. All corporate actions are taken into account.

Risk which may impede the achievement of our Price Target
This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the
financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based
upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of
the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and
income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial
and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may
adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. In addition, investors in securities such
as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.

                                    We introduce our 1Q12 estimate at EPS of $0.14 and EBITDA of $5.8 million.                Our estimate 
                                    assumes total sales increase 19.0% to $98.7 million  driven by 9% organic sales growth, and 
                                    we assume gross margins expand 50bp to 26.3  %. We forecast operating expenses (excluding 
                                    D&A) grow 20.8% to $20.2 million, or a 30bp           increase as a percentage of sales to 20.4%  
                                    leading to a 31bp improvement in operating margins to 5.3%, or $5.2 million. This gets us to 
                                    EBITDA of $5.8 million, a 20bp expansion in margin to 5.9%. We assume interest expense of 
                                    $0.2 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of 
                                    $0.14  a 12.2% increase from 1Q11.  

                                    In FY2012, our estimate for EP S decreases to $0.96 from $0.99. Consensus EPS is $0.97. 
                                    Our EBITDA estimate is $37.1 million         . Our estimate assumes total sales increase 13.2% to 
                                    $453.2 million (vs. consensus of $441.7 million), with gross margins improving 49bp to 26.8%. 
                                    We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 11.9% to $84.3 million, a 21bp year 
                                    over year improvement in margin  leading to a 65bp improvement in operating margins to 
                                    7.7%, or $34.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $37.1 million, a 70bp improvement in 
                                    margin to 8.2%. We assume interest expense of $0.8 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million 
                                    shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.96.  

                                    In 4Q11, CHEF reported an EPS of $0.25, or $0.26 when using a tax rate of 41.0%. 
                                    Adjusted EPS was in line with our $0.26 estimate and slightly higher than consensus of 
                                    $0.25 . Total sales increased 27.2% to $116.5 million. Gross margins improved 64bp to 26.6%. 
                                    Operating expenses (excluding D&A) grew 25.5% to $20.8 million. Operating margins 
                                    expanded 124bp to 8.3%, or $9.7 million, while EBITDA margins expanded 88bp to 8.8%, or 
                                    $10.2 million. Interest expense came in at $0.5 million. Using a 41% tax rate and 20.8 million 
                                    shares outstanding gets us to EPS of $0.26.

                                    In 4Q11, the organic growth rate optically appeared to have slowed sequentially  but we 
                                      believe the deceleration was primarily a function of an ongoing shift in the composition of 
                                      the top line. Specifically, the acquisition component of the 4Q top-line accelerated to reflect 
                                      share gains within the Harry Wils acquisition as well as the more recent Provvista Specialty 
                                      Foods acquisition. Organic case volume trends remain robust. 

                                    Acquisitions and organic growth are expected to account for ~8% and ~9% of top-line 
                                      growth respectively, while inflation is expected to remain flat. 

                                    Operating expense margins should remain in the 19% range excluding duplicate rent. 

                                    Product cost inflation was in the ~4.3% range in 4Q11, but after factoring in the mix shift 
                                      (due to much stronger sales in dairy  a deflationary category in 4Q11) it was only 1.1%. 

                                    FY2012 guidance reflects flat inflation. 

                                    FY2012 guidance reflects $4.40-$4.50 fuel costs and the higher year-over-year fuel prices 
                                      negatively impact EPS by $0.02. 

                                    If fuel costs were to climb to the $5 range  EPS would be affected by an additional $0.02. 

                                    Engineered labor standards will be implemented at all facilities by 1Q12 with the exception 
                                      of the new Miami facility. The company intends to implement engineered labor standards at 
                                      Miami after 1Q12, with a Portland implementation scheduled shortly thereafter.

Additional Discussion 

EPS beat driven by higher-than-forecasted operating margin.  After the close on Tuesday, 
March 6, Chefs’ Warehouse reported that 14-week Q4’11 pro forma core (before nonrecurring 
items) EPS climbed 44% to $0.26 from $0.18 in the 13-week year-ago period; this beat our and 
the consensus’ $0.25 forecast (on an equal-weeks basis EPS were $0.24, up 33%).  Relative to our 
model, the upside resulted from higher-than-forecasted operating margin of 8.48% versus our 
7.64% estimate, as both gross margin and operating expenses were much better than forecasted.  
The tax rate at 41.5% exceeded our 39% forecast, and trimmed a penny from EPS. 
 
Top-line growth remained strong.  Sales grew 27.2% yr/yr to $116.5M in Q4, driven by 10% 
internal sales gains (8.9% from volume and 1.1% from price/mix), 10% from acquisitions and 
7.2% from the extra week.  Chefs’ top-line growth matched our $116.4M estimate and beat the 
consensus’ 23.6% forecast.  On an equal-weeks basis, Q4’11 sales increased 20%.  
 
Recent acquisitions performing very well; more to come.  Based on information provided in 
its press release, these two acquisitions contributed $1.1M in profit on $9.2M in sales for an 
approximate 12% contribution margin.  Management noted that the formerly New Jersey-based 
Harry Wils has met expectations and the recent investments in fleet and extra routes are driving 
business.  In  addition,  Portland,  OR-based  Provvista  Specialty  Foods  customer  retention  has 
exceeded expectations. Chefs’ plans to grow sales at Provvista via customer penetration as it 
brings  in  its  fuller  lines  of  product  and  by  winning  new  customers.    Chefs’  has  boosted  its 
technology  capital  spending  to  more  efficiently  and  effectively  integrate  recent  and  future 
acquisitions. 
 
2012  guidance  introduced.    Chefs’  established  2012  pro  forma  core  (before  nonrecurring 
items) EPS guidance at $0.91-$0.96 (up 17%-23% yr/yr) on total sales of $450M-$460M (up 
12.3%-14.8%  yr/yr).    This  includes  a  tax  rate  of  41% (we were  using  39%)  that  negatively 
impacts EPS by some $0.03. 
 
Boosting sales and adjusted EBITDA estimates; trimming 2012 EPS forecast for tax rate. 
For 2012, we forecast growth in sales of 13.7% (16.1% on an equal-weeks basis) to $455.3M (up 
from our prior $440.5M projection), in adjusted EBITDA of 18.8% to $37.1M (up from our prior 
$36.1M projection), and in pro forma EPS of 22% to $0.95 (trimmed by $0.02 from our prior 
$0.97 estimate).  For 2013, we forecast growth in sales at 10.5% to $503.1M (versus our prior 
$486.8M forecast), in adjusted EBITDA of 18.5% to $44M (up from our prior $42.3M estimate), 
and in EPS of 21% to $1.15.  We project free cash flow/share at $0.50 for 2012 and $1.00 for 
2013.  
   
Maintain Buy (1) rating and boosting price target to $24. We continue to view Chefs’ as a 
compelling small cap growth equity investment. While its valuation has expanded, we still view it 
as reasonable. Specifically, Chefs’ forward P/E ratio based on estimated calendar 2012 EPS at 
22.4x is valued at an 11% discount to the BB&T Natural and Functional Food Merchandisers 
Index at 25.2x. Further, its forward PEG (P/E to long-term growth rate) at 1.12x is currently at a 
15% discount to the group median of 1.31x. 

Results in Detail 

Below we analyze Q4’11 versus the Q4’10 on a pro forma basis to reflect the impact of Chefs’ 
recent IPO.  Specific adjustments include the following:  
•   Material   adjustments   to   interest   expense   assuming   post-IPO   financial   leverage   and 
    excluding debt refinancing costs (applied to Q4’10 only) 
•   Tax adjustment (assuming a 41% tax rate) to normalize the Q4’10 effective tax rate  
 
Q4’11 sales grew 27.2% yr/yr to $116.5M on increased case volume, higher revenue per case, 
and $9.2M of revenue related to acquisitions; excluding the additional week, sales climbed 20%.  
Nominal internal sales rose 10% on real internal growth of 8.9% and inflation/mix of 1.1% while 
acquisitions contributed 10% growth on an equal-weeks basis.   
 
Gross margin expanded 64 bps yr/yr to 26.62% versus our 16 bps forecast.  Operating expenses 
increased 21.4% yr/yr while the corresponding ratio contracted 87 bps to 18.14% (versus our 
51 bps forecast), driven by leveraging strong sales growth. Operating margin thus expanded 152 
bps yr/yr to 8.48% while the related profit dollars soared 55% to $9.9M.  Net interest expense 
increased to $0.5M from $0.2M while other income was nil versus a loss of $0.3M in Q4’10.  The 
effective tax rate expanded 50 bps to 41.5%, resulting in net income of $5.5M, up 43% yr/yr.

Valuation Methodology & Risk Considerations 

We generally apply forward P/E valuation methods to growth stocks, and we certainly view 
Chefs' that way.  Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF's could be revalued 
closer to the group average of 25.2x calendar 2012 EPS from 22.4x currently. However, for the 
sake of conservatism, we have contracted our forward P/E valuation assumption by 1.4x to 21x, 
which we apply it to our calendar 2013 EPS forecast of $1.15 to yield our $24 price target. We 
believe general risks to achieving our price target include lower-than-forecasted sales and/or 
earnings. Specific risks relevant to Chefs' Warehouse include cyclicality of demand tied to high 
end consumer sentiment, concentration of business in greater New York, fuel price inflation, 
product cost inflation, and acquisition related risks.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating 
is determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to 
the 12-month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best 
estimate of the market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of 
numerous assumptions, including company,  industry,  and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and  relative 
basis, as well as investor sentiment, which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%     
 
NR: Not Rated                       NA:NR:NR:NR:NA: Not Applicable               NM:NA:NA:NM: Not Meaningful           SP:NM:NM:SP: Suspended SP:SP:
 
Stocks rated Buy (1) are required to have a published 12-month price target, while it is not required on stocks rated 
Hold (2) and Underweight (3).

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and scale undoubtedly offers 
advantages. While the company is a relatively recent IPO and still establishing a reputation 
with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry and already proven investor 
concerns of cyclicality are unwarranted. We simply believe that if CHEF can achieve the 
top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, it can replicate 
this success in any major market. There is no market in the US with a larger base of menu-
driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging logistical 
environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food palates 
anywhere in the country. With an expertise in leveraging its supplier and sourcing 
relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or more readily available 
list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and tangible proof that it can 
dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there is ample reason to be 
comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success into a geographical growth opportunity 
that should ensure ample opportunity for consistent long-term growth. 

Q4 RESULTS 

CHEF reported Q4 results last night that exceeded both our and consensus expectations. 
Revenues increased 27.2% to $116.5 million vs. our and consensus estimates of $107.8 
million and $113.2 million, respectively, as higher-than-forecast organic growth along with 
stronger sales performance from recent acquisitions of Provvista and Harry Wils delivered 
upside. Excluding these two acquisitions, which added $9.2 million, as well as a fourteenth 
week in the quarter that contributed $6.6 million, CHEF posted a 9% organic growth rate 
vs. our 7% estimate.  

Gross margin continued to expand YOY, coming in at 26.6% vs. our 26.3% estimate, and 
we think the stronger margins are likely to continue. Given CHEF’s performance with 
optimizing pricing and delivering margin enhancement, we have increased our forward 
estimates for gross margin to the mid-26% range. Pro forma operating margin for the 
quarter was also quite strong, having posted a 180 basis point YOY increase to 8.5%, 
which was above our forecast of 8.1% given the aforementioned gross margin 
performance, and the higher sales volumes aided expense leverage. On a GAAP basis, 
earnings for the quarter came in at $0.25. On an adjusted basis, EPS were $0.26, which 
was ahead of the consensus forecast of $0.25 and our $0.24 estimate.  The Q4 results were 
strong across the board and add to our confidence in our F2012 forecasts for growth and 
margin performance.

                                                    For F2012, initial guidance was given with revenues in the range of $450 million to $460 
                                                    million and GAAP EPS of $0.88 to $0.93. Within the 16%-18% implied revenue increase, it 
                                                    is expected that roughly 8% come through acquisition and there is no adjustment for 
                                                    inflation, which is likely to add to sales growth. The pro forma EPS range given was for 
                                                    between $0.91 and $0.96, and the $0.03 differential between the two guidance ranges 
                                                    reflect an anticipated impact from duplicate rent and lease fees for a new NYC distribution 
                                                    center that should be announced over the next quarter and placed into service in F2013. 
                                                    We added in these non-recurring costs beginning in Q2.

ESTIMATE REVISIONS 

Following Q4 financial results, we are updating our forecasts for the upside and 
momentum heading into F2012. We are making no change to F2012 EPS estimate of $0.95 
as a 15 basis point impact from higher fuel costs and an increased effective tax rate 
assumption of 41% from 39% (trims $0.03 of EPS) offset our increased revenue forecasts. 
The company is also targeting higher operating expenses than we had forecasted, but this 
reinvestment is mostly offset by a stronger gross margin assumption. Our F2012 revenue 
forecast is increasing by approximately $14 million to $456 million to account for the 
stronger-than-expected internal growth rate and better performance from recently 
acquired businesses. For F2013, we are again maintaining our EPS estimates while 
increasing revenue to $504.2 million from $479.5 million.

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 22.5x our 2012 EPS forecast and 
10.8x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiples of 12.4x earnings and 7.0x EBITDA, the valuation is 
comparable to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United 
Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $44.24 | Buy). We view UNFI as the best comparison for 
CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins relative to most 
distributors (yet at 18%, its gross margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in 
its segment as is CHEF. We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its 
distribution peers (as UNFI does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and 
higher returns on invested capital.  

We maintain our price target of $24.00 as this reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast. Our 
targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of the specialty 
food peer group (twice the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the unattractive 
comparison to the low valuations afforded the traditional food distribution peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

•   A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
    commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
    consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have 
    had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. 
    Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

•   Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, 
    the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and 
    spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness 
    have impacted the performance of the shares. 

•   Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in 
    the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies 
    with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and 
    United Natural Foods. 

•   Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
    Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's 
    total sales originated from the New York market.  

•   Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history 
    and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is 
    highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
    acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of 
    key personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or 
    distribution gains.  

•   Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
    concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands 
    sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

•   Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state 
    and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require 
    various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar 
    regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food 
    products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public 
    awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and 
    organic products 

•   Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
    profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its 
    trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the 
    destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

                                     operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 27.8% to $21.2 million, no change from last years

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and scale undoubtedly offers 
advantages. While the company is still a relatively recent IPO and still establishing a 
reputation with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry and has already 
proven investor concerns of cyclicality unwarranted. We simply believe that if CHEF can 
achieve the top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, it 
can replicate this success in any major market. There is no market in the US with a larger 
base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging 
logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food 
palates anywhere in the country. With an expertise in leveraging its supplier and sourcing 
relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or more readily available 
list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and tangible proof that it can 
dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there is ample reason to be 
comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success into a geographical growth opportunity 
that should ensure ample opportunity for consistent long-term growth. 

Q4 PREVIEW 

Fourth quarter financial results should be published over the coming month, and we 
expect that the results will mirror the recent trends of strong internal growth, gross margin 
consistency and operating leverage that delivers strong pro forma EPS growth. Our 
forecasts assume about 6 points of growth from acquisitions and thus about 12% internal 
growth. Both of these assumptions look conservative given the recent trends and 
acquisition in the Pacific Northwest. We forecast a 26.3% gross margin, right in line with 
recent trends, and see little chance for any material variation given the track record of 
gross margin consistency. We assume that expenses are better leveraged this quarter than 
in Q3, where the company had made some investments behind its Harry Wils acquisition. 
We thus assume higher sequential operating and EBITDA margins than in Q3. Our $0.24 
EPS estimate looks like a base case scenario, and we believe that the consensus forecast of 
$0.25 is very achievable. We are making no changes to our revenue or earnings forecasts 
but see a bias toward positive revisions post Q4 results. 

Thus far in the specialty and healthy food sector, Q4 earnings reports have been positive 
with consistent growth and positive share price movements off the quarterly prints. The 
specialty sector has strong outperformed the traditional food sector. As such, valuations 
have expanded across the group and we anticipate that the business momentum will 
continue with upcoming earnings reports.

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 21.8x our 2012 EPS forecast of $0.95 
and 10.7x forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiples of 13x earnings and 7x EBITDA, the valuation is 
attractive relative to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth 
United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $47.63 | Buy). We view UNFI as the best 
comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
relative to most distributors (yet at 18% its gross margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and 
is the leader in its segment as if CHEF. We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a 
premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI does) given its vastly superior margins, growth 
outlook and higher returns on invested capital.

                                                   Our target equates to 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA 
                                                   multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of the specialty food peer group (twice 
                                                   the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the unattractive comparison to the low 
                                                   valuations afforded the traditional food distribution peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, the 
company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted 
the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in the 
food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies with 
greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural 
Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's total 
sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history and it 
remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is highly 
fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of key 
personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any concern 
about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold through 
CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to profitably 
and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more 
of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-

DELIVERING PORTLAND AND SEATTLE; REITERATE BUY AND 

$18 TARGET  

Investment recommendation 
We expect that CHEF will deliver an EPS growth CAGR of over 20% over the next few years and believe the 
company has considerable geographic growth opportunities to deliver years of growth well above the specialty 
food sector overall. 

Investment highlights 
•   CHEF announces acquisition of Provvista Specialty Foods, providing entry into the Portland and Seattle 
    markets. 

•   Provvista generated $17M of sales last year, servicing over 500 customers with a broad specialty food 
    offering that should be further enhanced under CHEF’s ownership. 

•   No financial terms were disclosed in the announcement, but the acquisition price was likely $5+ million and 
    easily supported by the capital structure. 

•   The deal should certainly add to earnings in 2012, but we will await greater detail before adjusting our 
    forecasts. 

•   We view the acquisition as a validation of the geographical growth strategy that is ideally accomplished 
    through the acquisition of a quality local operator, thus providing the relationships, infrastructure and 
    regional knowledge off which to build. 

•   We reiterate our BUY rating. 

Valuation 
At 15x F2012E EPS and 7.5x EBITDA forecast, we view the valuation as appropriate relative to peers and 
attractive relative to growth prospects. We continue to believe that consistent outperformance relative to the 
distribution sector can expand the valuation. We maintain our target of $18, which is based on a multiple of 9.5x 
F2013E EBITDA.

                                                             8 November 2011 

                                                                                   
Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

•  A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
   excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several 
   years, could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major 
   products sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, 
   flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact 
   CHEF's operations. 

•  Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
   establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as 
   consumer confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding 
   incremental economic weakness have impacted the performance of the 
   shares. 

•  Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
   competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes 
   with larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include 
   Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

•  Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, 
   leaving the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 
   2010, 66% of CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

•  Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
   history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
   industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
   acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
   sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
   expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

•  Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and 
   any concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in 
   the brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always 
   present.  

•  Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
   state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution 
   operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also 
   subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a 
   distributor of specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing 
   governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the 
   sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

                                                                                   

                                                                                  196

•  Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability 
   to profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could 
   result in its trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary 
   closure or the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products, but feel the company 
is best characterized as a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead. While the company is a recent IPO and still establishing a 
reputation with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry. If you can achieve 
the top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, in our 
view, you can replicate it anywhere. Period. There is no market in the US with a larger 
base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging 
logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food 
palates anywhere in the country, if not the world. With an expertise in leveraging its 
supplier and sourcing relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or 
more readily available list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and 
tangible proof that it can dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there 
is ample reason to be comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success in every major 
culinary market in the US. 

Q3 RESULTS 

Third quarter financial results were published last week that met consensus expectations. 
Revenue growth remained robust, with sales rising 20% to $101.7 million. The internal 
growth was 13.3%, down from 17% in Q2, but in line with the year-to-date trend and 
above our forecast of 11.5%. As expected, the Q3 IPO and refinancing led to a GAAP loss in 
the quarter. The loss was $(0.06) vs. our $(0.07) loss forecast, but the key figure was pro 
forma EPS of $0.19, which was in line with consensus while a penny below our $0.20 
forecast. The impact of Hurricane Irene, which impacted over two-thirds of CHEF’s sales 
base during the quarter, was a penny impact to EPS, while higher integration costs 
associated with the Harry Wils acquisition trimmed another penny off the results. The 
quarter was essentially a little stronger than billed, despite broad investor concerns that 
exposure to discretionary restaurant spending and leverage to Wall Street could impair 
results. Coming out of the quarter, we have higher confidence in our growth forecasts, a 
higher expectation of acquisition contribution given the greater retention of Harry Wils 
customers that was achieved by the company boosting spending against the acquisition 
integration, and further confidence in the consistency of gross margins.  

Gross margin continued to expand YOY and run above our long-term based expectation of 
at least 26% margins, coming in at 26.2%. The pro forma operating margin of 6.9% was 
below our forecast of 7.5% given the boosted spending on customer service and 
incremental distribution assets to support the Harry Wils integration. The added 
routes/drivers will normalize during Q4, but we expect the incremental contribution of the 
acquisition to remain. We estimated about $18M of annualized contribution from this most 
recent acquisition, while the actual annualized contribution is running just over $20 
million. We expect operating margins will revert to the trend of YOY expansion in Q4.   

We believe that the Q3 trends are a reflection of a competitive position that should 
continue to deliver market share gains and growth well in excess of the broader food 
service industry. Given higher acquisition integration costs and a hurricane that eliminated 
sales for a short period in its two largest markets, we view the Q3 results very favorably.

Now that we have had an opportunity to more thoroughly review the Q3 financial results, 
we are updating our forecasts for the Q3 actuals and trends exiting the quarter. We are 
making no change to our forward EPS estimates, while modestly increasing our forward 
revenue projections. Our F2011 EPS estimate falls by a penny to $0.76 from $0.77 to 
reflect the Q3 variance driven by Hurricane Irene impact, while we maintain our F2012 
and F2013 EPS estimates of $0.95 and $1.08, respectively. We are increasing our F2011 
revenue forecast to $392 million from $389 million, mostly due to the Q3 variance, 
compounded by a modest increase to our Q4 estimate. For F2012 and F2013, we are 
increasing our revenue forecasts by just over 1%, to $442 million and $480 million from 
$437 million and $474 million, respectively. Our new forecasts continue to reflect internal 
growth in the low teens this year and a more conservative forecast of high single digits in 
F2012 and beyond. We have increased our Harry Wils contribution to just over $20 million 
annualized from $18 million previously and continue to forecast no future acquisitions in 
our model, despite the near certainty that additional consolidation of the highly fragmented 
specialty food distribution will occur. 

On the margins, we have modestly boosted our gross margin forecast for Q4, while 
increasing our operating expense forecast by a like amount. For the full year of 2011, our

margin forecasts were reduced by the Q3 results. Beyond this year, our margin 
expectations have not been materially changed, other than building off a new base in 
F2011.

VALUATION 

Valuation is attractive, in our view. Shares trade at 15x 2012 our EPS forecast of $0.95 
and 9x forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiple of 11-12x earnings and 6-7x EBITDA, the valuation is 
attractive relative to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth 
United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $37.00 | HOLD). We view UNFI as the best 
comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
relative to most distributors (yet at 18% its gross margins are still inferior to CHEF at 26%) 
and is the leader in its segment. The shares trade at a 10%-15% discount to UNFI.  

We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers given 
its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital. Our 
price target of $18.00 equates to 16.5x our 2013 EPS forecast and 9.5x our EBITDA 
forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of 
the specialty food peer group (twice the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the 
unattractive comparison to the low valuations afforded the traditional food distribution 
peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, the 
company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted 
the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in the 
food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies with 
greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural 
Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's total 
sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history and it 
remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is highly 
fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of key 
personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any concern 
about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold through 
CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to profitably 
and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more 
of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products, but feel the company 
is best characterized as a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead. While the company is a recent IPO and still establishing a 
reputation with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry. If you can achieve 
the top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, in our 
view, you can replicate it anywhere. Period. There is no market in the US with a larger 
base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging 
logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food 
palates anywhere in the country, if not the world. With an expertise in leveraging its 
supplier and sourcing relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or 
more readily available list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and 
tangible proof that it can dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there 
is ample reason to be comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success in every major 
culinary market in the US. 

Q3 RESULTS 

Third quarter financial results were published last week that met consensus expectations. 
Revenue growth remained robust, with sales rising 20% to $101.7 million. The internal 
growth was 13.3%, down from 17% in Q2, but in line with the year-to-date trend and 
above our forecast of 11.5%. As expected, the Q3 IPO and refinancing led to a GAAP loss in 
the quarter. The loss was $(0.06) vs. our $(0.07) loss forecast, but the key figure was pro 
forma EPS of $0.19, which was in line with consensus while a penny below our $0.20 
forecast. The impact of Hurricane Irene, which impacted over two-thirds of CHEF’s sales 
base during the quarter, was a penny impact to EPS, while higher integration costs 
associated with the Harry Wils acquisition trimmed another penny off the results. The 
quarter was essentially a little stronger than billed, despite broad investor concerns that 
exposure to discretionary restaurant spending and leverage to Wall Street could impair 
results. Coming out of the quarter, we have higher confidence in our growth forecasts, a 
higher expectation of acquisition contribution given the greater retention of Harry Wils 
customers that was achieved by the company boosting spending against the acquisition 
integration, and further confidence in the consistency of gross margins.  

Gross margin continued to expand YOY and run above our long-term based expectation of 
at least 26% margins, coming in at 26.2%. The pro forma operating margin of 6.9% was 
below our forecast of 7.5% given the boosted spending on customer service and 
incremental distribution assets to support the Harry Wils integration. The added 
routes/drivers will normalize during Q4, but we expect the incremental contribution of the 
acquisition to remain. We estimated about $18M of annualized contribution from this most 
recent acquisition, while the actual annualized contribution is running just over $20 
million. We expect operating margins will revert to the trend of YOY expansion in Q4.   

We believe that the Q3 trends are a reflection of a competitive position that should 
continue to deliver market share gains and growth well in excess of the broader food 
service industry. Given higher acquisition integration costs and a hurricane that eliminated 
sales for a short period in its two largest markets, we view the Q3 results very favorably.

Now that we have had an opportunity to more thoroughly review the Q3 financial results, 
we are updating our forecasts for the Q3 actuals and trends exiting the quarter. We are 
making no change to our forward EPS estimates, while modestly increasing our forward 
revenue projections. Our F2011 EPS estimate falls by a penny to $0.76 from $0.77 to 
reflect the Q3 variance driven by Hurricane Irene impact, while we maintain our F2012 
and F2013 EPS estimates of $0.95 and $1.08, respectively. We are increasing our F2011 
revenue forecast to $392 million from $389 million, mostly due to the Q3 variance, 
compounded by a modest increase to our Q4 estimate. For F2012 and F2013, we are 
increasing our revenue forecasts by just over 1%, to $442 million and $480 million from 
$437 million and $474 million, respectively. Our new forecasts continue to reflect internal 
growth in the low teens this year and a more conservative forecast of high single digits in 
F2012 and beyond. We have increased our Harry Wils contribution to just over $20 million 
annualized from $18 million previously and continue to forecast no future acquisitions in 
our model, despite the near certainty that additional consolidation of the highly fragmented 
specialty food distribution will occur. 

On the margins, we have modestly boosted our gross margin forecast for Q4, while 
increasing our operating expense forecast by a like amount. For the full year of 2011, our

margin forecasts were reduced by the Q3 results. Beyond this year, our margin 
expectations have not been materially changed, other than building off a new base in 
F2011.

VALUATION 

Valuation is attractive, in our view. Shares trade at 15x 2012 our EPS forecast of $0.95 
and 9x forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiple of 11-12x earnings and 6-7x EBITDA, the valuation is 
attractive relative to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth 
United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $37.00 | HOLD). We view UNFI as the best 
comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
relative to most distributors (yet at 18% its gross margins are still inferior to CHEF at 26%) 
and is the leader in its segment. The shares trade at a 10%-15% discount to UNFI.  

We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers given 
its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital. Our 
price target of $18.00 equates to 16.5x our 2013 EPS forecast and 9.5x our EBITDA 
forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of 
the specialty food peer group (twice the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the 
unattractive comparison to the low valuations afforded the traditional food distribution 
peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, the 
company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted 
the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in the 
food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies with 
greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural 
Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's total 
sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history and it 
remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is highly 
fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of key 
personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any concern 
about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold through 
CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to profitably 
and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more 
of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.

                                       In 4Q11, we are looking for EPS of $0.26 and EBITDA of $9.8 million. The consensus 
                                       estimate is $0.25.     Our estimate assumes total sales increase 18.0% to $117.1 million  driven 
                                       by 9% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 50 bp to 26.5%. We forecast 
                                       operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 27.8% to $21.2 million, no change from last years 
                                       margin of 18.1%  leading to a 78-bp improvement in operating margins to 7.9%, or $9.2 
                                       million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.8 million, a 50-bp expansion in margin to 8.4%. We 
                                       assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate and 21.1 million shares outstanding, 
                                       which gets us to EPS of $0.26.  

                                       In 2012, our EPS estimate remains at $0.99.                  Consensus EPS is $0.97. Our EBITDA 
                                       estimate is $38.0 million.       Our estimate assumes total sales increase 12.5% to $442.5 million 
                                       (vs. consensus of $435.0 million), with gross margins improving 30 bp to 26.6%. We forecast 
                                       operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 5.1%                  to $79.6 million, a 90-bp year-over-year 
                                       improvement in margin  leading to a 116-bp improvement in operating margins to 8.0%, or 
                                       $35.5 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $38.0 million, a 120-bp improvement in margin to 
                                       8.6%. We assume interest expense of $1.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate and 21.0 million shares 
                                       outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.99.  

                                       In 3Q11, CHEF reported a LPS of $0.06, or               an EPS of $0.19 when adjusting for several 
                                       one-time items. Adjusted EPS was in line with both our estimate and consensus of $0.19. 
                                       Total sales increased 19.7% to $101.7 million  versus our estimate for 13.5% growth. Gross 
                                       margins improved 21 bp to 26.2%, which was better than our estimate for 75-bp deterioration. 
                                       Operating expenses (excluding D&A) grew 24. 3% to $19.1 million when we exclude a one-
                                       time stock compensation expense and add expected incremental public company costs. We 
                                       were looking for growth in operating expenses (excluding D&A) of 9.1%. Operating margins 
                                       deteriorated 42 bp to 6.9%, or $7.1 million, while EBITDA margins deteriorated 47 bp to 7.4%, 
                                       or $7.5 million. We were looking for operating margin deterioration of 20 bp and EBITDA

                                  margin deterioration of 5 bp. Interest expense came in at $0.5 million after adjusting for the 
                                  post IPO capital structure and one time charges re lated to debt repayments in connection with 
                                  the IPO. Using a normalized 39% tax rate and pro forma 20.8 million shares outstanding gets us 
                                  to EPS of $0.19.  

                                  Additional Takeaways  

                                     The company has seen no change in customer behavior; 

                                     Both case volumes and revenues per case increased in 3Q; 

                                     The companys unique customer growth was in line with trends seen in 1H11; 

                                     The company temporarily increased transportati on infrastructure (fleet capacity increased 
                                      30% in 3Q) and labor infrastructure in order to maintain high service levels with the 
                                      recently acquired Harry Wils customer base       this was a conscious decision made to 
                                      minimize rates of (unwanted) attrition  and maximize retention; 

                                     The decision to increase fleet capacity was larg ely a function of adjusting to new delivery 
                                      windows for the acquired customer base. With  time, the company will optimize routes and 
                                      change delivery windows to minimize incremental expense; 

                                     With the Harry Wils acquisition  one of CH  EFs largest competitors, the split between 
                                      organic growth and acquisitions will shift sli ghtly to higher acquisition growth. This is not 
                                      an indication that organic growth is slowing  it is merely a function of the fact that CHEF 
                                      acquired a competitor that it had previously been gaining share from;  

                                     Mix remained unchanged sequentially, while inflation abated slightly  largely a function 
                                      of lower rates of inflation in dairy; and 

                                     The improved gross margin was a function of   a mix shift within the protein category to 
                                      higher margin items.

Headquartered in Ridgefield, CT, Chefs' Warehouse is the       •  Maintain Buy (1) rating and $20 price target.  We continue to view Chefs’ 
nation's premier distributor of specialty foods. It services       equity  as  undervalued  given  its  strong  fundamental  growth  outlook  and 
more than 7,000 customers; by sales mix, independent               relative valuation discount. Specifically, Chefs’ forward P/E ratio based on 
restaurants   represent   the   largest   customer   segment

Additional Discussion 

EPS in line with consensus but miss us on quasi one-time events; sales beat.  After the close, 
on Thursday, October 27, Chefs’ Warehouse reported Q3’11 pro forma core (before nonrecurring 
items) EPS of $0.19 versus $0.17 in the similar year-ago period; this was in line with consensus 
but $0.03 below our $0.22 estimate.  However, Hurricane Irene trimmed a penny from EPS as did 
unanticipated integration expenses from the recent Harry Wils acquisition in metro New York; 
excluding these quasi one-time events, EPS would have been $0.21. 
 
Top-line growth remained strong.  Sales grew 19.7% yr/yr to $101.7M in Q3, driven by 13.4% 
internal sales gains (10.7% from volume and 2.7% from price/mix) and 6.3% from Harry Wils.  
This beat our estimate of top-line growth of 18% and consensus at 16%. Adding back $1.6M in 
lost business due to Hurricane Irene, sales gains would have registered 21.6% and internal sales 
would have risen 15.3%; this compares well to Q2 internal sales growth 16.7% and gives us 
confidence that sales momentum will remain robust in the intermediate term.  
 
Tweaking earnings model to adjust for Q3 miss; 2012 and 2013 EPS estimates unchanged. 
For 53-week 2011, we forecast growth in sales of 21.3% to $400.5M, in operating profit of 38% 
to $27.8M, and in pro forma EPS of 37% to $0.76 (this is down from our prior $0.79 forecast 
based  on  the  $0.03  miss).  We  have  maintained  our  $0.25  Q4  EPS  projection.    For  2012,  we 
forecast growth in sales at 10% to $440.5M, in operating profit of 23.4% to $34.4M, and in EPS of 
27% to $0.97.  For 2013, we forecast growth in sales of 10.5% to $486.8M, and in EPS of 19% to 
$1.15. We project free cash flow/sh at $0.50 for 2012 and $1.00 for 2013.  
   
Maintain  Buy  (1)  rating  and  $20  price  target.   We  continue  to  view  Chefs’  equity  as 
undervalued  given  its  strong  fundamental  growth  outlook  and  relative  valuation  discount. 
Specifically, Chefs’ forward P/E ratio based on estimated calendar 2012 EPS at 14.4x is valued at 
a 23% discount to the median of its peer group.  Further, its forward PEG (P/E to long-term 
growth rate) at 0.72x is currently at a 38% discount to the group median of 1.17x. 
 

Results in Detail 

Below we present and analyze current and prior-periods on a pro forma basis to reflect the 
impact of Chefs’ recent IPO.  Specific adjustments include the following:  
•   Material   adjustments   to   interest   expense   assuming   post-IPO   financial   leverage   and 
    excluding debt refinancing costs 
•   Modest additional costs to operate a public company 
•   Exclude one-time stock compensation accelerated vesting charge 
•   Tax adjustment (assuming a 39% tax rate) to normalize the 2010 effective tax rate  
 
Q3’11 sales grew 19.7% yr/yr to $101.7M on increased case volume, higher revenue per case, 
and $5.4M of revenue related to Harry Wils; excluding lost sales due to Hurricane Irene, sales 
climbed  21.6%.    Nominal  internal  sales  rose  13.4%  on  real  internal  growth  of  10.7%  and 
inflation/mix of 2.7% while Harry Wils contributed 6.3%.   
 
Gross margin expanded 21 bps yr/yr to 26.19% mainly due to a mix shift to higher margin 
protein  products.    Operating  expenses  increased  21%  yr/yr  while  the  corresponding  ratio 
expanded 25 bps yr/yr to 19.24%, driven primarily by higher labor and fleet expenses related to 
Harry Wils. Operating margin  thus contracted 4 bps yr/yr  to 6.95% while the related profit 
dollars grew 18.9% to $7.1M.  Net interest expense gained 7% to $0.5M while other income was 
nil versus a loss of $0.2M in Q3’10.  The effective tax rate was relatively flat at 39%, resulting in 
net income of $4M, up 15.1% from the similar period last year.  
 
Valuation Methodology & Risk Considerations 

We generally apply forward P/E valuation methods to growth stocks, and we certainly view 
Chefs' that way.  Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF's will ultimately be 
revalued up to the group median of 18.6x calendar 2012 EPS from 14.4x currently.  
 
For the sake of conservatism, we have applied an 8% discount to the group median multiple to 
derive our $20 price target. Mathematically, we take the 18.4x group multiple, multiply that by 
0.92 to yield a target valuation of 17x and apply it to our calendar 2013 EPS forecast of $1.15 to 
yield our $20 price target. 
 

                                                                                         2 of 7 

                                                                                                  238

We believe general risks to achieving our price target include lower-than-forecasted sales and/or 
earnings. Specific risks relevant to Chefs' Warehouse include cyclicality of demand tied to high 
end consumer sentiment, concentration of business in greater New York, fuel price inflation, 
product cost inflation, and acquisition related risks.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating 
is determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to 
the 12-month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best 
estimate of the market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of 
numerous assumptions, including company,  industry,  and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and  relative 
basis, as well as investor sentiment, which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%     
 
NR: Not Rated                       NA:NR:NR:NR:NA: Not Applicable               NM:NA:NA:NM: Not Meaningful           SP:NM:NM:SP: Suspended SP:SP:
 
Stocks rated Buy (1) are required to have a published 12-month price target, while it is not required on stocks rated 
Hold (2) and Underweight (3).

GROWTH KEEPS COOKING; REITERATE BUY AND $18 TARGET  

Investment recommendation 
We expect that CHEF will deliver an EPS growth CAGR of over 20% over the next few years and believe the company has 
considerable geographic growth opportunities to deliver years of growth well above the specialty food sector overall.    

Investment highlights 
•   CHEF delivers a strong Q3 with EPS of $0.19 on an adjusted basis vs. $0.17 last year, meeting consensus despite a $0.01 
    impact from Hurricane Irene and higher spending integrating the Harry Wils acquisition. The business is clearly trending 
    ahead of Street expectations. 

•   Revenue was up 20% to $102M vs. consensus of $98M as internal growth remained strong near 14% and acquisition 
    contribution was a little ahead of our forecast. We expect the sales momentum to continue with incremental earnings 
    leverage vs. Q3. 

•   Concerns over CHEF’s exposure to discretionary spending and its concentration in New York with a volatile Wall Street 
    outlook are obviously overblown, in our view, and we believe that investors will begin to recognize that the company can 
    grow through today’s environment. We expect the valuation to re-expand as the consistency of revenue growth is further 
    illustrated despite the economic backdrop. 

•   Guidance for both revenue and EPS was maintained, with the high end of the revenue guidance the right place to be. We 
    have not had an opportunity to yet reflect the Q3 revenue upside in our forecasts. 

•   We reiterate our BUY rating and $18 price target. Our investment thesis is incrementally validated as CHEF’s robust 
    growth continues and its integration of Harry Wils, while a little more costly in its first quarter, is tracking 10-20% above 
    our revenue contribution forecast. The growth of specialty foods, market share gains and acquisition opportunities are 
    the foundation of our expectation that CHEF can be a consistent double-digit grower, and each was evident in the Q3 
    results. 

Valuation 
At 14.8x F2012 P/E and 8.9x F2012 EBITDA, we view valuation as attractive and believe shares deserve a premium valuation 
relative to the food distribution sector (average of 11.5x F2012 P/E and 6.5x F2012 EBITDA) given the superior growth and 
margins. We maintain our target of $18, which is based on a multiple of 9.5x F2013 EBITDA.

                                     Investment risks 
                                     Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
                                     following: 

                                     A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
                                     commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
                                     consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
                                     their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
                                     fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

                                     Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, the 
                                     company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
                                     fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted 
                                     the performance of the shares. 

                                     Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in the 
                                     food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies with 
                                     greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural 
                                     Foods. 

                                     Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
                                     Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's total 
                                     sales originated from the New York market.  

                                     Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history and it 
                                     remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is highly 
                                     fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
                                     acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of key 
                                     personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
                                     gains.  

                                     Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any concern 
                                     about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold through 
                                     CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

                                     Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
                                     local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
                                     licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
                                     requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
                                     is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
                                     safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

                                     Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to profitably 
                                     and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
                                     unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more

rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.

Company Description: 
The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
United States. The company's core customers are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments, as well as country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The 
company distributes more than 11,500 food products, incl uding an extensive selection of distinctive and hard-
to-find specialty items, to over 7,000 customer locations in the United States. 
 
Discussion 
 
On October 27, The Chefs Warehouse posted Q3 2011 modified pro forma EPS of $0.19, which was above our 
estimate of $0.18 and versus $0.17 last year.  Relative to our target, the earnings upside mainly reflected higher 
than expected sales growth in the period.  On a GAAP    basis, the company reported a Q3 loss per share of 
$0.06, which included financing, tran saction, and other costs related to th e companys initial public offering 
completed in the quarter.  Management also noted that Hurricane Irene negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 in 
the quarter. 
 
Revenue increased 19.7% to $101.7 million versus our $98. 5 million target and $84.9 million last year.  Of the 
19.7% in revenue growth, 6.4% was from the Harry Wi     ls acquisition, and 2.7%  was from product mix and 
inflation, leaving real (organic) growth of 10.6%.     We are particularly impressed by these topline 
results, as we had been targeting organic growth of 7.5%.  Gross Profit margin was 26.2% versus our 
26.0% estimate and 26.0% last year, while operating income margin came in at 6.9% versus our 6.8% estimate 
and 6.9% last year.  
 
In terms of recent trends, management noted on the earnings conference call that the companys key metrics, 
such as new customers and product placements, continue  to reach all-time highs.   Management also indicated 
that their high-end restaurant customers appear to be holding up well in the current environment.  
 
We were encouraged to hear that the Harry   Wils acquisition appears to be performing well.   
Management decided to increase fleet  and staff support in Q3 to ensure  customer service was maintained to 
standard during the integration process.  The company gained over 500 new customers in New York over a 
short period of time with the acquisition and thought that it was a good investment to increase fleet capacity by 
30% to ensure customer satisfaction. Management has   since begun to pare back on the fleet additions and 
hopes to reduce the recent fleet additions by about half to a more normalized level. 
 
Key Growth Strategies.  The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements:  continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities, further improve operating margins and target selective acquisitions.  We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings. Management believes they are the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of thei r customers and management  is focused on maintaining 
this position while working to become the primary specialt y distributor for a larger portion of their customers.  
We also think the company has the opportunity to       enhance their distribution network by adding new 
customers in existing markets.  We   think the companys combination of   traditional and specialty product 
offerings coupled with their ability to cultivate strong customer relationships should enable The Chefs 
Warehouse to continue to expand their customer base within existing markets. The organic growth 
opportunities, if successful, should enhance the oper  ating margin by leveraging   economies of scale in 
purchasing, warehousing, distribution and when combined with fixed cost leverage should result in improved 
profitability.  We also think opportunities exist within  the highly fragmented foodservice distribution industry 
for The Chefs Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitio ns which have the potential to expand the breadth of 
the companys distribution network, and further enhance operating efficiencies as well as product offerings 
and other capabilities.   
 
Company guidance.  Management reiterated FY2011 guidance  of modified pro forma EPS of $0.76-0.79, 
based in part on revenue of $384-$392 million.     Management also noted that their guidance range now 
includes a $0.01 negative impact from Hurricane Iren e and a $0.01 negative impact from the Harry Wils 
transition, neither of which it included previously.    On a reported basis, 2011 EPS is expected to be $0.41-
0.42.  In addition, the effective tax rate for the year is  expected to be 39%, and diluted shares outstanding are 
expected to be 20.8 million.   
 
Raising EPS Estimates.   We are raising our 2011 EPS estimate to $0.77 from $0.76 and our 2012 EPS 
estimate to $0.98 from $0.97, both of which reflect th e Q3 2011 earnings upside.  We note that with the Q3 
revenue upside, our 2011 revenue target is above managements guidance range.

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                                               EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

We continue to think that The Chefs Warehouse is well-positioned to generate EPS growth of approximately 
17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS growth rate is based in part on 7-10% real 
or organic sales growth, relatively consistent gross margins, and some leverage on the operating expense and 
interest expense lines.  We also think that selectiv           e acquisitions could further enhance the companys long-
term growth rate. 
 
Rating & Valuation.   We are maintaining our Outperform rating on CHEF shares, which reflects current 
valuation as well as our favorable view of the comp                 anys competitive positionin g within the foodservice 
distribution industry.  We believe that CHEF is poised  for growth given the companys presence in key culinary 
markets combined with their customer focus on serving the needs of chefs at independent restaurants and 
their product focus of sourcing specia lty food offerings.  We also think   that the companys growth potential 
could be further enhanced through sele ctive acquisition opportunities.  CH EF shares are trading at 14.2x our 
2012 EPS estimate versus a multiple of 16.0x for the peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of 17%. 
On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.6x. 
Over the next twelve months, we believe that CHEF shares may warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a 
multiple of 19-20x our FY2012 EPS es  timate. In our view, key risk factors that could affect share valuation 
include the inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, sales and commodity volatility, challenges related to 
sourcing products, and risks related to their geographic concentration.

                                                    The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact of 
                                                     acquisitions and inflation.  

                                                    Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant

                                                    Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its

                                                     Washington, DC facility, and how the company is progressing against its timeline to

                                          $16.8 million, a 70 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 20 bp deterioration 
                                          in operating margins to 7.2%, or $6.9 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $7.5 million, a 5 bp

                                 grow 15.9% to $72.0 million, a 39 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 
                                 49 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.0%, or $27.4 million. This gets us to EBITDA of

INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS  

•   Initiating coverage of The Chefs’ Warehouse with a BUY rating and an $18.00 price 
    target, reflecting a premium to the broader food distribution group but a discount to 
    the specialty food peer group.  

•   Establishing F2011 revenue and pro forma EPS estimates of $389 million and $0.77, 
    respectively. For F2012 we forecast revenue and EPS of $437 million and $0.95 per 
    share, respectively. For F2013 we forecast revenue and EPS of $474 million and $1.08 
    per share. 

•   We view The Chefs’ Warehouse as an excellent play on the growth of specialty foods 
    through food service locations that should deliver favorable internal earnings growth 
    and a considerable opportunity to expand geographically through acquisition given an 
    inherently fragmented sector due to the focus on specialty foods and ingredients. 

•   CHEF is as a well managed, high quality growth company that has considerable 
    competitive advantages. The opportunity at The Chefs’ Warehouse, in our opinion, is 
    the focus on product catalogue expansion in the specialty food distribution category, 
    executing strategic acquisitions within a highly fragmented industry to obtain greater 
    scale in both existing and new markets, and leveraging a technology and management 
    infrastructure that already has the capacity to support considerable growth. 

•   We believe the food distribution industry will continue to benefit from strong 
    underlying trends, including an increased focus on the quality of foods we ingest, along 
    with healthier eating trends that feed into Chef’s product catalogue, such as natural 
    and/or organic inputs.  

•   An increasingly bleak economic outlook will likely weigh on all economically sensitive 
    companies. However, we believe CHEF’s customers are focused on the appropriate 
    demographic and as such should be somewhat more resilient. We would view any 
    pressure on white tablecloth dining establishments as an opportunity for CHEF to 
    expand its franchise through market share gains and acquisitions. We believe 
    franchise value won’t be impacted by any risk of a consumer spending dip in the long 
    run.  

•   The specialty foods categories offer superior growth to conventional foods, with 
    growth rates approaching the high single digits when natural and hormone-free 
    ingredients are included in the mix. The drivers are numerous, including the aging of 
    the population and an expanding American palate fed by everything from rising 
    international travel over the years and even the exploding popularity of television 
    shows focused on gourmet cooking that have created blockbusters such as Top Chef, 
    Hell’s Kitchen, and Iron Chef, just to name a few. More than any time in history, 
    Americans are attracted to specialty and gourmet foods and top chefs have become 
    pop icons. It isn’t just the Food Network anymore and it isn’t just steak and potatoes 
    anymore either. 

•   The valuation is highly attractive, in our view, as shares currently trade at a 36% P/E 
    discount relative to specialty foods group peers and a 19% discount to CHEF’s closest 
    comparison, United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $38.01 | HOLD).

•   Shares trade at 16.9x our F2011 EPS estimate and 9.6x this year’s projected EBITDA. 
    The valuation is a discount to the specialty food peer group while a premium to the 
    food distribution segment. If we consider CHEF’s best comparable, UNFI, the shares 
    are trading at 19% and 25% discounts on C2011 and C2012 EPS estimates, 
    respectively. However, we forecast 39% pro forma EPS growth this year and 24% 
    growth next year. We expect share price appreciation to exceed earnings growth given 
    that CHEF’s attractive relative valuation following the recent market turmoil has been 
    impacted by both declining peer valuations and concerns of economic sensitivity that 
    are likely over done. Further, the company’s heavy exposure to the New York market 
    (over 60% of sales) likely drives a modest discounting of the valuation that should 
    decline as geographical growth continues.  

INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products, but feel the company 
is best characterized as a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead. While the company is a recent IPO, we believe it is clearly 
already proven. If you can achieve the top market share of specialty foods sold into the 
New York culinary market, in our view you can replicate it anywhere. Period. There is no 
market in the US with a larger base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary 
offerings, no more challenging logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more 
demanding consumers or food palates anywhere in the country, if not the world. With an 
expertise in leveraging its supplier and sourcing relationships throughout the world to 
ensure a broader, deeper or more readily available list of gourmet foods and ingredients 
than its competition, and tangible proof that it can dominate the most challenging market 
in the US, we believe there is ample reason to be comfortable that CHEF can replicate its 
success in every major culinary market in the US.

We are initiating coverage of CHEF with a BUY rating and an $18.00 price target. Our 
thesis on picking good long-term growth stocks is very simple and consists of the following 
steps to identify four key attributes:  

1.  identify a specialty consumer trend that generates consistent annual growth above the 
    broader sector; 

2.  bet on the players that have a key core competency that will drive market share gains; 

3.  invest in a good management team with systems that support growth and consistency; 

4.  ensure that there is an economic model that will deliver good returns to shareholders. 

CHEF has eachCHEF has eCHEF has eCHEF has e ach of these attributes coveredachach  of these attributes covered  of these attributes covered of these attributes covered    

1.  We believe that specialty foods will continue to outpace the growth of the broader food 
    sector. In simplest terms, food growth equates to population growth plus inflation. 
    CHEF focused on the food service sector and generally toward the higher end of the 
    sector, and as such annual growth will vary with economic activity. But, given a 
    superior growth rate for the sector, we see reduced risk that CHEF delivers growth. If 
    specialty foods can continue to grow in the mid to high single digits this year (gourmet 
    at the lower end and natural/organic at the higher end), CHEF should deliver superior 

                                                                                            

                                                                                            277

                                                                   7 September 2011 

                                                                                            
    growth. We see no retrenchment in the trend toward a more discerning American 
    consumer that would impact the superior category growth. 

2.  CHEF has a key advantage over its fragment specialty food distribution peers in that it 
    has a broader and deeper product offering with key producer relationships in the US 
    and abroad. This is not the only advantage, but is the key, in our opinion, to CHEF’s 
    market share gains and the major platform to leverage with expansion into new 
    markets. Specialty and gourmet distribution to food service is fragmented with small 
    independent players contributing most of the sales. There simply isn’t a comparison to 
    what CHEF brings to bear. As long as CHEF delivers the same level of service (it does, 
    if not better) and delivers on time and often (it does), all the company must do is 
    establish relationships to gain share, and it is accomplishing this by making 
    acquisitions into most new markets to begin key relationships and adding quality 
    salespeople or in-market acquisitions to expand its relationships within existing 
    markets. The company also enjoys superior systems, and not just because of its 
    greater scale. We have been impressed since day one with the quality of the 
    technology systems at CHEF in all respects as we compared them to similar sized 
    distribution operations which we have encountered in the past. Its physical system 
    strengths are apparent in its asset utilization. 

3.  While every investment report has some language about the quality of management, 
    almost always positive, we have some historical prospective to offer. We have 
    encountered many businesses that met three of our four key attributes, and nearly 
    every time that quality leadership wasn’t one of the four, the idea didn’t pan out as we 
    expected. No shock here, but it deserves attention. Historically, when we encounter a 
    family-founded business with the founder still running the company, we rarely find 
    quality outside additions to the management team. It usually takes a challenge for the 
    hiring of key outsiders to occur. This is not the case at CHEF. There is a passionate 
    leader who has built this company from the ground up and augmented his 
    management team with experience and quality. During the company’s IPO road show, 
    this was the second most frequently referenced comment we heard following the belief 
    that the company had considerable acquisition growth opportunity. The best way to 
    evaluate management, in our opinion, is usually to evaluate the tools the team has put 
    into place and the diligence behind how decisions are made. Given the quality of 
    systems in place and diligence used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, we 
    believe that CHEF offers investors a quality organization that is already scaled to a 
    level where CHEF can deliver both growth and operating leverage simultaneously. 

4.  Finally, a great growth sector, core competencies and good systems are only as good 
    as the economic model. While CHEF is a distributor, it isn’t a typical distributor model. 
    The company generates 26% gross margins with stable historical trends, turns its 
    inventory rapidly enough to enjoy over 100% vendor financing, turns its fixed assets 
    incredibly quickly and should yield over 30% ROIC and over 40% ROE. This simply 
    isn’t the traditional distributor model and thus shouldn’t trade like a traditional 
    distributor model. The premium ROE deserves a premium valuation. 

                                                                                            

                                                                                           278

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 

The specialty/gourmet end of the foodservice market is a highly fragmented industry where 
the competition is generally more narrowly focused on specific product categories or 
geographical exposure. We aren’t going to argue that white tablecloth restaurant sales are 
on the verge of exploding, but we will argue that the utilization of specialty ingredients is 
rising throughout the food service industry. This growth trend, along with a competitive 
environment that is highly favorable for CHEF, is where the growth lies. We believe CHEF 
will expand market share in existing markets, seek acquisitions for the purposes of 
expansion of distribution into new markets as well as increasing its presence in existing 
markets and leverage its infrastructure to deliver earnings growth that exceeds revenue 
growth. Each of these growth drivers is already proven and driving results. We forecast 
39% pro forma EPS growth this year and 24% next year. Without acquisitions, we would 
still be forecasting 20% EPS growth next year. Beyond 2012, we are using a base case 
revenue growth rate in the high single digits with mid-teens EPS growth prior to any 
benefit from acquisitions to enter new markets or expand existing markets.  

We believe that there are several growth opportunities at CHEF that should deliver 
revenue growth well ahead of the mid-single-digit-plus growth of specialty foods. Growth 
opportunities include: 

•   Specialty focus ensures superior growth versus broader food service industry that 
    might grow 1% ex-inflation 

•   Growth within existing markets through expanding the customer base as CHEF can 
    leverage a broader and deeper product catalogue to gain share from competitors 

•   Growth within existing accounts through expansion of the product offering and higher 
    specialty food penetration rates, thus capturing higher share of each account’s 
    purchasing 

•   Considerable geographic growth exists as CHEF still generates 60% of sales in the New 
    York market. The company has considerable opportunity to expand its existing 
    markets outside of the New York area and enter new markets 

•   Acquisitions can effectively add geographies, customers or product expertise 

Focus on specialty foods  
In our view, the exposure to premium specialty, gourmet or natural/organic inputs 
positions CHEF to enjoy a higher inherent growth rate. Over the years, we have 
encountered long-term growth estimates anywhere from 5-9% for the specialty food 
industry, with the variances usually driven by the components in each forecast. According 
to The State of the Specialty Food Industry report published by the National Association for 
the Specialty Food Trade, specialty food sales rose 7.4% in 2010 after a 4.2% increase in 
2009 at retail. While this data is predominantly focused on retail sales rather than 
foodservice sales, the growth trend is driven by the same consumer preferences. In fact, 
the foodservice industry is generally the leader in new specialty food trends. Further, 
according to the data, 76% of specialty food manufacturers (CHEF’s suppliers) reported 
growth in 2010 with 36% reporting growth above 20%. The data is similar for specialty 
food importers, where 72% of importers reported growth in 2010 and 28% reported 
growth in excess of 20%. We believe it is clear that the specialty food industry is a growth 

                                                                                           

                                                                                          279

                                                                Daily Letter |   6 
                                                                   7 September 2011 

                                                                                             
industry. This data is very applicable to the trends at CHEF. For example, in this research, 
the largest reported product category of specialty foods was cheese, which is consistent 
with CHEF’s product exposure. 

While specialty foods carry higher price points and thus should be more economically 
sensitive, the history in specialty food categories is that there is more ample growth to 
accommodate shocks to consumer spending. What is key, however, is that growth of this 
product category isn’t driven by rising employment or incomes, but rather the underlying 
macro trends that drive consumers to a broader palate and more concern for the quality of 
the foods they eat. This trend is the key to CHEF’s exposure to specialty foods, not whether 
consumer confidence plunges one month or the next. In the higher end of the food service 
industry there will of course be economic sensitivity, but as history has indicated, the 
consumer has always come back and after living through the violent economic impacts of 
late 2008 and early 2009, the industry should be better equipped than ever to handle sales 
volatility.   

Client growth within existing markets 
Investor growth expectations following the IPO road show were most keenly focused on the 
geographical growth opportunity and the ability to roll up a fragmented industry, or at 
least leverage acquisitions to enter new markets. While there is substantial geographic and 
acquisition growth opportunity, we believe that the opportunity to expand share within 
existing markets is just as significant, if not more so, to the long-term growth story. Simply 
put, we believe CHEF has a better offering, better capitalization and better systems than its 
regional competition. We repeatedly hear of efforts to reduce the number of trucks 
showing up at the back door each day and thus consolidation of suppliers should naturally 
play into CHEF’s strength. However, the real benefit is simply that CHEF has more of what 
chefs want, delivers it on time and the chefs can have greater confidence in the consistency 
of a larger, broader, publically-traded supplier. Leveraging this broader and deeper 
product offering is an appropriate sales force of approximately 125 professionals, the 
majority of whom have formal culinary training or the like. A better salesperson with a 
better product offering usually wins. The sales force, given its experience, has been able to 
create a strong network of relationships with its customers, many of which often begin at 
some of the nation’s leading culinary schools. Equipped with advanced culinary and 
industry knowledge, CHEF’s sales professionals seek to establish a rapport with its 
customers so that they can more fully understand and anticipate their needs and offer cost-
effective food product solutions. Such an intimate knowledge of what goes on in the kitchen 
by a sizable sales force differentiates The Chefs’ Warehouse from its broadline competitors 
as well as the smaller niche specialty distributors that do not have the scale to provide an 
array of goods as vast as CHEF’s. While this is the last analogy a chef or restaurant patron 
wants to hear us use, it is true that CHEF has a better mouse trap (sorry, we couldn’t 
resist). 

Growth within existing accounts 
First, we must recognize that CHEF’s customers do not use a single food service supplier. 
CHEF doesn’t carry every food item that a restaurant uses and certainly not all of the 
restaurant supplies that a restaurant utilizes. As a result, there is an inherent opportunity 
to expand the market share of each account in which CHEF sells. This naturally occurs for 
any new distributor to an account as the account ramps up, but what we are more focused 
on is expansion of the product offering and the increased penetration of each menu for the 

                                                                                             

                                                                                            280

                                                                Daily Letter |   7 
                                                                   7 September 2011 

                                                                                             
specialty food inputs that CHEF markets. Given the data that specialty foods are growing 
mid-plus single digits while the food service industry isn’t, there is a clear trend toward 
specialty foods accounting for a higher percentage of a specialty foodservice operator’s cost 
of sales. Here lies the opportunity for CHEF to grow its average drop size and allow mix to 
contribute to revenue growth over and above customer growth. We expect this trend will 
continue to contribute to the revenue growth rate. 

Geographic growth opportunities 
The opportunity for geographic growth is obvious at this point. Given that we have 
highlighted CHEF’s superior product offering, a fragmented industry nationwide and now 
a balance sheet that provides ammunition for acquisitions into new markets, we only need 
note that CHEF still generates 60% of its sales in New York and has a physical presence in 
only six major markets, of which Miami is just 12 months old. Given our belief that success 
in New York implies that success can be had in any market, there is substantial 
opportunity for growth.

Expansion of the geographical footprint should be able to provide long-term above average 
growth given the relatively narrow focus today. We also believe it is important to note that 
CHEF’s expansion strategy to date seems appropriately focused on the markets with the 
largest opportunities, illustrating a targeted strategy of both acquisitions and geographical 
expansion. Some of the noted potential market and acquisition opportunities are 
highlighted in the following figure.

Acquisitions and leveraging distribution 
We’ll start with the very important statement once again that the specialty foodservice 
distribution sector is highly fragmented. We believe CHEF will seek acquisitions for the 
purposes of expansion of distribution into new markets as well as increasing its presence 
in existing markets. The recently completed acquisition of Harry Wils in the New York 
market is an excellent example of a tuck-in acquisition, while the acquisition of Culinarie 
Specialty Foods in Miami last year is a perfect example of new market entry through 
acquisition. Consolidation has been a proven business model in the food distribution 
industry in all channels as there are clear economies of scale, but it is incrementally 
attractive in the fragmented specialty category, in our opinion, given that supplier 
relationships are incrementally important and the breadth of the product offering is a key 
differentiator given how fragmented the supplier base is as well. In our view, CHEF has a 
disciplined M&A strategy that is exemplified by its success with its acquisition history to 
date, the pace at which it has grown through acquisition and the diligence the company 
utilizes in its evaluation of acquisitions. Future acquisition targets will likely be geared 
toward expanding the customer base in both new and existing markets, but also the 
product catalogue by utilizing the acquired firms’ existing relationships to obtain access to 
additional specialty goods or importing relationships, which we view favorably given 
inherent growth of the segment.  

RISKS 

There are several aspects of CHEF’s business model and competitive position that mitigate 
risk. Most importantly, the company has no measurable customer or supplier 
concentration risks to mention given its diversified base of customers and suppliers. 
Further, the company has minimal debt leverage post IPO and is in a competitive position 

                                                                                             

                                                                                            282

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

The Chefs’ Warehouse, founded by Christopher and John Pappas in 1985 as Dairyland 
USA and still recognized under this banner, is a premier distributor of specialty foods in 
the United States. With its corporate headquarters in Ridgefield, CT, the company focuses 
its sales efforts on developing relationships with the chefs who own or operate 
independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, 
culinary schools and specialty food stores in six of the nation’s leading culinary markets, 
including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Miami. 
By leveraging an experienced and sophisticated sales force of approximately 125 sales 
professionals, CHEF sells to more than 7,000 chefs while also providing the route-to-
market for many of its suppliers. Sitting in between a fragmented customer base and a 
fragmented supplier base, CHEF enjoys a level of market power that is a key advantage.  

The company operates out of just seven distribution centers and provides service six days a 
week in many of its service areas. Its specialty food and ingredient offering, defined as 
gourmet foods and ingredients that are of the highest grade, quality or style as measured 
by their uniqueness, exotic origin or particular processing method, is sourced from over 
1,000 suppliers throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Its product 
portfolio includes over 11,500 SKUs comprised primarily of imported and domestic 
specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and 
vinegars, hormone-free protein, truffles, caviar and chocolate. CHEF also offers an 
extensive line of broadline food products; including cooking oils, butter, eggs, milk and 
flour. No supplier accounts for more than 5% of sales, a broad exposure that is consistent 
with its diversified customer base as well. CHEF has effectively eliminated its dependence 
upon any single supplier and also mitigates risks by utilizing sophisticated forecasting and 
inventory management systems to minimize the carrying time of commodity-oriented 
products.

In addition to being the largest specialty foodservice distributor in the key New York 
market, the company is a leader in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles as 
well and is building out Miami and Las Vegas at a rapid clip. While not the focus, The 
Chefs’ Warehouse also makes its product catalogue available online for purchasing. Its 
website, Chefswarehouse.com, can allow investors to broaden their own palette with 
exclusive foods or attempt to emulate that special dish at their favorite upscale restaurant. 

Beginning in 2005, Chefs’ Warehouse embarked upon several acquisitions (about one per 
year) to facilitate distribution growth within not only new markets, but existing ones as 
well. The first such purchase was Van Rex Gourmet Foods, which had operations in the 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas markets. The company completed three 
additional accretive tuck-in acquisitions (approximately $4 million to $5 million each) in 
the San Francisco and Maryland markets between 2007 and 2009. New market expansion 
continued with the purchase of Monique & Me, Inc. in June 2010 for $3.7 million to obtain 
entrance into the Miami area. Finally in June 2011, Harry Wils & Co. was purchased for $9 
million to provide further scaling within the New York market. 

Product overview 
In our view, CHEF’s key competitive advantage is its comprehensive product portfolio of 
over 11,500 specialty and broadline goods, with over 7,000 in stock every day, and its 
ability to leverage relationships with suppliers to gain access to exclusive products not 
easily accessible to competitive suppliers. Captive products clearly add to the stickiness of 
customers and can provide a price advantage to customers while delivering good margin to 
the company. Additionally, CHEF still has opportunity for product portfolio additions based 
on both existing and anticipated trends in the culinary industry, which constantly evolve. 
New product introductions in the specialty food industry are a significant driver of growth. 
Given that the company is focused on leading chefs and enjoys a specialty ingredient 
supplier base that often leads trends, CHEF is an excellent position to be at the forefront of 
new product and ingredient trends.  

The company seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering a more extensive 
depth and breadth of its specialty food offering. CHEF carries a wide range of high-quality 
specialty food products including artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and 
vinegars, hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar and chocolate across each of its markets, 
but also offers a number of items in each of its respective markets that are tailored to meet 
the unique preferences of the individual chefs in that market. The specialty food industry 
often has distinct regional characteristics.

Within CHEF’s product offerings, it carries a broad assortment of gourmet brands, but also 
seeks to maximize product contribution through the offering of proprietary brands, which 
CHEF offers in a number of categories, including bulk olive oil, Italian grating cheeses and 
butter. Through its offering of both high-quality specialty foods and ingredients, along with 
more traditional broadline staple food products, CHEF provides its customers with 
foodservice distribution solutions that are more efficient, broader and should thus be more 
cost effective than its competition.

week in many areas, CHEF utilizes a fleet of delivery trucks to fill an average of 11,000

orders weekly, usually within 12-24 hours of order placement. CHEF’s average distribution 
service level, or the percentage of in-stock items ordered by customers that were delivered 
by the requested date, was in excess of 99% as of fiscal year end 2010. To achieve these 
high service levels and proactively seek to improve upon operations, the company has 
invested significantly in sophisticated warehousing, inventory control and distribution 
systems. Examples of such investments are as follows: 

•   A fully-integrated MIS in CHEF’s primary New York City distribution facility which 
    provides real-time inventory visibility and detailed metrics related to inventory turns. 
    Plans are under way to integrate this system into the remaining distribution facilities 
    by the end of 2011.  

•   Pick-to-voice technology in each of its distribution facilities that enable its warehouse 
    employees to fill orders with greater speed and accuracy.  

•   Advanced routing and logistics planning software which maximizes the number of 
    daily deliveries that each truck can make while also enabling CHEF to make deliveries 
    within each customer’s preferred two- to three-hour time window. 

•   GPS and vehicle monitoring technology to regularly evaluate the condition of delivery 
    trucks and monitor the performance of drivers by tracking their progress relative to 
    their delivery schedule.

With its broad distribution solution and focus on menu-driven independent restaurants, 
fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools and specialty 
food stores, no meaningful customer concentration exists as the company’s top 10 
customers accounted for less than 10% of total net revenue for 2010. The company 
distributes one or more products on a weekly basis to more than 60% of its addressable 
market in the New York metropolitan area (CHEF defines its addressable market as 
independent restaurants with an average entrée price of greater than $15.00) and between 
20%-30% of its addressable market in the other markets that CHEF serves. While The 
Chefs’ Warehouse has successfully managed to penetrate more than half of its addressable 
New York market, it is still expanding its customer base in New York and increasing the 
average order size and profitability of its average New York customer.

CHEF extends credit to virtually all of its customers, but does not have the high level of 
write-offs that might naturally be assumed. CHEF’s Credit and Collections Department 
consists of 11 full-time employees and regularly evaluates credit terms for each customer 
based upon several factors. The company’s historical average write-offs have been below 
one half of one percent over the past three years. 

Management 
As we indicated, we believe that The Chefs’ Warehouse has assembled a strong 
management team augmenting passionate founders with experienced executives in key 
roles such as functional areas, including finance, sales and marketing, information 
technology and human resources. The management team is effective, successful and 
capable of driving the company forward through continued growth and market expansion, 
in our opinion. The senior management has already demonstrated the ability to grow the 
business, responded effectively to the financial crisis and economic weakness a couple of 
years ago with prudent actions and put in place the infrastructure to support future 
profitable growth and operating leverage. Following the recent initial public offering, the 
management team continues to own half of the outstanding shares.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 

CHEF is a well capitalized, highly profitable business that generates free cash flow while 
enjoying strong internal growth and considerable acquisition opportunities. We view 
CHEF’s economic model as a key facet of the investment thesis and given the 
fragmentation of both its customer base and supplier base, we see minimal risk to the 
attractive economic characteristics of the business model. Following the IPO and Q2 
results, the company has just $44 million of debt, or just over 1x our forward EBITDA 
forecast, and ample capacity on its new credit facility. The company turns its assets 
rapidly, and by our estimates should generate over 30% ROIC and over 40% ROE on a go 
forward basis after adjusting for the recent recapitalization. These returns, along with a 
large and fragmented addressable market, should support an above average growth rate.

In establishing our estimates, we have extrapolated recent trends, while moderating the 
internal growth over the coming quarters as we monitor a tenuous consumer spending 
environment. For example, in Q3, we forecast relatively flat sales sequentially and flat EPS 
sequentially despite a measurable acquisition contribution from the Harry Wils acquisition 
completed at the end of Q2. The conservative forecast should allow for any potential sales 
disruption from the recent hurricane that impacted the New York market and compensate 
for the economic environment. Our estimates do not assume rapid growth of the 
foodservice industry that CHEF addresses, but reflect market share gains, some modest

                                                                                                         7 September 2011 

                                                                                                                                    
                                    mix/inflation benefit, acquisition contribution and more rapid growth in new markets. In 
                                    all, we forecast 18% revenue growth in F2011 to $389 million, which compares to 
                                    guidance of $384 to $392 million. In our F2011 growth forecast, we estimate about 4% 
                                    growth due to acquisitions and the remainder coming from organic growth driven both by 
                                    higher case volumes and a modest 3% mix benefit for the full year. For F2012, we forecast 
                                    12% revenue growth to $437 million with 2% coming from acquisitions and the 10% 
                                    organic growth generated mostly by higher case volume. In each year, we forecast 
                                    operating leverage delivering superior EPS growth, but do not assume gross margin 
                                    improvement from recent trends. In fact, our gross margin forecast is below the trend in 
                                    the first half of F2011 as we are extrapolating the average over the last two years.  

                                    For F2011, we forecast $0.77 of pro forma EPS, up 39% YOY from $0.55 in F2010. We 
                                    estimate an adjusted operating margin of 7.1%, up about 100 bp YOY. For F2012, we 
                                    estimate pro forma EPS of $0.95, reflecting incremental operating margin improvement of 
                                    80 basis points to 7.9%. Again, in 2012, the operating margin improvement should be 
                                    driven by leverage of operating expenses rather than gross margin improvement, 
                                    according to our forecasts.  In F2013, we are utilizing a base case assumption of 9% 
                                    revenue growth and 14% EPS growth, or $474 million of revenue and $1.08 of EPS.

                                    Recent results 
                                    Q2 financial reports were published recently with GAAP EPS of $0.17 on $99.3 million of 
                                    revenue, which represented 19% and 25% YOY increases in the respective figures. Gross 
                                    profit increased 19.7% to $26.2 million for the second quarter of 2011 from $21.9 million 
                                    for the prior year period as the gross margin increased to 27 basis points to 26.5%. GAAP 
                                    operating income increased approximately 37.5% to $7.7 million for the second quarter of 
                                    2011 compared to $5.6 million for the second quarter of 2010, while EBITDA increased 
                                    31.3% to $8.1 million for the second quarter of 2011 from $6.2 million for the second 
                                    quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, EPS rose 36% to $0.20 from $0.15 a year ago. The 
                                    quarter delivered a strong gross margin, operating leverage, favorable free cash flow and 
                                    strong growth in every metric. We believe that the Q2 trends are a good indicator of what 
                                    should be expected in the back-half of 2011, despite rising economic and consumer 
                                    concerns facing the food service industry. 

                                    Accompanying CHEF’s Q2 results, the company also introduced initial financial guidance 
                                    for full year 2011: 

                                                                                                                                    

                                                                                                                                   290

                                               •    Revenue between $384 million and $392 million. 

                                               •    GAAP net income per diluted share between $0.41 and $0.44. 

                                               •    Modified pro forma net income per diluted share between $0.76 and $0.79. 

                                               VALUATION 

                                               Valuation is attractive, in our view. Shares trade at 16.9x our 2011 EPS forecast of $0.77, 
                                               which is below the peer group multiple of 26.4x for the specialty foods group, while a 
                                               significant premium to the food distribution peer group multiple of 12.2x. We argue that 
                                               CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers given its vastly superior margins, 
                                               growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital. If we use a simple average of these 
                                               two peer groups, CHEF should trade at 19.3x this year earnings, implying that the shares 
                                               are 12% undervalued. Shares also trade at just 9.6x this year’s projected EBITDA and 8.3x 
                                               next year’s EBITDA forecast.  

                                               Compared to its most closely related comparison, UNFI, shares are trading at a roughly 
                                               19% discount on a 2011 EPS basis and 24% on F2012 forecasts. We view UNFI as the best 
                                               comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
                                               relative to most distributors (yet still inferior at 18% to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in 
                                               its segment.  

                                               Our price target of $18.00 equates to 16.5x our 2013 EPS forecast and 9.5x our EBITDA 
                                               forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of 
                                               the specialty food peer group, reduced by the unattractive comparison to the low 
                                               valuations afforded the traditional food distribution peer group.

Financial overview                                            17 •   CHEF enjoys significant competitive advantages given a broader and deeper 
Valuation                                                              21 product offering and has proven its ability to dominate in existing markets, yet 
 
                                            considerable geographical growth opportunity lies ahead. 

                                       •   The business model yields higher margins and ROIC vs. other food distributors and 
                                            should deliver operating leverage while generating double-digit revenue growth. 

                                       •   A highly fragmented special food distribution industry offers ample consolidation 
                                            opportunities, and we believe acquisitions should deliver incremental growth and 
                                            facilitate new market entries. 

                                       Valuation 
                                       We view valuation as attractive and believe shares deserve a premium valuation 
                                       relative to the food distribution sector. 

                                       Risks 
                                       Given a focus on the premium side of food service, CHEF will be economically sensitive. 
                                       Further, nearly two-thirds of sales were generated in the greater New York market last 
                                       year, generating a regional sales concentration risk.

                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

                                   We believe CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products, but feel the company 
                                   is best characterized as a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
                                   growth opportunity lying ahead. While the company is a recent IPO, we believe it is clearly 
                                   already proven. If you can achieve the top market share of specialty foods sold into the 
                                   New York culinary market, in our view you can replicate it anywhere. Period. There is no 
                                   market in the US with a larger base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary 
                                   offerings, no more challenging logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more 
                                   demanding consumers or food palates anywhere in the country, if not the world. With an 
                                   expertise in leveraging its supplier and sourcing relationships throughout the world to 
                                   ensure a broader, deeper or more readily available list of gourmet foods and ingredients 
                                   than its competition, and tangible proof that it can dominate the most challenging market 
                                   in the US, we believe there is ample reason to be comfortable that CHEF can replicate its 
                                   success in every major culinary market in the US. 

                                   Four key attributes 
                                   We are initiating coverage of CHEF with a BUY rating and an $18.00 price target. Our 
                                   thesis on picking good long-term growth stocks is very simple and consists of the following 
                                   steps to identify four key attributes:  

                                   1.  identify a specialty consumer trend that generates consistent annual growth above the 
                                       broader sector; 

                                   2.  bet on the players that have a key core competency that will drive market share gains; 

                                   3.  invest in a good management team with systems that support growth and consistency; 

                                   4.  ensure that there is an economic model that will deliver good returns to shareholders. 

                                   CHEF has each of these attributes covered 
                                   1.  We believe that specialty foods will continue to outpace the growth of the broader food 
                                       sector. In simplest terms, food growth equates to population growth plus inflation. 
                                       CHEF focused on the food service sector and generally toward the higher end of the 
                                       sector, and as such annual growth will vary with economic activity. But, given a 
                                       superior growth rate for the sector, we see reduced risk that CHEF delivers growth. If 
                                       specialty foods can continue to grow in the mid to high single digits this year (gourmet 
                                       at the lower end and natural/organic at the higher end), CHEF should deliver superior 
                                       growth. We see no retrenchment in the trend toward a more discerning American 
                                       consumer that would impact the superior category growth. 

                                   2.  CHEF has a key advantage over its fragment specialty food distribution peers in that it 
                                       has a broader and deeper product offering with key producer relationships in the US 
                                       and abroad. This is not the only advantage, but is the key, in our opinion, to CHEF’s 
                                       market share gains and the major platform to leverage with expansion into new 
                                       markets. Specialty and gourmet distribution to food service is fragmented with small 
                                       independent players contributing most of the sales. There simply isn’t a comparison to 
                                       what CHEF brings to bear. As long as CHEF delivers the same level of service (it does, 
                                       if not better) and delivers on time and often (it does), all the company must do is

                                      establish relationships to gain share, and it is accomplishing this by making 
                                      acquisitions into most new markets to begin key relationships and adding quality 
                                      salespeople or in-market acquisitions to expand its relationships within existing 
                                      markets. The company also enjoys superior systems, and not just because of its 
                                      greater scale. We have been impressed since day one with the quality of the 
                                      technology systems at CHEF in all respects as we compared them to similar sized 
                                      distribution operations which we have encountered in the past. Its physical system 
                                      strengths are apparent in its asset utilization. 

                                  3.  While every investment report has some language about the quality of management, 
                                      almost always positive, we have some historical prospective to offer. We have 
                                      encountered many businesses that met three of our four key attributes, and nearly 
                                      every time that quality leadership wasn’t one of the four, the idea didn’t pan out as we 
                                      expected. No shock here, but it deserves attention. Historically, when we encounter a 
                                      family-founded business with the founder still running the company, we rarely find 
                                      quality outside additions to the management team. It usually takes a challenge for the 
                                      hiring of key outsiders to occur. This is not the case at CHEF. There is a passionate 
                                      leader who has built this company from the ground up and augmented his 
                                      management team with experience and quality. During the company’s IPO road show, 
                                      this was the second most frequently referenced comment we heard following the belief 
                                      that the company had considerable acquisition growth opportunity. The best way to 
                                      evaluate management, in our opinion, is usually to evaluate the tools the team has put 
                                      into place and the diligence behind how decisions are made. Given the quality of 
                                      systems in place and diligence used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, we 
                                      believe that CHEF offers investors a quality organization that is already scaled to a 
                                      level where CHEF can deliver both growth and operating leverage simultaneously. 

                                  4.  Finally, a great growth sector, core competencies and good systems are only as good 
                                      as the economic model. While CHEF is a distributor, it isn’t a typical distributor model. 
                                      The company generates 26% gross margins with stable historical trends, turns its 
                                      inventory rapidly enough to enjoy over 100% vendor financing, turns its fixed assets 
                                      incredibly quickly and should yield over 30% ROIC and over 40% ROE. This simply 
                                      isn’t the traditional distributor model and thus shouldn’t trade like a traditional 
                                      distributor model. The premium ROE deserves a premium valuation.

                                   INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS 

                                   •   Initiating coverage of The Chefs’ Warehouse with a BUY rating and an $18.00 price 
                                       target, reflecting a premium to the broader food distribution group but a discount to 
                                       the specialty food peer group.  

                                   •   Establishing F2011 revenue and pro forma EPS estimates of $389 million and $0.77, 
                                       respectively. For F2012 we forecast revenue and EPS of $437 million and $0.95 per 
                                       share, respectively. For F2013 we forecast revenue and EPS of $474 million and $1.08 
                                       per share. 

                                   •   We view The Chefs’ Warehouse as an excellent play on the growth of specialty foods 
                                       through food service locations that should deliver favorable internal earnings growth 
                                       and a considerable opportunity to expand geographically through acquisition given an 
                                       inherently fragmented sector due to the focus on specialty foods and ingredients. 

                                   •   CHEF is as a well managed, high quality growth company that has considerable 
                                       competitive advantages. The opportunity at The Chefs’ Warehouse, in our opinion, is 
                                       the focus on product catalogue expansion in the specialty food distribution category, 
                                       executing strategic acquisitions within a highly fragmented industry to obtain greater 
                                       scale in both existing and new markets, and leveraging a technology and management 
                                       infrastructure that already has the capacity to support considerable growth. 

                                   •   We believe the food distribution industry will continue to benefit from strong 
                                       underlying trends, including an increased focus on the quality of foods we ingest, along 
                                       with healthier eating trends that feed into Chef’s product catalogue, such as natural 
                                       and/or organic inputs.  

                                   •   An increasingly bleak economic outlook will likely weigh on all economically sensitive 
                                       companies. However, we believe CHEF’s customers are focused on the appropriate 
                                       demographic and as such should be somewhat more resilient. We would view any 
                                       pressure on white tablecloth dining establishments as an opportunity for CHEF to 
                                       expand its franchise through market share gains and acquisitions. We believe 
                                       franchise value won’t be impacted by any risk of a consumer spending dip in the long 
                                       run.  

                                   •   The specialty foods categories offer superior growth to conventional foods, with 
                                       growth rates approaching the high single digits when natural and hormone-free 
                                       ingredients are included in the mix. The drivers are numerous, including the aging of 
                                       the population and an expanding American palate fed by everything from rising 
                                       international travel over the years and even the exploding popularity of television 
                                       shows focused on gourmet cooking that have created blockbusters such as Top Chef, 
                                       Hell’s Kitchen, and Iron Chef, just to name a few. More than any time in history, 
                                       Americans are attracted to specialty and gourmet foods and top chefs have become 
                                       pop icons. It isn’t just the Food Network anymore and it isn’t just steak and potatoes 
                                       anymore either. 

                                   •   The valuation is highly attractive, in our view, as shares currently trade at a 34% P/E 
                                       discount relative to specialty foods group peers and a 19% discount to CHEF’s closest 
                                       comparison, United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $39.55 | HOLD).

                                 •   Shares trade at 17.9x our F2011 EPS estimate and 11.2x this year’s projected 
                                      EBITDA. The valuation is a discount to the specialty food peer group while a premium 
                                      to the food distribution segment. If we consider CHEF’s best comparable, UNFI, the 
                                      shares are trading at 19% and 24% discounts on C2011 and C2012 EPS estimates, 
                                      respectively. However, we forecast 39% pro forma EPS growth this year and 24% 
                                      growth next year. We expect share price appreciation to exceed earnings growth given 
                                      that CHEF’s attractive relative valuation following the recent market turmoil has been 
                                      impacted by both declining peer valuations and concerns of economic sensitivity that 
                                      are likely over done. Further, the company’s heavy exposure to the New York market 
                                      (over 60% of sales) likely drives a modest discounting of the valuation that should 
                                      decline as geographical growth continues.  

                                 INVESTMENT THESIS 

                                 The specialty/gourmet end of the foodservice market is a highly fragmented industry where 
                                 the competition is generally more narrowly focused on specific product categories or 
                                 geographical exposure. We aren’t going to argue that white tablecloth restaurant sales are 
                                 on the verge of exploding, but we will argue that the utilization of specialty ingredients is 
                                 rising throughout the food service industry. This growth trend, along with a competitive 
                                 environment that is highly favorable for CHEF, is where the growth lies. We believe CHEF 
                                 will expand market share in existing markets, seek acquisitions for the purposes of 
                                 expansion of distribution into new markets as well as increasing its presence in existing 
                                 markets and leverage its infrastructure to deliver earnings growth that exceeds revenue 
                                 growth. Each of these growth drivers is already proven and driving results. We forecast 
                                 39% pro forma EPS growth this year and 24% next year. Without acquisitions, we would 
                                 still be forecasting 20% EPS growth next year. Beyond 2012, we are using a base case 
                                 revenue growth rate in the high single digits with mid-teens EPS growth prior to any 
                                 benefit from acquisitions to enter new markets or expand existing markets.  

                                 We believe that there are several growth opportunities at CHEF that should deliver 
                                 revenue growth well ahead of the mid-single-digit-plus growth of specialty foods. Growth 
                                 opportunities include: 

                                 •   Specialty focus ensures superior growth versus broader food service industry that 
                                      might grow 1% ex-inflation 

                                 •   Growth within existing markets through expanding the customer base as CHEF can 
                                      leverage a broader and deeper product catalogue to gain share from competitors 

                                 •   Growth within existing accounts through expansion of the product offering and higher 
                                      specialty food penetration rates, thus capturing higher share of each account’s 
                                      purchasing 

                                 •   Considerable geographic growth exists as CHEF still generates 60% of sales in the New 
                                      York market. The company has considerable opportunity to expand its existing 
                                      markets outside of the New York area and enter new markets 

                                 •   Acquisitions can effectively add geographies, customers or product expertise

                                   FOCUS ON SPECIALTY FOODS  

                                   In our view, the exposure to premium specialty, gourmet or natural/organic inputs 
                                   positions CHEF to enjoy a higher inherent growth rate than that which is being observed 
                                   within the overall $191 billion (of which $100 billion relates to CHEF’s addressable 
                                   restaurant market as of 2009) foodservice distribution industry. Over the years, we have 
                                   encountered long-term growth estimates anywhere from 5-9% for the specialty food 
                                   industry, with the variances usually driven by the components in each forecast. According 
                                   to The State of the Specialty Food Industry report published by the National Association for 
                                   the Specialty Food Trade, specialty food sales rose 7.4% in 2010 after a 4.2% increase in 
                                   2009 at retail. While this data is predominantly focused on retail sales rather than 
                                   foodservice sales, the growth trend is driven by the same consumer preferences. In fact, 
                                   the foodservice industry is generally the leader in new specialty food trends. Further, 
                                   according to the data, 76% of specialty food manufacturers (CHEF’s suppliers) reported 
                                   growth in 2010 with 36% reporting growth above 20%. The data is similar for specialty 
                                   food importers, where 72% of importers reported growth in 2010 and 28% reported 
                                   growth in excess of 20%. We believe it is clear that the specialty food industry is a growth 
                                   industry. This data is very applicable to the trends at CHEF. For example, in this research, 
                                   the largest reported product category of specialty foods was cheese, which is consistent 
                                   with CHEF’s largest single product category in CHEF’s offering. 

                                   While specialty foods carry higher price points and thus should be more economically 
                                   sensitive, the history in specialty food categories is that there is more ample growth to 
                                   accommodate shocks to consumer spending. What is key, however, is that growth of this 
                                   product category isn’t driven by rising employment or incomes, but rather the underlying 
                                   macro trends that drive consumers to a broader palate and more concern for the quality of 
                                   the foods they eat. This trend is the key to CHEF’s exposure to specialty foods, not whether 
                                   consumer confidence plunges one month or the next. In the higher end of the food service 
                                   industry there will of course be economic sensitivity, but as history has indicated, the 
                                   consumer has always come back and after living through the violent economic impacts of 
                                   late 2008 and early 2009, the industry should be better equipped than ever to handle sales 
                                   volatility.   

                                   CLIENT GROWTH WITHIN EXISTING MARKETS 

                                   Investor growth expectations following the IPO road show were most keenly focused on the 
                                   geographical growth opportunity and the ability to roll up a fragmented industry, or at 
                                   least leverage acquisitions to enter new markets. While there is substantial geographic and 
                                   acquisition growth opportunity, we believe that the opportunity to expand share within 
                                   existing markets is just as significant, if not more so, to the long-term growth story. Simply 
                                   put, we believe CHEF has a better offering, better capitalization and better systems than its 
                                   regional competition. We repeatedly hear of efforts to reduce the number of trucks 
                                   showing up at the back door each day and thus consolidation of suppliers should naturally 
                                   play into CHEF’s strength. However, the real benefit is simply that CHEF has more of what 
                                   chefs want, delivers it on time and the chefs can have greater confidence in the consistency 
                                   of a larger, broader, publically-traded supplier. Leveraging this broader and deeper 
                                   product offering is an appropriate sales force of approximately 125 professionals, the 
                                   majority of whom have formal culinary training or the like. A better salesperson with a 
                                   better product offering usually wins. The sales force, given its experience, has been able to

                                 create a strong network of relationships with its customers, many of which often begin at 
                                 some of the nation’s leading culinary schools where enrollment has been on the rise in 
                                 recent years. As just two examples, the Culinary Art Institute of Virginia has seen 
                                 applications increase from approximately 50 to over 550 since opening its doors six years 
                                 ago, and the Culinary Art Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, has experienced 
                                 almost a 50% increase in the same time while having to add an additional satellite campus 
                                 to accommodate more students.. Equipped with advanced culinary and industry 
                                 knowledge, CHEF’s sales professionals seek to establish a rapport with its customers so 
                                 that they can more fully understand and anticipate their needs and offer cost-effective food 
                                 product solutions. Such an intimate knowledge of what goes on in the kitchen by a sizable 
                                 sales force differentiates The Chefs’ Warehouse from its broadline competitors as well as 
                                 the smaller niche specialty distributors that do not have the scale to provide an array of 
                                 goods as vast as CHEF’s. While this is the last analogy a chef or restaurant patron wants to 
                                 hear us use, it is true that CHEF has a better mouse trap (sorry, we couldn’t resist). 

                                 GROWTH WITHIN EXISTING ACCOUNTS 

                                 First, we must recognize that CHEF’s customers do not use a single food service supplier. 
                                 CHEF doesn’t carry every food item that a restaurant uses and certainly not all of the 
                                 restaurant supplies that a restaurant utilizes. As a result, there is an inherent opportunity 
                                 to expand the market share of each account in which CHEF sells. This naturally occurs for 
                                 any new distributor to an account as the account ramps up, but what we are more focused 
                                 on is expansion of the product offering and the increased penetration of each menu for the 
                                 specialty food inputs that CHEF markets. Given the data that specialty foods are growing 
                                 mid-plus single digits while the food service industry isn’t, there is a clear trend toward 
                                 specialty foods accounting for a higher percentage of a specialty foodservice operator’s cost 
                                 of sales. Here lies the opportunity for CHEF to grow its average drop size and allow mix to 
                                 contribute to revenue growth over and above customer growth. We expect this trend will 
                                 continue to contribute to the revenue growth rate. 

                                 GEOGRAPHIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 

                                 The opportunity for geographic growth is obvious at this point. Given that we have 
                                 highlighted CHEF’s superior product offering, a fragmented industry nationwide and now 
                                 a balance sheet that provides ammunition for acquisitions into new markets, we only need 
                                 note that CHEF still generates 60% of its sales in New York and has a physical presence in 
                                 only six major markets, of which Miami is just 12 months old. Given our belief that success 
                                 in New York implies that success can be had in any market, there is substantial 
                                 opportunity for growth.

                                    Expansion of the geographical footprint should be able to provide long-term above average 
                                    growth given the relatively narrow focus today. We also believe it is important to note that 
                                    CHEF’s expansion strategy to date seems appropriately focused on the markets with the 
                                    largest opportunities, illustrating a targeted strategy of both acquisitions and geographical 
                                    expansion. Some of the noted potential market and acquisition opportunities are

                                  ACQUISITIONS AND LEVERAGING DISTRIBUTION 

                                  We’ll start with the very important statement once again that the specialty foodservice 
                                  distribution sector is highly fragmented. We believe CHEF will seek acquisitions for the 
                                  purposes of expansion of distribution into new markets as well as increasing its presence 
                                  in existing markets. The recently completed acquisition of Harry Wils in the New York 
                                  market is an excellent example of a tuck-in acquisition, while the acquisition of Culinarie 
                                  Specialty Foods in Miami last year is a perfect example of new market entry through 
                                  acquisition. Consolidation has been a proven business model in the food distribution 
                                  industry in all channels as there are clear economies of scale, but it is incrementally 
                                  attractive in the fragmented specialty category, in our opinion, given that supplier 
                                  relationships are incrementally important and the breadth of the product offering is a key 
                                  differentiator given how fragmented the supplier base is as well. In our view, CHEF has a 
                                  disciplined M&A strategy that is exemplified by its success with its acquisition history to 
                                  date, the pace at which it has grown through acquisition and the diligence the company 
                                  utilizes in its evaluation of acquisitions. Future acquisition targets will likely be geared 
                                  toward expanding the customer base in both new and existing markets, but also the 
                                  product catalogue by utilizing the acquired firms’ existing relationships to obtain access to 
                                  additional specialty goods or importing relationships, which we view favorably given 
                                  inherent growth of the segment.  

                                  RISKS 

                                  There are several aspects of CHEF’s business model and competitive position that mitigate 
                                  risk. Most importantly, the company has no measurable customer or supplier 
                                  concentration risks to mention given its diversified base of customers and suppliers. 
                                  Further, the company has minimal debt leverage post IPO and is in a competitive position 
                                  that should reduce the risk of pricing pressure that could impact margins. Nonetheless, 
                                  there are several risks to consider. 

                                  Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
                                  following: 

                                  A rise in commodity prices:    While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
                                  commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
                                  consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
                                  their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
                                  fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF’s operations. 

                                  Economic sensitivity:    Given CHEF’s focus on higher end food service esta   blishments, the 
                                  company is exposed to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
                                  fluctuate. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted the 
                                  performance of the shares. 

                                  Competitive activity:   Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in 
                                  the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies 
                                  with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United 
                                  Natural Foods.

                                   Market concentration:     CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
                                   company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF’s total 
                                   sales originated from the New York market.  

                                   Acquisition and integration risk:    CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history, 
                                   and acquisitions remain a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is 
                                   highly fragmented, and the company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
                                   acquisitions could strain management resources and result in sales disruptions or loss of 
                                   key personnel, and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
                                   gains.  

                                   Product recalls and/or food safety concerns:        CHEF products are ingested, and any 
                                   concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold 
                                   through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

                                   Industry regulation:   CHEF’s line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
                                   local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
                                   licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
                                   requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
                                   is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
                                   safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products. 

                                   Weather:   Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF’s ability to profitably 
                                   and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
                                   unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more 
                                   of its distribution centers. 

                                   In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
                                   found in The Chefs’ Warehouse’s most recent regulatory filings. 

                                   COMPANY OVERVIEW 

                                   The Chefs’ Warehouse, founded by Christopher and John Pappas in 1985 as Dairyland 
                                   USA and still recognized under this banner, is a premier distributor of specialty foods in 
                                   the United States. With its corporate headquarters in Ridgefield, CT, the company focuses 
                                   its sales efforts on developing relationships with the chefs who own or operate 
                                   independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, 
                                   culinary schools and specialty food stores in six of the nation’s leading culinary markets, 
                                   including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Miami. 
                                   By leveraging an experienced and sophisticated sales force of approximately 125 sales 
                                   professionals, CHEF sells to more than 7,000 chefs while also providing the route-to-
                                   market for many of its suppliers. Sitting in between a fragmented customer base and a 
                                   fragmented supplier base, CHEF enjoys a level of market power that is a key advantage.  

                                   The company operates out of just seven distribution centers and provides service six days a 
                                   week in many of its service areas. Its specialty food and ingredient offering, defined as 
                                   gourmet foods and ingredients that are of the highest grade, quality or style as measured 
                                   by their uniqueness, exotic origin or particular processing method, is sourced from over 
                                   1,000 suppliers throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Its product 
                                   portfolio includes over 11,500 SKUs comprised primarily of imported and domestic

                                  specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and 
                                  vinegars, hormone-free protein, truffles, caviar and chocolate. CHEF also offers an 
                                  extensive line of broadline food products; including cooking oils, butter, eggs, milk and 
                                  flour. No supplier accounts for more than 5% of sales, a broad exposure that is consistent 
                                  with its diversified customer base as well. CHEF has effectively eliminated its dependence 
                                  upon any single supplier and also mitigates risks by utilizing sophisticated forecasting and 
                                  inventory management systems to minimize the carrying time of commodity-oriented 
                                  products.

                                  In addition to being the largest specialty foodservice distributor in the key New York 
                                  market, the company is a leader in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles as 
                                  well and is building out Miami and Las Vegas at a rapid clip. While not the focus, The 
                                  Chefs’ Warehouse also makes its product catalogue available online for purchasing. Its 
                                  website, Chefswarehouse.com, can allow investors to broaden their own palette with 
                                  exclusive foods or attempt to emulate that special dish at their favorite upscale restaurant. 

                                  Beginning in 2005, Chefs’ Warehouse embarked upon several acquisitions (about one per 
                                  year) to facilitate distribution growth within not only new markets, but existing ones as 
                                  well. The first such purchase was Van Rex Gourmet Foods, which had operations in the 
                                  Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas markets. The company completed three 
                                  additional accretive tuck-in acquisitions (approximately $2 million to $5 million each) in 
                                  the San Francisco and Maryland markets between 2007 and 2009. New market expansion 
                                  continued with the purchase of Monique & Me, Inc. in June 2010 for $3.7 million to obtain 
                                  entrance into the Miami area. Finally in June 2011, Harry Wils & Co. was purchased for $9 
                                  million to provide further scaling within the New York market.

                                    PRODUCT OVERVIEW 

                                    In our view, CHEF’s key competitive advantage is its comprehensive product portfolio of 
                                    over 11,500 specialty and broadline goods, with over 7,000 in stock every day, and its 
                                    ability to leverage relationships with suppliers to gain access to exclusive products not 
                                    easily accessible to competitive suppliers. Captive products clearly add to the stickiness of 
                                    customers and can provide a price advantage to customers while delivering good margin to 
                                    the company. Additionally, CHEF still has opportunity for product portfolio additions based 
                                    on both existing and anticipated trends in the culinary industry, which constantly evolve. 
                                    New product introductions in the specialty food industry are a significant driver of growth. 
                                    Given that the company is focused on leading chefs and enjoys a specialty ingredient 
                                    supplier base that often leads trends, CHEF is an excellent position to be at the forefront of 
                                    new product and ingredient trends.

                                    The company seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering a more extensive 
                                    depth and breadth of its specialty food offering. CHEF carries a wide range of high-quality 
                                    specialty food products including artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and 
                                    vinegars, hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar and chocolate across each of its markets,

                                   seeks to maximize product contribution through the offering of proprietary brands, which 
                                   CHEF offers in a number of categories, including bulk olive oil, Italian grating cheeses and 
                                   butter. Through its offering of both high-quality specialty foods and ingredients, along with 
                                   more traditional broadline staple food products, CHEF provides its customers with 
                                   foodservice distribution solutions that are more efficient, broader and should thus be more 
                                   cost effective than its competition.

                                    service level, or the percentage of in-stock items ordered by customers that were delivered 
                                    by the requested date, was in excess of 99% as of fiscal year end 2010. To achieve these 
                                    high service levels and proactively seek to improve upon operations, the company has 
                                    invested significantly in sophisticated warehousing, inventory control and distribution 
                                    systems.  

                                    Examples of such investments are as follows: 

                                    •   A fully-integrated MIS in CHEF’s primary New York City distribution facility which 
                                        provides real-time inventory visibility and detailed metrics related to inventory turns. 
                                        Plans are under way to integrate this system into the remaining distribution facilities 
                                        by the end of 2011.  

                                    •   Pick-to-voice technology in each of its distribution facilities that enable its warehouse 
                                        employees to fill orders with greater speed and accuracy.  

                                    •   Advanced routing and logistics planning software which maximizes the number of 
                                        daily deliveries that each truck can make while also enabling CHEF to make deliveries 
                                        within each customer’s preferred two- to three-hour time window. 

                                    •   GPS and vehicle monitoring technology to regularly evaluate the condition of delivery 
                                        trucks and monitor the performance of drivers by tracking their progress relative to 
                                        their delivery schedule.

                                    customers accounted for less than 10% of total net revenue for 2010. The company 
                                    distributes one or more products on a weekly basis to more than 60% of its addressable 
                                    market in the New York metropolitan area (CHEF defines its addressable market as 
                                    independent restaurants with an average entrée price of greater than $15.00) and between 
                                    20%-30% of its addressable market in the other markets that CHEF serves. While The 
                                    Chefs’ Warehouse has successfully managed to penetrate more than half of its addressable 
                                    New York market, it is still expanding its customer base in New York and increasing the 
                                    average order size and profitability of its average New York customer.

                                  CHEF extends credit to virtually all of its customers, but does not have the high level of 
                                  write-offs that might naturally be assumed. CHEF’s Credit and Collections Department 
                                  consists of 11 full-time employees and regularly evaluates credit terms for each customer 
                                  based upon several factors. The company’s historical average write-offs have been below 
                                  one half of one percent over the past three years. 

                                  MANAGEMENT 

                                  As we indicated, we believe that The Chefs’ Warehouse has assembled a strong 
                                  management team augmenting passionate founders with experienced executives in key 
                                  roles such as functional areas, including finance, sales and marketing, information 
                                  technology and human resources. The management team is effective, successful and 
                                  capable of driving the company forward through continued growth and market expansion, 
                                  in our opinion. The senior management has already demonstrated the ability to grow the 
                                  business, responded effectively to the financial crisis and economic weakness a couple of 
                                  years ago with prudent actions and put in place the infrastructure to support future 
                                  profitable growth and operating leverage. Following the recent initial public offering, the 
                                  management team continues to own half of the outstanding shares.  

                                  Christopher Pappas, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 
                                  Mr. Pappas has served as the CEO since founding the company as Dairyland USA in 1985 
                                  and has been Chairman since March 1, 2011. Mr. Pappas currently oversees all business 
                                  activities, with a focus on product procurement, sales, marketing and strategy 
                                  development. Mr. Pappas's qualifications to serve on the board of directors include his 
                                  extensive knowledge of the company and the specialty food products distribution business 
                                  and his years of leadership at the company.

                                  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 

                                  CHEF is a well capitalized, highly profitable business that generates free cash flow while 
                                  enjoying strong internal growth and considerable acquisition opportunities. We view 
                                  CHEF’s economic model as a key facet of the investment thesis and given the 
                                  fragmentation of both its customer base and supplier base, we see minimal risk to the 
                                  attractive economic characteristics of the business model. Following the IPO and Q2 
                                  results, the company has just $44 million of debt, or just over 1x our forward EBITDA 
                                  forecast, and ample capacity on its new credit facility. The company turns its assets 
                                  rapidly, and by our estimates should generate over 30% ROIC and over 40% ROE on a go 
                                  forward basis after adjusting for the recent recapitalization. These returns, along with a 
                                  large and fragmented addressable market, should support an above average growth rate.

                                    In establishing our estimates, we have extrapolated recent trends, while moderating the 
                                    internal growth over the coming quarters as we monitor a tenuous consumer spending 
                                    environment. For example, in Q3, we forecast relatively flat sales sequentially and flat EPS 
                                    sequentially despite a measurable acquisition contribution from the Harry Wils acquisition 
                                    completed at the end of Q2. The conservative forecast should allow for any potential sales 
                                    disruption from the recent hurricane that impacted the New York market and compensate 
                                    for the economic environment. Our estimates do not assume rapid growth of the 
                                    foodservice industry that CHEF addresses, but reflect market share gains, some modest 
                                    mix/inflation benefit, acquisition contribution and more rapid growth in new markets. In 
                                    all, we forecast 18% revenue growth in F2011 to $389 million, which compares to 
                                    guidance of $384 to $392 million. In our F2011 growth forecast, we estimate about 4% 
                                    growth due to acquisitions and the remainder coming from organic growth driven both by 
                                    higher case volumes and a modest 3% mix benefit for the full year. For F2012, we forecast 
                                    12% revenue growth to $437 million with 2% coming from acquisitions and the 10% 
                                    organic growth generated mostly by higher case volume. In each year, we forecast 
                                    operating leverage delivering superior EPS growth, but do not assume gross margin 
                                    improvement from recent trends. In fact, our gross margin forecast is below the trend in 
                                    the first half of F2011 as we are extrapolating the average over the last two years.  

                                    For F2011, we forecast $0.77 of pro forma EPS, up 39% YOY from $0.55 in F2010. We 
                                    estimate an adjusted operating margin of 7.1%, up about 100 bp YOY. For F2012, we 
                                    estimate pro forma EPS of $0.95, reflecting incremental operating margin improvement of 
                                    80 basis points to 7.9%. Again, in 2012, the operating margin improvement should be 
                                    driven by leverage of operating expenses rather than gross margin improvement, 
                                    according to our forecasts.  In F2013, we are utilizing a base case assumption of 9% 
                                    revenue growth and 14% EPS growth, or $474 million of revenue and $1.08 of EPS.

                                    Q2 financial reports were published recently with GAAP EPS of $0.17 on $99.3 million of 
                                    revenue, which represented 19% and 25% YOY increases in the respective figures. Gross 
                                    profit increased 19.7% to $26.2 million for the second quarter of 2011 from $21.9 million 
                                    for the prior year period as the gross margin increased to 27 basis points to 26.5%. GAAP 
                                    operating income increased approximately 37.5% to $7.7 million for the second quarter of 
                                    2011 compared to $5.6 million for the second quarter of 2010, while EBITDA increased

                                               quarter of 2010. On an adjusted basis, EPS rose 36% to $0.20 from $0.15 a year ago. The 
                                               quarter delivered a strong gross margin, operating leverage, favorable free cash flow and 
                                               strong growth in every metric. We believe that the Q2 trends are a good indicator of what 
                                               should be expected in the back-half of 2011, despite rising economic and consumer 
                                               concerns facing the food service industry.

                                   GUIDANCE 

                                   Accompanying CHEF’s Q2 results, the company also introduced initial financial guidance 
                                   for full year 2011: 

                                   •   Revenue between $384 million and $392 million. 

                                   •   GAAP net income per diluted share between $0.41 and $0.44. 

                                   •   Modified pro forma net income per diluted share between $0.76 and $0.79. 

                                   VALUATION 

                                   Valuation is attractive, in our view. Shares trade at 17.9x our 2011 EPS forecast of $0.77, 
                                   which is below the peer group multiple of 27x for the specialty foods group, while a 
                                   significant premium to the food distribution peer group multiple of 12.6x. We argue that 
                                   CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers given its vastly superior margins, 
                                   growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital. If we use a simple average of these 
                                   two peer groups, CHEF should trade at 19.8x this year earnings, implying that the shares 
                                   are 10% undervalued. Shares also trade at just 11.2x this year’s projected EBITDA and 
                                   8.6x next year’s EBITDA forecast.  

                                   Compared to its most closely related comparison, UNFI, shares are trading at a roughly 
                                   19% discount on a 2011 EPS basis and 24% on F2012 forecasts. We view UNFI as the best 
                                   comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
                                   relative to most distributors (yet still inferior at 18% to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in 
                                   its segment.  

                                   Our price target of $18.00 equates to 16.5x our 2013 EPS forecast and 9.5x our EBITDA 
                                   forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of 
                                   the specialty food peer group, reduced by the unattractive comparison to the low 
                                   valuations afforded the traditional food distribution peer group.

Company Description: 

The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
U.S. The company's core customer           s are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments as well as country clubs, hotels, cate        rers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The

Key Investment Points 
 
Initiating coverage with an Outperform rating.    We are initiating coverage of The Chefs Warehouse 
with an Outperform rating, which reflects current valu  ation as well as our favorable view of the companys 
competitive positioning within the foodservice distributi  on industry.  We believe that CHEF is poised for 
growth given the companys presence in key culinary markets combined with their customer focus on serving 
the needs of chefs at independent restaurants and their pr oduct focus of sourcing specialty food offerings.  We 
also think that the companys growth potential coul           d be further enhanced thro  ugh selective acquisition 
opportunities. 
 
Share valuation.  CHEF shares are trading at 14.0x our 2012 EPS estimate versus a multiple of 15.8x for the 
peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of  17%. On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading 
at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.5x. Over the next twelve months, we believe that CHEF 
shares may warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a multiple of 20-21x our 2012 EPS estimate. In our 
view, key risk factors that could        affect share valuation include the inability to successfully integrate 
acquisitions, sales and commodity volati lity, challenges related to sourcing  products, and risks related to their 
geographic concentration.

Earnings estimates and longer term growth outlook.  We are initiating a 2011 pro forma EPS estimate 
of $0.76 and a 2012 EPS estimate of $0.97.   We think that The Chefs Warehouse is well-positioned to 
generate EPS growth of approximately 17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS 
growth rate is based in part on 7-10% real or organi        c sales growth, relatively co nsistent gross margins, and 
some leverage on the operating expense and interest expense lines.  We also think that selective acquisitions 
could further enhance the companys long-term growth rate. 
 
Company guidance.  Management provided initial guidance for 2011 with their Q2 results on August 25th.  
The company expects 2011 revenue to range from $384-392  million.  The recent acquisition of Harry Wils is 
expected to contribute approximately $10-12 million to   revenue in H2 2011 which is incorporated into the 
companys revenue guidance for the year.  We also note that Q4 2011 has one extra week in the accounting 
period. On the earnings conference call management noted they do not expect to see the rate of inflation, 
which is 4.1% year to date, changing in the back half of the year.  The effective tax rate for the year is expected 
to be 39%.  The company is targeting modified pro forma EPS in 2011 of $0.76-0.79 and GAAP EPS of $0.41-
0.44.   
 
Growth strategies.   The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements:  continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities, further improve operating margins and target selective acquisitions.  We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings.  Management believes they are the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of thei r customers and management  is focused on maintaining 
this position while working to become the primary specialt y distributor for a larger portion of their customers.  
We also think the company has the opportunity to               enhance their distribution network by adding new 
customers in existing markets.  We   think the companys combination of   traditional and specialty product 
offerings coupled with their ability to cultivate strong customer relationships should enable The Chefs 
Warehouse to continue to expand their customer base within existing markets.  The organic growth 
opportunities, if successful, should enhance the oper          ating margin by leveraging   economies of scale in

purchasing, warehousing, distribution and when combined with fixed cost leverage should result in improved 
profitability.  We also think opportunities exist within  the highly fragmented foodservice distribution industry 
for The Chefs Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitio ns which have the potential to expand the breadth of 
the companys distribution network, and further enhance operating efficiencies as well as product offerings 
and other capabilities.   
 
Leading specialty foodservice distributor in key culinary markets.   We think The Chefs Warehouse 
has cultivated strong relationship with their customer s and suppliers both of which have enabled the company 
to become a leading specialty foodse   rvice distributor.  CHEFs distribution network targets key culinary 
markets including New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles, where the company believes 
they are the largest specialty foodservice distributor (based on net sales).  Management believes that these 
markets along with other markets they serve includin    g Las Vegas, Miami, Philad elphia, Boston and Napa 
Valley often shape the culinary trends for the U.S. overall.  The company also believes they currently service 
one or more products to over 60% of their addressable market in the New York metro area and to 20-30% of 
their addressable markets in the other geographies they serve on a weekly basis. Management generally defines 
their addressable or target market as independent restaurants with an average entrée price of over $15.  The 
company services these markets from an efficient network of seven distribution centers, the largest and most 
profitable of which is in New York.  We also think     that CHEFs reputation throughout the industry and 
established relationships with many leading chefs, cu   linary schools and dining outlets has benefited the 
company as they enter new markets.

Chef-driven customer focus.    The Chefs Warehouse focuses on serving the specific needs of chefs at 
leading independent and fine-dining restaurants as opposed to chain restaurants.  In our view, the company 
has built a strong reputation within the specialty food  service distribution industry through their association 
with well known independent restaurants, chefs and culi     nary schools.  We think this strategy helps to 
differentiate the company from many   distribution competitors and enab  les them to fill a rather unique 
position as a leading provider of sp  ecialty food products.  We think the   team of sales professionals at The 
Chefs Warehouse is a key component of their chef-driven customer focus.  The majority of sales professionals 
have received formal culinary training, have degrees in culinary arts and/or have had experience working in 
the culinary industry.   The companys sales force is tr  ained to cultivate relationsh ips with the chefs, ensure 
their needs are met and educate/collaborate with chefs on broader culinary trends.  The Chefs Warehouse 
services over 7,000 customer locations, the majority of which are independent restaurant locations accounting 
for approximately 66% of the companys annual revenue.  We note that their customer base represents just a 
small fraction (around 2%) of all     U.S. independent restaurants.  As of March 31, 2011, there were 
approximately 306,892 independent restaurants in the U.S. based on ReCount data from The NPD Group, Inc. 
which accounted for approximately 53.5% of total U.S. restaurants.

Low customer & supplier concentration.       Since the CHEF business model targets independent 
restaurants we think the company may benefit from less  customer concentration than traditional foodservice 
distributors, particularly those that service chain rest aurants.  During 2010, the companys top 10 customers 
collectively accounted for less than 10% of total net re  venue.  Likewise the company also appears to benefit 
from a low level of supplier concentration with no single supplier representing more than 5% of disbursements.  
The supplier base includes  over 1,000 different suppliers across     North America, Europe, Asia and South 
America.  Their base of suppliers includes many small and family run businesses for which the company may 
be the largest customer.       
 
Extensive portfolio of specialty food products.  We think that The Chefs Warehouse differentiates itself 
within the industry by serving as a premier distributor of  specialty food products both in terms of breadth and 
depth.  The company offers a wide range of food produc  ts in their portfolio which includes basic ingredients 
such as milk, eggs and flour to more specialty items so urced domestically and throug h international markets.   
Some of the specialty items they source include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, 
hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar and chocolate. We think that the companys ability to provide their 
customers with the more exclusive and hard to find spec ialty products is a key point of differentiation for The 
Chefs Warehouse, which also helps their customers feature more distinctive menu offerings.  The company 
carries over 11,500 SKUs in their dist  ribution centers, of which 7,000 are   generally in-stock every day.  In 
comparison, the average specialty distributor carries approximately 1,609 SKUs in their warehouses based on 
data from the Mintel Group, Ltd.  In addition to carrying more SKUs than the average specialty distributor the 
company also offers greater product selection for certain items relative to the large broadline distributors.  The 
company often emphasizes this point using olive oil as an example.  The Chefs Warehouse carries more than 
125 different varieties of olive oil versus the large broadl iners which typically carry only 5-10 different types of 
olive oil.  In our view the companys ability to offer   an extensive selection of high quality specialty foods 
coupled with more traditional staple food products enables The Chefs Warehouse to serve the varying needs 
and drop sizes of their customers.   Additionally, management continually  works with suppliers and importers 
to update their product portfolio in order to stay current with broader culinary trends.

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

 
Acquisition opportunities could  enhance growth potential.    We think that the fragmented and 
consolidating foodservice distribution industry presents  The Chefs Warehouse with acquisition opportunities 
which over time may enhance the comp anys growth potential. During the past several years management has 
pursued and completed tuck-i n and new market acquisitions which have  enabled their business to grow at a 
faster clip than they would have been able to on a stand-alone organic basis.   Management believes they have 
enhanced the operations and profitability of the companies they have acquired in part by leveraging CHEFs 
sourcing capabilities to offer customers an expanded po rtfolio of products, implemen ting more effective sales 
force strategies, and installing enhanced technology    systems.  We note that the $200 billion foodservice 
distribution market (U.S. and Canada  ) is comprised of more than 16,500 distributors according to Sysco 
Corporation (per their December 2010  Investor presentation).  The mark et includes 3,000 distributors with 
revenues of $10-400 million and anot her 13,000 distributors with sales of  less than $10 million annually.  
While not all of these distributors may fit Chefs acquisit ion profile, we think the number is still representative 
of the ample consolidation opportunities within the industry.  In our view the management team of The Chefs 
Warehouse has taken a prudent and selective approach to their acquisition strategy which we view favorably.

Based on managements commentary, it appears that Chicago may be one potentially attractive new market to 
enter as part of their longer-term acquisition strategy.   Management believes that the Chicago market offers 
the most similarity with the New York metro area in   terms of customer concentration which we think allows 
for more efficient customer drops from a distribution and routing perspective.   
 
Recently completed Harry Wils acquisition.    On June 24, 2011, the company completed the tuck-in 
acquisition of Harry Wils & Co. through the purchase of  inventory and certain intang ible assets including the 
companys customer list.  The purcha se price the company paid for Harry Wils & Co. was approximately $7.7 
million (for the intangible assets)  and $1.2 million for the inventory.   Immediately following the close of the 
transaction, the company relocated  the purchased inventory to their di stribution facility in New York.   The 
acquisition was financed with borrowings under the companys revolving credit agreement.   
 
Technology initiatives should im prove operating efficiencies.   Over the past few years The Chefs 
Warehouse has made significant inve stments in distribution, sales, in formation and warehouse management 
systems.  The companys warehouse management system   has been implemented in their main distribution 
facility in New York and the company expects to integrate the system into the rest of their distribution network 
by the end of 2011.  The system provides real-time inventory tracking across the distribution center as well as 
metrics on inventory turns. The company has also be       gun to roll out pick-to-voice technology for their 
warehouse employees in the distribution facilities as well as truck builder which have the potential to enhance 
order fill rates and accuracy.  Management believes th   at the investments they have made in their current 
systems are scalable and can support the companys future growth.   
 
Strong real sales growth.    One of the metrics used to better analyze topline performance is real sales 
growth which strips out revenue contributions from acqu isitions and adjusts for inflation/deflation and other 
factors like mix resulting in a more clear picture of the  core growth of the business.  The following chart shows 
the real or organic sales growth for  The Chefs Warehouse over the past several quarters which has outpaced 
that of Sysco, the largest broadline foodservice distributor in the U.S.  The Chefs Warehouse has achieved real 
sales growth in the low double-digits while Syscos real growth has been in the low single digits.

Attractive margin profile. While the distribution industry is generally characterized as being a low margin 
business, we think The Chefs Warehouse is position       ed to achieve more attractive margins given their 
competitive positioning.  We attribute the companys di      stinct competitive position in large part to their 
customer focus on independent restaurants combined with their product focus on specialty food offerings.  On 
a trailing twelve month basis gross margin for The Chefs Warehouse was 26.2% versus 18.6% for Sysco and

Recently reported qu arterly results.   On August 25, The Chefs Warehouse reported Q2 modified pro 
forma net income of $4.2 million and modified pro form a EPS of $0.20.  The results reflected revenue growth 
of 18.7% to $99.3 million versus $83.6 million last year.  The revenue growth was driven by increased case 
volume and increased revenue  per case.  The sales increase also includ  ed $1.7 million of net sales (or a 2% 
benefit to sales growth) for the Flor  ida operations the company acquired   in June 2010.  Adjusting for the 
acquisition contribution, internal sales growth was 16.7%.  Inflation and mix contributed 3.3% to sales growth.  
Adjusting for inflation and mix, the company posted st      rong real or organic sales growth of 13.4% in the 
quarter.  The gross profit margin increased 50 bps year over year to 26.5% of revenue.  On a GAAP basis, the 
company reported EPS of $0.17 versus $0.13 in the prior year period. 
 
Initial public offering (IPO) and use of proceeds.  On August 2, 2011, The Chefs Warehouse announced 
the completion of its IPO of 10,350,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share.  The company offered 4.7 
million shares and selling shareholde    rs offered 5.7 million shares, incl  uding 1.4 million shares sold to

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

from the sale of primary shares in the offering    (after underwriting fees an d commissions and estimated 
offering expenses).  Management planned to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness.  Following the IPO, 
The Chefs Warehouse entered into a new senior credit facility which includes a $30 million term loan and a 
$50 million revolving credit facility, both maturing in 2015.   At the end of Q1 2011, the companys total debt on 
an as adjusted basis for the offering, use of proceeds, new credit facilities and Harry Wils acquisition was $46.2 
million.   
 
 
Potential Risk Factors 
 
Consumer spending trends.  Since the companys target customer s are restaurants and other foodservice 
establishments, their business is exposed to changes in general economic environment and levels of consumer 
spending. During periods of economic slowdown or       weak consumer spending, restaurants may experience 
weaker sales trends and consumers may choose to spend fewer dollars on discretionary purchases such as food 
away from home.  To the extent that sales for the rest aurants the companys serves are impacted by reductions 
in customer frequency and spending, this can negatively  impact the companys business as their fixed costs are 
then spread over a lower volume of sales.  If the current challenging economic environment continues for an 
extended period of time then consumers may make lo       nger term changes to thei r spending patterns which 
could impact the companys business.   
 
Commodity cost pressures, product sourcing and labor costs.   The company is in part dependent on 
commodities and the ability to respond to changes in f  ood costs, availability, and potential interruptions in 
their distribution network.  The comp any sources a large portion of their sp ecialty food products from local, 
regional, national and international third-party suppliers.   Typically the company does not participate in long-
term contracts with their suppliers nor does the co    mpany use financial instrume nts to hedge their risk 
exposure to fluctuations in the price of certain food   products.  Several factors   can impact food costs and 
availability including weather, crop conditions, government regulation, changes in fuel costs, natural disasters, 
food-borne illnesses, seasonality of  items, transportation costs and other  challenges which may be beyond the 
companys control.  If management is unable to react to food cost fluctuations through their sourcing and 
purchasing practices or identify alternative sources of supply or similar product to meet customers needs then 
the companys business could be negatively impacted by   cost increases and/or the loss of a customer.  The  
results of operations could also be negatively impacted by potential changes in customer perception of the 
quality or selection of their products.  In addition, labor cost fluctuations such as the increases seen with 
minimum wage rate hikes and potential changes in labor legislation could also impact the companys results. 
 
Margins & margin sensitivity.   While The Chefs Warehouse generates profit margins that are generally 
higher than that of a traditional broadline foodservice distributor they may still be considered low relative to 
other industries.  Most of the companys sales are at prices which are based on a product cost plus a percentage 
markup.  Thus, food cost volatility ca n have a direct impact on the companys profitability.   During extended 
periods of product cost inflation, profit margins for Th e Chefs Warehouse may be negatively impacted to the 
extent the company is unable to pass along some or all of  the cost increases to cust omers.  Conversely, during 
deflationary cost periods, profit levels can be negatively impacted even if their gross profit (as a % of sales) 
remains constant and the comp any may need to reduce expenses to compensate for the lower gross margins.  
Therefore, managements inability to respond to cost      pressures (both inflationa ry and deflationary) and 
respond accordingly could have a negative impact on their business or results of operation.   
 
Potential growth of group purchasing organization.      Management has noted th ey have felt some 
pricing pressure from group purchasing organizations which are targeting smaller, independent restaurants in 
an effort to offer them lower prices for products by a  ggregating their purchasing power.  To the extent that 
these organizations are successful in attracting a signif icant number of the compan ys customers as members, 
then management may be forced to lower prices or risk losing business.  Additionally, some of the companys 
customers, including the majority of their hotel cu     stomers, purchase their pr  oducts from The Chefs 
Warehouse through group purchasing organizations. 
 
Geographic concentration.  The companys foodservice distribution operations are concentrated in six key 
culinary markets making The Chefs Warehouse susceptible to changes in economic conditions and other 
developments or events such as adverse weather conditions within these markets.  Their highest concentration 
of sales is in the New York market which accounted     for 66% of net revenues in 2010 making the company 
particularly exposed to potential changes in this region al economy.  A change in the economic conditions or 
disruption in any of these key culinary markets, especi ally New York, could have a material adverse impact on 
CHEFs financial results.  Additionally the companys   operations and distribution  centers in New York and 
Washington D.C. are at risk for adverse winter weather   such as snow and ice, whil e Miami is susceptible to 
hurricanes, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are at ri sk for earthquakes and mudslides.  While management

Consumer health concerns, eating ha bits and government regulation.   As a distributor of food 
products, The Chefs Warehouse is susceptible to negati    ve publicity or news regarding food quality issues, 
public health concerns, illness, and safety.  While ma  nagement has taken steps to  help mitigate such risks 
there can be no guarantee that these types of public driven health concerns can not be entirely eliminated and 
therefore a potential incident could damage the companys  reputation and impact the results of operation.  We 
also think that consumer preferences and eating habits   can be affected by changes in health, diet and food 
regulations which could lead to additional costs for the company if they are required to alter or discontinue the 
sales of certain items in their portfolio.  Consumer preferences can also be impacted by negative publicity 
regarding beef and chicken consumption,  particularly as it relates to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also 
known as BSE or mad cow disease) and avian influenza (also known as bird flu).  Additionally, a widespread 
outbreak of a contagious disease or even the threat of  a widespread outbreak could have a significant negative 
effect on the companys customers and the restaurant in     dustry overall.  In such a scenario, we think that 
restaurant traffic may not only suffer from the potentially large number of individuals who are sick but also by 
a potentially even greater number of otherwise healthy consumers who choose to stay home and avoid public 
places for fear of being infected themselves.  The companys business is also highly regulated at the federal 
level by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and also at the 
state and local level. Potential increases in regulation and compliance related costs could negatively impact the 
companys supplier base as well as the company. 
 
Product liability claims.   The Chefs Warehouse is also at risk of exposure to product liability claims if any 
products they sell cause injury or illness.  While the company has liability insurance it may not be adequate to 
cover potential claims whether actual or alleged nor may the insurance continue to be available at a reasonable 
cost or at all.   Therefore, product liability claims, product recall costs and re  lated matters could have a 
material negative impact of the companys business if it does not have enough insurance or contractual 
indemnification from the manufacturer. 
 
Customer retention and payments.   In general the companys restaurant  customers are not required to 
continue to purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse since the company does not typically engage 
in long-term contracts with their customers.  Thus, there can be no assurance that the volume or number of 
customer orders will not change.  A si  gnificant decrease in the volume or  number of purchase orders from 
existing customers as well as managements inability to   attract new business could have a material negative 
impact on the business.   Additionally the company may experience losses in the event their customers file for 
bankruptcy or are unable to make their payments in a  timely manner which could impact the ability to collect 
their accounts receivable.  This could require management to take larger provisions for bad debt expense.  The 
challenging economic environment may also place greater financial strain on smaller companies like many of 
the companys restaurant and fine dining customers whic h could negatively affect CHEFs results.  However, 
we point out that the companys business is not reli    ant on any one customer as their top ten customers 
collectively account for less than 10% of net revenue thus limiting their customer concentration. 
 
Increases in fuel costs.   As a distributor, The Chefs Warehouse is exposed to increases in fuel costs which 
can have a negative impact of their business.  As the price of diesel fuel rises it can increase the price the

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                           EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

company not only pays for a product from their supplier but also the cost incurred to distribute that product to 
customers.  Thus increases in fuel co sts can have a negative impact on ne t sales, margins, operating expenses 
and results.  During periods of increased fuel cost mana gement has typically been able to pass along at least a 
portion of the higher cost to customers but there can be no guarantee the company will be able to continue to 
do so when necessary.   
 
Competition.  The foodservice distribution industry is highly fragmented.  The company competes with 
smaller distributors on a local and regional level as well as against a few large national broadline distributors 
such as Sysco and U.S. Foodservice with much greater purchasing power.  The companys success is somewhat 
dependent on their ability to meet their customers ne  eds for specialty products and ingredients, as well as 
their desire for high service levels, and timely delivery of products among other factors.  There can be no 
assurance that competitors may not seek to provide specialty products and services which are similar to or 
better than the company.  The Chefs Warehouse may fa  ce increased competition which could lead to price 
reductions, lower gross margins and a loss of market share which could have a material negative impact on the 
business.   
 
Managing future growth.     The companys ability to manage th          eir future growth, whether through 
acquisitions or organically, is anothe r factor that could impact the busine ss and results of operations.  If The 
Chefs Warehouse reaches near maximum capacity at a particular distribution facility the operations of that 
location may be constrained which could lead to inefficien cies unless the facility is expanded or if volume is 
shifted elsewhere.  Likewise if management were to expand an existing facility or bring on additional facilities, 
the excess capacity could lead to inefficiencies.   There can be no guarantee that the company will be able to 
implement the necessary systems (operational, financial  and technology related) to  manage and support their 
employees and the future growth of the business.  Additionally, any damage to existing computer systems or 
the network infrastructure could cause an operational di sruption which could have  a negative impact on the 
business or results of operation. 
 
Acquisition integration.   A substantial portion of the company       s growth has been achieved through 
acquisitions of other specialty food products distri butors. Managements ability to successfully integrate 
acquired companies in the future is  an important factor in determining th e growth potential of the company.  
The Chefs Warehouse expects to expand their presence in existing markets through fold-in acquisitions and 
also enter new markets through new-market acquisitions.  However, there can be no assurance that 
management will be able to successfully identify suitab  le acquisition targets, consummate acquisitions and 
integrate the acquired entities into the company.   The successful integration of an acquired company has many 
facets some of which include maintaining the existing customer base, optimizing delivery routes, managing the 
back office functions and integrating the technology an d personnel systems.  The integration process has the 
potential to distract managements attention and any ch allenges encountered with the transition process could 
have a negative impact on the companys business partic ularly in periods immediately following the closing of 
a transaction.  Additionally the companys ability to  complete acquisitions in the future may hinge upon 
management obtaining the necessary financing which can not be guaranteed. 
 
Dependence on senior management. The companys success is somewhat dependent on the expertise of 
its senior management team, many of whom have extensive experience in the foodservice distribution industry 
and/or with the company. The loss of services of one or  more members of this senior management team or key 
personnel could have a material negative effect on the companys business operations. 
 
Potential sale of restricted shares.  There are about 11.7 million shares of restricted CHEF stock held by 
founders and executive officers which accounts for about 56% of diluted shares outstanding. The potential sale 
of these shares, which are restricted from resale for 180 days following the IPO, could have a material impact 
on the companys stock price. 
 
Financial leverage. The company has a substantial amount of indebtedness.   On an as adjusted basis for the 
offering and use of proceeds and entry into their ne    w credit facilities as of March 25, 2011, CHEF has 
approximately $37.2 million in total debt including $30 million outstanding under their new term loan facility 
and $7.2 million outstanding under th eir new revolving credit facility.   Including the Harry Wils acquisition 
the company has total debt outstanding of $46.2 milli    on, which incorporates an additional $8.9 million 
outstanding under the revolving credit  facility bringing the total outstandin g under the revolver to just over 
$16 million.  A dramatic decline in sales or adverse developments in the credit markets could have a significant 
and detrimental impact on the companys ability meet   the terms of its debt obligations which could have a 
material negative effect on the companys business and financial condition.

KEY INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

We have initiated coverage on Chefs’ Warehouse with a Buy (1) rating and a price target of 
$20.  We view the specialty foodservice distributor as a best-of-breed operator that is well 
positioned to continue to gain market share.  Thus, we have forecasted strong growth in sales 
and earnings for the near and long term.  With a moderately undervalued equity valuation, 
CHEF’s stock presents a timely investment, in our opinion. 
 
Chefs’ boasts industry-leading comparative metrics.   Chefs’ financial and operating 
metrics  compare  favorably  to  those  of  Sysco   (SYY–$27.16–Hold)  and  United  Natural 
Foods  (UNFI–$38.27–Buy).  We have segmented our comparative analytics into three areas 
containing 14 specific measures. In sales and profitability Chefs’ ranked #1, and in operational 
metrics the company ranked #2. CHEF’s LTM sales grew 21% compared to 7.7% for SYY and 
20.3% for UNFI, driven by an 18.1% internal sales growth rate versus 7% for SYY and 13.1% 
for  UNFI.    Even  more  impressive  in  our  view,  Chefs’  ranked  #1  in  four  of  five  selected 
profitability metrics: gross margin, profit margin, ROIC, and GMROI. In terms of operating 
metrics, Chefs’ ranked behind Sysco but above United Natural.  Chefs’ 99% fill rate is in line 
with Sysco and above United Natural’s 97%.  We would argue that Chefs’ boasts the best 
comparative metrics of the three, a rare (but not unprecedented) feat for such a relatively 
small company. 
 
Chefs’ competes in the faster-growing specialty niche of foodservice distribution.   
We  estimate  the  high-end  specialty  foodservice  distribution  addressable  market  at  $22B 
versus  $191B  for  the  entire  foodservice  distribution  industry.    We  forecast  the  long-term 
annual growth rate for specialty foodservice distribution at 5%–6% versus 3%–4% for the 
broad industry.  This market is highly fragmented, and we project Chefs’ target market for 
acquisition at 1,000 firms totaling $18B in annual sales.  
 
Chefs’ is positioned to continue to gain market share.   During the past four years, 
CHEF’s annual top-line growth has averaged 10%.  Our industry analysis places Chefs’ in a 
superior  position  that  reflects  moderately  lower  pricing  levels  versus  smaller  specialty 
distributors, combined with better service and/or assortment levels.  This should continue to 
allow Chefs’ to gain market share in specialty distribution going forward.   
 
We view Chefs’    culture of excellence as its key competitive advantage  based on our 
extensive  channel  checks  with  customers  and  suppliers.    This  emanates  from  a  strong 
management team that combines lengthy experience and a passion for the business.  Other 
key points of competitive differentiation include Chefs’ best-in-class sales team, the majority 
of  whose  members  have  formal  culinary  training,  degrees  in  the  culinary  arts,  or  prior 
experience working in the industry.  Lastly, the average specialty distributor carries about 
1,600 SKUs, which is dwarfed by the 11,500 SKUs that Chefs’ can bring to the table. 
 
Chefs’ has two major avenues of growth—organic and via acquisition.   First, based 
on a sales productivity gap analysis, we project incremental earnings power at Chefs’ less 
productive non-New York facilities at $0.55/sh.  Second, we anticipate that Chefs’ should be 
able to complete on average two acquisitions per year, up from an historical rate of about one 
per   annum.   We   estimate   that   an   increase   in   acquisition   activity   could   contribute   an 
incremental  6%  to  annual  sales  growth  versus  the  3%  historical  average  in  recent  years. 
Because of management’s track record of successfully integrating previous acquisitions, we 
anticipate that EPS contribution would be meaningfully accretive.   
 
We  forecast  strong  top-  and  bottom-line  growth.   For  53-week  2011,  we  forecast 
growth in sales of 19.2% to $393.7M, in operating profit of 42% to $28.7M, and in pro forma 
EPS of 41% to $0.79.  For 2012, we forecast growth in sales at 10% to $433M, in operating 
profit of 20.6% to $34.6M, and in EPS of 23% to $0.97. For 2013, we forecast growth in sales 
of 10.5% to $478.4M, and in EPS of 19% to $1.15. We project free cash flow/sh at $0.55 for 
2012 and $1.00 for 2013.  
 
We view Chefs’ equity as moderately undervalued.   CHEF’s forward P/E ratio based 
on estimated calendar 2012 EPS is 14.0x versus 17.0x for the peer group, or a 18% discount; 
its EV/EBITDA based on forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA is 8.9x versus the group at 9.1x, or 
a 2% discount; its EV/sales based on projected calendar 2012 sales is 0.75x versus the group 
at 0.82x, or a 9% discount. While its valuation metrics are at a moderate discount to its peers, 
we   forecast   that   Chefs’   intermediate-term   fundamentals   will   outperform.      Thus,   we 
recommend aggressive accumulation of its shares at current levels.

                                                  Chefs’ Warehouse is a Best-of-Breed Food Distributor 

                                                  Below we first analyze Chefs’ comparative operating and financial metrics versus two other 
                                                  leading food distributors, Sysco and United Natural Foods.  Chefs’ ranks at or above the other 
                                                  two distributors in the majority of the metrics we measured.  Second, we present results of our 
                                                  proprietary channel checks with Chefs’ customers and suppliers.  Based on these checks, we 
                                                  conclude that qualitatively as well, Chefs’ ranks as a best-of-breed food distributor. 

                                                  Chefs’ Boasts Industry-Leading Comparative Metrics 

Compared to Sysco and                             As shown in  Figure 1, Chefs’ financial and operating metrics compare very favorably to those 

United Natural, Chefs’                            of  Sysco  and  United  Natural.    We  segmented  our  comparative  analytics  into  three  areas 
                                                  containing  14  specific  measures.    In  sales  and  profitability  Chefs’  ranked  first,  and  in 
ranked #1 in sales and                            operational metrics the company ranked second.  We would argue that Chefs’ boasts the best 
profitability and #2 in                           comparative metrics of the three, a rare (but not unprecedented) feat for such a relatively 
operations                                        small company. 
                                                   
                                                  Based on LTM results, CHEF’s total sales grew 21% compared to 7.7% for SYY and 20.3% for 
                                                  UNFI, driven by an 18.1% internal sales growth rate (versus 7% for SYY and 13.1% for UNFI).  
                                                  Even more impressive in our view, Chefs’ ranked first in four of five selected profitability 
                                                  metrics; gross margin, profit margin, ROIC and GMROI. CHEF’s LTM gross margin of 26.2% 
                                                  exceeded  18.6%  for  Sysco  and  18.2%  for  United  Natural,  and  despite  a  19.6%  operating 
                                                  expense ratio (the highest of the three distributors), it generated a 6.6% profit margin versus 
                                                  5% for SYY and 2.9% for UNFI.   CHEF’s ROIC of 33% was above 31.6% for SYY and 17% for 
                                                  UNFI as was GMROI at 4.2x versus 3.8x for SYY and 1.8x for UNFI. 
                                                   
                                                  For most operating metrics Chefs’ ranked behind Sysco but above United Natural.  Chefs’ 99% 
                                                  fill rate is in line with Sysco and above United Natural’s 97%.  CHEF’s LTM sales and gross 
                                                  profit per square foot of $966 and $253, respectively, compared to $1,628 and $303 for SYY 
                                                  and $574 and $104 for UNFI.  Also, Chefs’ achieved LTM revenue per sales associate of $2.9M 
                                                  (versus $4.9M for SYY) and gross profit per sales associate of $753K (versus $915K for SYY).

                                        Chefs’ Competes in Fast-Growth Niche of Foodservice Distribution 

                                        Chefs’ Warehouse competes within the $191B domestic foodservice distribution market.  But 
                                        given its high-end specialty focus, its addressable market is far smaller, which we estimate at 
                                        $22B.  We view the specialty foodservice distribution market as faster growing at an estimated 
                                        secular annual growth rate of 5%–6% versus 3%–4% for all of foodservice distribution. Below 
                                        we present detailed analysis supporting and amplifying these conclusions.  

                                        Addressable Market Size and Growth of Specialty Foodservice Distribution Market 

We estimate the                         We  estimate  the  Chefs’  Warehouse’s  addressable  market  at  $22B.   Foodservice 
                                        distribution  sales  are  derived  from  demand  from  its  customers.    The  largest  customer 
addressable market for high-
                                        segment is the restaurant industry, which makes up 58% of foodservice distribution industry 
end specialty foodservice               volume (see left-hand chart of  Figure 3). The right-hand chart in  Figure 3 shows that of the 
distribution at $22B                    $110B   in   distribution   sales   to   restaurants,   44%   or  $48.4B   is   sold   into   independent 
                                        restaurants, which as a class represent the primary market for  Chefs’ Warehouse.  Chefs’ 
                                        further distinguishes its target as independent restaurants that offer an average entree price 
                                        of $15 or greater.  We believe this sub-group represents roughly one-third, or about $16B in 
                                        purchased goods from foodservice distributors.  To this we add $6B in estimated potential 
                                        sales to natural/gourmet retailers such as  Whole Foods  (WFM–$63.11–Hold), as well as to 
                                        certain caterers, country clubs and other users of high-end foodservice-oriented groceries.

                                        We forecast foodservice establishments’ annual secular growth rate at 3%–4%.   
                                        Since foodservice/restaurants are the largest customer group for distributors, we believe they 
                                        serve  as  the  best  proxy  for  their  derived  demand.    As  shown  in  Figure  4,  year-to-date 
                                        nominal sales growth for foodservice places has risen 5.1% while real growth is up 3%.  This is 
                                        a solid cyclical recovery from the last five-year average growth of 2.9% nominal and 0% real 
                                        and is closer to the prior ten-year period from 1997–2006 (see “Arithmetic Mean” at bottom 
                                        of  Figure 4). We project that secular annual foodservice sector growth is likely to settle at 
                                        3%–4%   nominal   and   0.5%–1%   real;   our   view   is   consistent   with   that   of   industry

annual growth rate for high-            informed by recent survey work by leading market researcher The NPD Group. In May, NPD 
end specialty foodservice               released “The Changing Consumer Mindset: What it Means to the Restaurant Industry.” In 

distribution at 5%–6%                   essence,  NPD’s  surveys  revealed  that  76%  of  consumers  were  “cautious”  and  likely  to  be 
                                        “controlled  spenders”  going  forward  while  24%  were  “optimistic”  and  were  not  likely  to 
versus 3%–4% for the broad              change   their   restaurant   dining   habits.   The   only   common   demographics   among   the 
industry                                “optimistic”  group  were  the  likelihood  of  being  employed  and  affluent—i.e.,  the  target 
                                        customers of high-end restaurants and food retailers.  We think these survey results explain 
                                        the   meaningful   differential   in   growth   trends   among  high-end   and   mid-   and   low-end

                                        Supply Side of Specialty Foodservice Distribution is Very Fragmented 

                                        The U.S. foodservice distribution industry contains some 16,500 firms that generated $191B 
                                        in revenues in 2009.   Figure 5 presents the market segmentation by type of distributor.  The 
                                        three largest companies (Sysco, US Foodservice, and Performance Food Group) account for 
                                        32% of the sales of the market.  Of the remaining 68% of the markets, some $36B, or 19% of 
                                        the  total,  is  transacted  by  smaller  specialty  foodservice  distributors;  this  segment  best 
                                        represents Chefs’ market niche.

We project Chefs’ target                We project Chefs’ target market for acquisition at 1,000 firms totaling $18B in 
                                        annual sales.  We believe that the 2,000 specialty distributors in the United States with 
market for acquisition at 
                                        sales between $10M and $70M are the most suitable acquisition targets for Chefs’. These 
about 1,000 firms totaling              2,000 distributors’ total sales are $36B, putting the average firm’s annual revenue at about 
$18B in annual sales                    $18M.  We assume that one-half cater to the high end of the market sufficiently to make them 
                                        potential  acquisition  candidates  for  Chefs’.  We  estimate  this  equates  to  $18B  in  possible 
                                        acquisition targets for Chefs’ over time; we note this supply-side figure is consistent with our 
                                        estimate of $22B for the total high-end specialty addressable market, which should be the 
                                        case in such a fragmented industry niche.

                                        Chefs’ is Positioned to Continue to Take Share in Specialty Foodservice Distribution 

                                        Industry  structural  analysis  places  Chefs’  in  a  superior  position.     Competition 
                                        within the foodservice distribution industry is mainly based on the quality of the services and 
                                        variety  of  products  offered  versus  the  price  asked  for  those.  Operational  issues  such  as 
                                        reliability and timeliness of deliveries also are highly relevant. We reflect these key attributes 
                                        via a two-dimensional competitive map (see  Figure 6). The vertical axis represents quality of 
                                        service and variety of products, while the horizontal axis represents price.  
                                         
                                        Large broadline distributors such as Sysco, US Foodservice, and Performance Food Group 
                                        traditionally have focused on providing good customer service and product variety at a market 
                                        price and therefore are depicted at the center of the two-dimensional competitive positioning 
                                        map. Chain dedicated distributors such as Martin-Brower (exclusive to McDonald’s) are far 
                                        more price focused, offering fewer services—they are very close to drayage providers and are 
                                        depicted at the lower left quadrant, which represents low service and low price.

                                        Intra-sector Competitive Analysis Favors Chefs’ 

                                        Below, we analyze the key attributes that have fostered this competitive advantage and also 
                                        discuss why large broadline distributors do not pose too great of a competitive threat.  
                                         
Chefs’ offers more than                  Greater product variety.   In most instances, Chefs’ is competing with smaller firms that 
                                        offer many of the 300–400 top-selling SKUs but lack the assortment that allows Chefs’ to 
11,500 products versus 
                                        position itself as both a deeper specialist and a broadliner of necessary commodity goods such 
some 1,600 for a typical                as dairy and flour.  According to market research firm Mintel Group, the average specialty 
specialty distributor                   distributor offers 1,609 products, which is dwarfed by the 11,500 SKUs that Chefs’ can bring 
                                        to the table.  In general, smaller firms are higher priced, but positioned as narrow specialists. 
                                        Thus, in  Figure 6  they are in an inferior position to the right and below Chefs’.  (See pages

                                        Competition from Broadliners is Relatively Benign 

                                        Large broadline distributors also present potential competition for Chefs’.  But as indicated by 
                                        our channel checks, large broadliners appear to lack the deep knowledge and/or sourcing

                                        establishments.  In regards to in-stock selection, large broadliners seem to be limited to those 
                                        specialty SKUs that can sell to their largely family restaurant independent customers. 
                                         
                                        By way of example, Sysco  goes to market in high-end specialty products arena largely through 
                                        its Internet “Chef Ex” portal that allows for direct ordering from vendors without a marketing 
                                        associate’s involvement.  We estimate that Chef Ex carries goods from some 150–160 distinct 
                                        vendors versus more than 1,000 suppliers at Chefs’ Warehouse.  Similar to smaller specialty 
                                        distributors, Sysco’s offering appears limited to the most demanded items.  For example, we 
                                        note that both Sysco’s Chef Ex and Chefs’ Express carry Barry Callebaut’s chocolate and cocoa 
                                        (one of the leading chocolate producers globally).  However, Chef Ex does not carry goods 
                                        from  many  of  the  smaller  artisanal  fine  chocolate  makers  from  which  Chefs’  Warehouse 
                                        sources products. 

                                        Chefs’ Warehouse’s Robust Growth Outlook 

Based on a sales                        Based on its strong competitive position, Chefs’ has two major avenues of growth—organic 
                                        and via acquisition.  Below, we first analyze the strong organic growth potential in optimizing 
productivity gap analysis, we 
                                        capacity of its current infrastructure. Based on a sales productivity gap analysis, we project

power at its non -New York               
facilities at $0.55/sh                  Second, we analyze the outlook for acquisition-driven growth, which we anticipate will be a 
                                        significant and highly accretive feature of the Chefs’ story over time.  While we do not build 
                                        unannounced acquisitions into our financial projections, we anticipate that Chefs’ should be 
                                        able to complete on average two acquisitions per year, up from an historical rate of about one 
                                        per   annum.   We   estimate   that   an   increase   in   acquisition   activity   could   contribute   an 
                                        incremental  6%  to  annual  sales  growth  versus  the  3%  historical  average  in  recent  years. 
                                        Because of management’s track record of successfully integrating previous acquisitions, we 
                                        anticipate that the EPS contribution would be accretive.  As we analyze below, the amount of 
                                        accretion would vary greatly depending on whether the deal was a fill-in or new market entry.  

                                        Maximizing Profits of Current Distribution Infrastructure 
                                        In our view, Chefs’ major opportunity to maximize earnings of its distribution infrastructure 
                                        is by growing market share in non-New York regions, which are far less productive than its 
                                        New York assets.  We believe this is understandable given the company has operated in New 
                                        York for 26 years and in the other markets from 7–12 years.   Figure 7 shows that 59% of the 
                                        company’s revenue was generated in the greater New York market and the remaining 41% at 
                                        six other regions from five facilities.  (New England is currently served from the Bronx, while 
                                        the other five markets have dedicated distribution centers.)

Growing share by penetration of existing customers. By virtue of its far longer market 
presence in New York, Chefs’ boasts far greater share of wallet with customers there. Thus, in 
newer markets, Chefs’ has the opportunity to add SKUs that are already successful in New 
York to gain penetration. For example, Chefs’ offers its New York customers some 160 SKUs 
of frozen seafood, while in Los Angeles it carries 15 at present. Our channel checks confirm 
that this process of gaining penetration with existing customers is ongoing, even in its more 
penetrated New York/New Jersey market that continues to gain share of wallet. 
 
Growing share with new customer wins.  Chefs’ gains access to new customers based on 
its  industry  knowledge  and  experience  and  relationships  with  leading  culinary  thought 
leaders.  We believe the company’s reputation as the leading distributor of  specialty food 
products in key culinary markets is a strong calling card.  The markets Chefs’ serves and many 
of the chefs with which it collaborates set culinary trends for the rest of the United States.  
This provides valuable insights into changing culinary and menu practices that over time have 
resulted in new customer wins. 
 
Robust   gross   margins   allow   for   strong   operating   leverage   with   increased 
product offerings.   Chefs’ has boosted its product offerings to 11,500 currently from 6,000 
in 2007.  Further some 2,000 to 3,000 new SKUs come in and go out of its system each year 
as demand and culinary trends change. As shown in  Figure 8, this has served Chefs’ well as 
we estimate that all of its major categories carry healthy gross margin rates. We anticipate 
that the company will continue to augment its offerings both by adding depth to existing 
categories and breadth by entering new categories.  Historically, this has occurred organically 
and via acquisitions, and we would anticipate both to continue going forward.

Sales productivity based gap analysis—robust earnings power at non-New York 
facilities.  In  Figure 9, we present a sales productivity based gap analysis that is intended to 
demonstrate   the   robust   earnings   power   of   the   company’s   non-New   York   facilities.   
Essentially, the analysis projects earnings power if these facilities were to reach the same sales 
productivity (as measured by sales per square foot) as the New York facilities.  Our analytic 
conclusion is that EPS would increase by $0.55.

                                                          were generated from the Bronx facilities (59% in greater New York and 8% in New England), 
                                                          which made sales productivity (sales per sq ft) there 2.3x that of the rest of the business.  In 
                                                          our experience analyzing retail and distribution food merchants, we have found that EBIT per 
                                                          sq ft has a geometric relationship to sales per sq ft.  In other words, food merchandisers with 
                                                          greater  sales  productivity  generate  disproportionately  greater  profit  dollars  and  margins.   
                                                          This is the power of the well-known productivity loop shared by most best-in-class merchants.  
                                                          Lastly,  we  note  that  our  estimation  process  includes  the  conservative  assumption  that 
                                                          corporate expenses are allocated on a pro rata (with sales) basis.  Management believes that 
                                                          only the Los Angeles market presents structural challenges to achieving like profitability on 
                                                          like sales productivity, given the region’s inherently greater distribution stem miles.

                                                          We are bullish on Chefs’ strategy to ramp up acquisitions. First, the company’s reputation for 
                                                          excellence precedes it when it enters new markets; simply put, many potential customers are

                                                          acquisitions. We have found that this combination of cultural and systems excellence is the 
                                                          best predictor of success for acquisitions for food merchandisers. 
                                                           

We believe Chefs’ has                                     Track  record  of  success.     As  shown  in  Figure  10,  recently  Chefs’  has  consummated 
                                                          acquisitions at about a rate of one per year.  These have served three purposes: new market

We estimate an increase in                Acquisition sales growth could ramp to 6% annually, EPS accretion to vary by

acquisition activity could 
                                          sales growth versus the 3% average in recent years.  We anticipate that EPS contribution 
contribute 6% to annual                   would vary by the type of deal with acquisitions in existing markets being more immediately 
sales growth versus the 3%                accretive than in new markets.  We estimate that a 6% incremental sales growth acquisition 
average in recent years                   could add some $0.08–$0.12 to near-term EPS if it were a tuck in an existing market and 
                                          $0.02–$0.05 to near-term EPS for new market entry. Over time we would expect the new 
                                          market acquisition to mature to a similar EPS contribution rate as for tuck-in deals. 
                                           
On a normalized basis, we                 Harry Wils deal illustrates accretion of tuck-ins.   On June 24, 2011, Chefs’ closed its

project the Harry Wils 
                                          distribution and corporate facilities, was completed in less than a week.  Further, most of 
acquisition will be $0.09/sh–             Wils’ $22M in LTM sales was retained. As shown in  Figure 13, on a normalized basis, we

this kind of tuck-in                      be 33%–45%.  We view this kind of tuck-in acquisition as the best use of Chefs’ capital going

COMPANY BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION 

Headquartered  in  Ridgefield,  CT,  The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.,  is  the  nation’s  premier 
importer and distributor of specialty food products. Chefs’ client-base includes more than 
7,000  independent  restaurants,  hotels,  casinos,  private  clubs,  caterers,  food  distributors, 
culinary schools, and specialty food stores.  Because of this diversification, the top ten clients 
accounted for less than 10% of net revenue totaling $330M in 2010.  By sales, independent 
restaurants are the largest customer segment (65%), followed by hotels and casinos (9%), food 
retailers (7%), private clubs (6%), and caterers (4%).   
 
On average, Chefs’ fills 11,000 orders per week at fill rate of 99% , a result of a first-
class  logistics  platform  and  nationwide  footprint  of  distribution  centers.    Chefs’  seven 
distribution  centers,  fleet  of  138  delivery  trucks  (all  leased),  and  six-day-a-week  delivery 
schedule (in most markets) gives Chefs’ the ability to deliver various drop sizes in a timely 
manner, typically within a two- to three-hour window.  Most orders are filled within 12–24 
hours.    The  company  employs  571  hourly,  salaried,  and  commissioned  employees  (which 
includes 125 sales professionals) with a target sales professional-to-client ratio of 1-to-65.   
 
Strong distribution infrastructure.  As detailed in  Figure 14, Chefs’ Warehouse leases 
seven distribution centers in six markets: New York; Washington, DC; Miami; Las Vegas; Los 
Angeles; and San Francisco.  Chefs’ two Bronx-based distribution centers comprise 47% of the 
company’s 372K square footage ,  followed by an 80K-square-foot facility in Los Angeles.  The 
company anticipates relocating its Miami operations to a 27,000 square foot facility (from 
10,000 square feet currently) in Q3’11.  
 
Chefs’   is   the   largest   distributor   of   specialty   food   products   in   New   York; 
Washington, DC; San Francisco; and Los Angeles .  The company supplies at least one 
product per week to 60%+ of NYC addressable markets and 20%–30% in the remaining five

                                        Chefs’ robust technology platform allows the company to better leverage its cost 
                                        structure.    Over   the   past   three   years   (2007–2010),   Chefs’   expense   ratio   improved 
                                        (contracted) 333 bps, which was significantly better than the 55 bps contraction at SYY and 49 
                                        bps  contraction  at  UNFI.    These  systems  have  been  crucial  to  Chefs’  ability  to  efficiently 
                                        integrate acquisitions.  Chefs’ completed the integration of Harry Wils & Company’s inventory 
                                        and systems in a 48-hour period, a feat few (if any) competitors can duplicate.  We believe the 
                                        company’s investment in technology will continue to be a key driver of Chefs’ profit growth.  
                                         
                                        The Chefs’ Warehouse uses Roadnet , a UPS-developed routing and logistics planning 
                                        software program designed to reduce routing time, lower distribution costs, improve resource 
                                        utilization,  and  monitor  driver  and   vehicle  performance.    Roadnet’s  GPS  and  vehicle 
                                        monitoring software tracks driver progress relative to delivery schedules and monitors 500 
                                        key vehicle metrics such as hard braking, idling, and fast starts.  This system also enables 
                                        Chefs’ to create dynamic routing which minimizes miles driven without sacrificing service.  
                                         
                                        The  company  also  utilizes  a  state-of-the-art  warehouse  management  system, 
                                        currently  integrated  in  the  primary  Bronx  distribution  center  with  full  integration  in  the 
                                        remaining  six  distribution  centers  expected  by  Q1’12.    This  system  provides  real-time 
                                        inventory visibility and is used in conjunction with advanced forecasting tools to maintain 
                                        optimal inventory levels.  Additionally, the company uses a truck builder dimensional-based 
                                        pallet technology that builds pallets based on weights and sizes, thus, maximizing delivery

                                       better  balance  between  growth  in  gross  profits  and  market  share.    This  software  uses 
                                       advanced forecasting algorithms based on historical data, which optimizes pricing and has a 
                                       robust capacity of up to 600,000 price segmentations.  The company is halfway through its 
                                       rollout and expects to begin utilizing the software in late Q3.

                                        •   Tax adjustment (assuming a 39% tax rate) to normalize the 2010 effective tax rate  
                                         
                                        EPS.  On this basis, Chefs’ Q2’11 EPS grew 33% to $0.20 from $0.15 in the prior-year period.  
                                         
                                        Sales.    For Q2’11, sales increased 18.7% to $99.3M from $83.6M in the prior-year period on 
                                        increased case volume and higher revenue per case.  Real internal sales contributed 13.4% 
                                        (versus  12%  in  the  prior-year  period)  while  sales  inflation  and  mix  contributed  3.3%  and 
                                        acquisitions 2%. 
                                         
                                        Gross Profit.   Q2’11 gross margin expanded 21 bps to 26.45% from 26.24% due to improved 
                                        margin on sales of protein items and the receipt of a multiyear customs rebate (increased 20 
                                        bps).  Gross profit dollars increased 19.6% to $26.3M from $21.9M in the prior-year period. 
                                         
                                        SG&A Expense.   For Q2’11, operating expenses increased 14.2% yr/yr to $19M while the 
                                        corresponding  ratio  contracted  75  bps  to  19.11%  from  19.86%,  driven  by  improved  cost 
                                        controls and operating leverage from strong sales.  Results included $200K of non-recurring 
                                        costs from the recently closed Harry Wils acquisition. 
                                         

                                                                                                                               19 of 31

Operating Profit.   Q2’11 operating  profit rose 36.5% to $7.3M from $5.3M in the year ago 
period while the related ratio expanded 95 bps to 7.34% from 6.39%.  Adjusted EBITDA was 
$8.1M versus $6.2M in Q2’10 while the related margin expanded 78 bps yr/yr to 8.19%.   
 
Net Income.   Net interest expense fell 18.6% to $0.4M while other income was nil versus a 
$0.2M loss in the year-ago period.  The effective tax rate expanded 10 bps to 39.1%, resulting 
in net income of $4.2M, up 35.1% from $3.1M in the similar period last year.   

Financial Forecasts 

Our  quarterly  and  annual  income  statement  projections  are  presented  on  pages  25–26, 
followed by our balance sheets and cash flow estimates on pages 27 and 28, respectively.  
Below we discuss the assumptions underlying our financial forecasts.   

Income Statement, Capital Expenditures, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Our income statement forecasts are predicated on the following general assumptions: 
•   Strong organic sales growth supplemented by announced acquisitions (we do not model 
    for unannounced acquisitions) 
•   Stable to slightly rising gross margins 
•   Contracting expense ratios driven by leveraging fixed costs 
•   Free cash flow is applied to pay down debt 
 
Company guidance—53-week 2011 and long-term EPS growth 
Management recently set 53-week 2011 financial guidance that included: 
•   Sales of $384M–$392M, up 16.3%–18.7% 
•   GAAP EPS of $0.41–$0.44 
•   Pro forma EPS of $0.76–$0.79 
The company had previously provided long-term:  
•   Organic revenue growth of 7%–10% in existing markets 
•   Consistent gross margins 
•   Operating and interest expense leverage 
•   Organic EPS growth of 17.5% 

2011 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Income Statement.   For 53-week 2011, we forecast sales growth of 19.2% to $393.7M from 
$330.1M in 2010, driven by internal sales growth of 12.6% yr/yr, 4.2% yr/yr growth from 
acquisitions and another 2.4% from the 53rd week.  We estimate gross profit growth of 20.7% 
to $103.5M from $85.8M and gross margin expansion of 32 bps to 26.3% from 25.98% in 
2010.  We project a 14.1% increase in SG&A costs to $74.8M from $65.6M and an 86 bps 
contraction of the corresponding ratio to 19% from 19.86% in the prior year.  Consequently, 
we forecast 2011 operating profit of $28.7M, up 42.1% from $20.2M in the prior year.  As a 
percent of sales, we project operating margin expansion of 118 bps to 7.3% in 2011 from 6.12% 
in 2010.  We project 2011 EBITDA of $30.3M, up 35.8% from $22.3M in the prior year.  We 
estimate net interest expense of $1.7M and a 10 bps expansion of the tax rate to 39.1% from 
39%.  Thus, we forecast net income of $16.5M, up 42% from $11.6M in 2010. We estimate 
diluted shares outstanding at 20.8M; thus, we forecast 53-week core EPS of $0.79.  On a 
calendarized basis (to 52 weeks), our 2011 forecast is $0.77.  
   
Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow.   We estimate 2011 cash capital expenditures 
of $1.5M, up 32% from $1.1M in 2010, driven by the relocation in warehouse operations in 
Miami.  We forecast the Harry Wils acquisition and miscellaneous investments will put total 
capital costs at $10M.  We project cash flow from operations at $13.5M in 2011. Thus, free 
cash flow is projected to total $3.5M, or $0.17/sh. 

2012 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Income  Statement.     For  2012,  we  forecast  sales  growth  of  10%  to  $433M,  driven  by 
internal sales growth of 9.5% yr/yr, a 2.7% contribution from acquisitions, partly offset by a 
2.2% drag from comparing with 53-week 2011.  We estimate gross profit gains of 9.8% to 
$113.7M from $103.5M and gross margin contraction of 5 bps to 26.25%.   We project a 5.6% 
increase in SG&A costs to $79M from $74.8M and a 75 bps contraction of the corresponding 
ratio to 18.25% from 19% in the prior year.  Consequently, we forecast 2012 operating profit of 
$34.6M, up 20.6% from $28.7M in the prior year.  As a percent of sales, we project operating 
margin expansion of 70 bps to 8% in 2012 from 7.3% in 2011.  We forecast 2012 EBITDA of 
$36.4M, up 20% yr/yr.  We estimate a 25.1% decline in net interest expense, to $1.3M and a 
10 bps contraction in the tax rate to 39%.  Thus, we forecast net income of $20.3M, up 23% 

                                                                                  20 of 31 

                                                                                             359
---------------------Page 360---------------------

                                                                                                                                   

                                       from  $16.5M  in  2011.    Diluted  shares  outstanding  are  estimated  to  total  21M;  thus,  we 
                                       forecast 2012 EPS of $0.97.  
                                          
                                       Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow.   We estimate 2012 cash capital expenditures 
                                       of $8.5M, as we anticipate the company will consolidate both NY distribution centers into a 
                                       larger facility.  We project cash flow from operations at $20M in 2012. Thus, free cash flow is 
                                       projected to total $11.5M, or $0.55/sh. 

                                       2013 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 
                                       Income Statement.    For 2013, we forecast sales growth of 10.5% (all internal) to $478.4M.  
                                       We estimate gross profit growth of 10.7% to $125.8M and gross margin expansion of 5 bps to 
                                       26.3%.  We project an 8.1% increase in SG&A costs to $85.4M and a 40 bps contraction of the 
                                       corresponding ratio to 17.85% from 18.25% in the prior year.  Consequently, we forecast 2013 
                                       operating profit of $40.4M, up 16.7% from $34.6M in the prior year.  As a percent of sales, we 
                                       project operating margin expansion of 45 bps to 8.45% in 2013 from 8% in 2012.   We forecast 
                                       2013 EBITDA of $42.3M, up 16.3% yr/yr.  We estimate a 63% decline in net interest expense 
                                       to $0.5M.  Thus, we forecast net income of $24.4M versus $20.3M in 2012.  We estimate 
                                       diluted shares outstanding at 21.2M; thus, we forecast 2013 core EPS of $1.15.  
                                          
                                       Capital   Expenditures   and   Free   Cash   Flow.     We   project   that   2013   cash   capital 
                                       expenditures  of  $2M  on  anticipated  facility  maintenance  and  $0.7M  of  miscellaneous 
                                       investments will put total capital costs at $2.7M.  We forecast cash flow from operations at 
                                       $24M in 2013. Thus, free cash flow is estimated to total $21.3M, or $1/sh.  

                                       VALUATION 

                                       We View Chefs’ Warehouse as Modestly Undervalued 

Chefs’ Warehouse appears               As shown in  Figure 23, based on the primary valuation metrics we normally use, Chefs’ 
                                       Warehouse appears moderately undervalued versus the median valuation for its peer group of 
moderately undervalued 
                                       leading  food  merchandisers.    Specifically,  CHEF’s  forward  P/E  ratio  based  on  estimated 
versus the median valuation            calendar 2012 EPS is 14.0x versus 17.0x for the group, or a 18% discount; its EV/EBITDA 
for its peer group of leading          based on forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA is 8.9x versus the group at 9.1x, or a 2% discount; 
food merchandisers                     its EV/sales based on projected calendar 2012 sales is 0.75x versus the group at 0.82x, or a 
                                       9% discount. 
                                        
                                       UNFI is the group member that we think is the best direct comparable for CHEF.  CHEF 
                                       trades at a 23% discount to UNFI on forecasted calendar 2012 P/E and an 8% discount on 
                                       forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA, but an 92% premium on forecasted 2012 sales.  Given that 
                                       we forecast CHEF’s 2012 EBITDA margin at 8.4% versus 4% for UNFI, we consider CHEF’s 
                                       valuation premium based on EV/sales appropriate. 

                                       Intermediate-Term Fundamentals Stronger than Peers 
                                       While  most  of  its  standard  valuation  metrics  are  at  a  moderate  discount  to  its  peers,  we 
                                       forecast  that  Chefs’  intermediate-term  fundamentals  will  outperform.    For  example,  we 
                                       forecast calendar 2012 yr/yr EPS growth for CHEF of 26% versus 16% for the group median 
                                       and Chefs’ calendar 2012 yr/yr EBITDA growth at 20% versus 15% for the group median.   

                                       We Derived Our $20 Price Target Using a Forward P/E Methodology 
                                       We generally apply forward P/E valuation methods to growth stocks, and we certainly view 
                                       Chefs’ that way.  Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF’s will ultimately be 
                                       revalued up to the group median of 17.0x calendar 2012 EPS from 14.0x currently.  
                                        
                                       Thus,   we   have   applied   the   group   median   multiple   to  derive   our   $20   price   target. 
                                       Mathematically,  we  take  the 17.0x  group  multiple  and  apply  it  to  our  calendar  2013  EPS 
                                       forecast of $1.15 to yield our $20 price target. 
                                        
                                        

                                                                                                                           21 of 31

RISKS 

We view the following as important risk factors regarding an investment in CHEF and to 
achieving our price target.  

Cyclicality of Demand Tied to High End Consumer Sentiment 

Chefs’ revenue is closely correlated to consumer sentiment among high-end consumers.  As 
shown in  Figure 24 , during the 2008/2009 recession, Chefs’ experienced four sequential 
quarters of negative internal sales growth that averaged –9.6%.  This was closely linked to a 
steep decline in the Luxury Consumption Index during that period.  Conversely, CHEF’s sales 
rapidly improved (with about a 6 month lag) to the recovery in the Index since then. 
 
Despite the severity of the downturn of 2008/2009, Chefs’ earnings rose during that period as 
it nimbly right-sized the business and completed two accretive acquisitions.  Aided by the 
flexibility of employing a non-union work force, the company eliminated 10% of its fleet with 
an associated reduction in drivers, warehouse labor, and G&A expenses.

Concentration of Business in Greater New York 

Chefs’ greater New York market, which spans from Boston to Atlantic City, accounted for 65% 
of 2010 sales.  Risks associated with this concentration include potential adverse regional 
economic trends and potential catastrophic events.   
 

                                                                                       23 of 31

Fuel Price Inflation  
Year to date, we estimate that Chefs’ fuel costs have averaged 70 bps of sales (or 50 bps net of 
fuel surcharges to customers). As detailed in  Figure 25, this is similar to 81 bps for UNFI and 
60 bps for SYY.  We estimate a $0.10/gallon increase in fuel would increase Chefs’ pretax fuel 
expenses by $75K; thus a $1/gal increase would negatively impact EPS by just $0.02.

Product Cost Inflation and Relative Pricing Power 

Investor concern regarding food merchandisers’ ability to pass through inflating product costs 
is both a perceived and potentially real risk. As shown in  Figure 26, Chefs’ adjusted gross 
margin expanded 21 bps and 43 bps, respectively, in Q2’11 and Q1’11. This compares favorably 
to respective contractions 57 bps and 27 bps for SYY.  Over the long term, CHEF has normally 
had  stronger  pricing  power  than  SYY  as  well.    Only  during  2008  did  CHEF  materially 
underperform SYY when its margin contracted 55 bps and SYY was flat.

Acquisition-Related Risks 
Chefs’ strategy to substantially grow via acquisitions entails certain risks. The two generic 
risks associated with horizontal acquisitions are around execution and asset quality. While 
Chefs’ history of successful acquisitions does not preclude it from these risks in the future, we 
believe it does suggest a company that is highly capable of navigating potential pitfalls.  Based 
on its strong management team and information systems, we view execution risk as relatively 
minor in the intermediate term.  Risks around asset quality can often, but not always, be dealt 
with via valuation (i.e., pay more for better companies and less for weaker ones).  Regardless, 
we  believe  management  must  remain  diligent  to  avoid  acquisitions  that  could  materially 
dilute Chefs’ culture of excellence. 

CONCLUSION 

We view Chefs’ Warehouse as well positioned to continue to gain market share in the specialty 
foodservice distribution sector.  Thus, we have forecasted strong growth in sales and earnings 
for the near and long term.  With a moderately undervalued equity currently, CHEF’s stock 
presents a timely investment, in our opinion.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating is 
determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to the 12-
month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best estimate of the 
market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of numerous assumptions, 
including company, industry, and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and relative basis, as well as investor sentiment, 
which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                                      EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

Company Description: 

The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
United States. The company's core customers are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments, as well as country clubs, hotels, catere        rs, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The 
company distributes more than 11,500 food products, incl uding an extensive selection of distinctive and hard-
to-find specialty items, to over 7,000 customer locations in the United States. 
 
Key Investment Points 
 
We initiated coverage with an Outperform rating on the shares.  We initiated coverage of The Chefs 
Warehouse with an Outperform rating  on the shares, which reflects current valuation, as well as our favorable 
view of the companys competitive positioning within the foodservice distribution industry. We believe that 
CHEF is poised for growth given the companys presence in key culinary markets, combined with its customer 
focus on serving the needs of chefs at independent restau rants and its product focus of sourcing specialty food 
offerings. We also think that the   companys growth potential could be   further enhanced through selective 
acquisition opportunities. 
 
Share valuation. CHEF shares are trading at 14.0x our 2012 EPS  estimate, versus a multiple of 15.8x for the 
peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of  17%. On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading 
at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.5x. Over the next 12 months, we believe that CHEF 
shares warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a mu ltiple of 20-21x our 2012 EPS estimate. In our view, 
key risk factors that could affect share valuation incl      ude the inability to successfu lly integrate acquisitions, 
sales and commodity volatility, challe nges related to sourcing products,   and risks related to the companys 
geographic concentration.

Earnings estimates and longer-term growth outlook. We initiated with a 2011 pro forma EPS estimate 
of $0.76 and a 2012 EPS estimate of $0.97. We think that  The Chefs Warehouse is well positioned to generate 
EPS growth of approximately 17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS growth rate 
is based in part on 7-10% real or organic sales growth, relatively consistent gross margin, and some leverage on 
the operating expense and interest expense lines. We also think that selective acquisitions could further 
enhance the companys long-term growth rate. 
 
Company guidance. Management provided initial gu idance for 2011 with its Q2  results on August 25. The 
company expects 2011 revenue to range from $384 million   to $392 million. The recent acquisition of Harry 
Wils is expected to contribute approximately $10-12 milli       on to revenue in H2 2011, which is incorporated into 
the companys revenue guidance for the year. We also note that Q4 2011 has one extra week in the accounting 
period. On its earnings conference call, management noted that it does not expect to see the rate of inflation, 
which is 4.1% year to date, changing in H2. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be 39%. The 
company is targeting modified pro forma EPS in 2011   of $0.76-0.79 and GAAP EPS of $0.41-0.44. We were 
encouraged by managements commentary during its Q2 earnings conference call in late August that the 
business momentum had continued thus far into Q3 despite recent macro events.  
 
Growth strategies.  The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements: continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities,  further improve operating margin, an d target selective acquisitions. We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings. Management believes that CHEF is the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of its cu stomers and management is focused on maintaining this 
position while working to become the  primary specialty distributor for a larger portion of its customers. We 
also think the company has the opportunity to enhance its distribution network by adding new customers in 
existing markets. In our view, the companys combinat            ion of traditional and spec  ialty product offerings, 
coupled with its ability to cultivate strong customer        relationships, should enable The Chefs Warehouse to 

 
                                                                                                                                                   3 
                                                                                                                                                    373

Restaurants & Foodservice                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 
 
continue to expand the base of customers within existing markets. The organic growth opportunities, if 
successful, should enhance the operating margin by levera ging economies of scale in purchasing, warehousing, 
distribution, and, when combined with fixed cost levera  ge, should result in improv ed profitability. We also 
think opportunities exist within the highly fragmented     foodservice distribution industry for The Chefs 
Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitions that have the potential to expand the breadth of the companys 
distribution network and further enhance operating ef     ficiencies, as well as product offerings and other 
capabilities.  
 
Leading specialty foodservice distri butor in key culinary markets.  We think The Chefs Warehouse 
has cultivated strong relationships  with its customers and suppliers, both of which have enabled the company 
to become a leading specialty foodservice distributor.    CHEFs distribution network targets key culinary 
markets including New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where the company believes 
that it is the largest specialty foodservice distributor (based on net sales). Management believes that these 
markets, along with other markets it serves, includin  g Las Vegas, Miami, Philad elphia, Boston, and Napa 
Valley, often shapes the culinary trends for the United States overall. The company also believes that it 
currently services one or more products to more than  60% of its addressable mark et in the New York metro 
area and to 20-30% of its addressable markets in the other geographies it serves on a weekly basis. 
Management generally defines its addressable or target market as independent restaurants with an average 
entrée price exceeding $15. The company services these markets from an efficient network of seven 
distribution centers, the largest and most profitable  of which is in New York. We also think that CHEFs 
reputation throughout the industry an d established relationships with many  leading chefs, culinary schools, 
and dining outlets has benefited the company as it enters new markets.

Chef-driven customer focus.  The Chefs Warehouse focuses on serving the specific needs of chefs at 
leading independent and fine-dining re staurants, as opposed to chain restaurants. In our view, the company 
has built a strong reputation within the specialty foodse rvice distribution industry through its association with 
well-known independent restaurants, chefs, and culinary sc hools. We think this strate gy helps to differentiate 
the company from many distribution competitors and enables them to fill a rather unique position as a leading 
provider of specialty food products.  We think the team of sales profession als at The Chefs Warehouse is a key 
component of the companys chef-driven customer focu       s. Most sales professionals have received formal 
culinary training, have degrees in culinary arts, and/or  have had experience working in the culinary industry. 
The companys sales force is trained to cultivate relation ships with the chefs, ensure  that their needs are met, 
and educate and collaborate with chefs on broader culinary trends. The Chefs Warehouse services more than 
7,000 customer locations, the majority of which are       independent restaurant lo cations, accounting for 
approximately 66% of the companys annual revenue. We note that the companys customer base represents 
just a small fraction (around 2%) of all U.S. independent restaurants. As of March 31, 2011, there were 
approximately 306,892 independent restaurants in the United States based on ReCount data from The NPD 
Group, Inc., which accounted for approximately 53.5% of total U.S. restaurants.

Low customer and supplier concentration.      Since CHEFs business model targets independent 
restaurants, we think the company may benefit from le ss customer concentration th an traditional foodservice 
distributors, particularly those that service chain rest aurants. During 2010, the  companys top ten customers 
collectively accounted for less than 10% of total net revenue. Likewise, the company also appears to benefit 
from a low level of supplier concentration, with no        single supplier representing more than 5% of 
disbursements. The companys supplier base includes       more than 1,000 different suppliers across North 
America, Europe, Asia, and South America. CHEFs base   of suppliers includes many small and family-run 
businesses for which the company may be the largest customer. Across product categories the company also 
stocks multiple products from multiple suppliers in order to further reduce its reliance on any single supplier.

Extensive portfolio of specialty food products.  We think that The Chefs Warehouse differentiates itself 
within the industry by serving as a premier distributor of  specialty food products both in terms of breadth and 
depth. The company offers a wide range of food products  in its portfolio, which includes basic ingredients such 
as milk, eggs, and flour to more specialty items sourced domestically and through international markets. Some 
of the specialty items that it sources include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars,

hormone-free proteins, truffles, caviar, and chocolate. Through its importing division, the company sources 
items from more than 40 countries including Italy,    Spain, France, and other Mediterranean countries. We 
think that the companys ability to  provide its customers with the more exclusive and hard-to-find specialty 
products is a key point of differentiation for The Chef s Warehouse, which also  helps its customers feature 
more distinctive menu offerings. Th e company carries more than 11,500 SKUs in its distribution centers, of 
which 7,000 are generally in stock ev    ery day. In comparison, the aver    age specialty distributor carries 
approximately 1,609 SKUs in its warehouses based on data from the Mintel Group, Ltd. In addition to carrying 
more SKUs than the average specialty distributor, the co mpany also offers greater product selection for certain 
items relative to the large broadline foodservice distributors. The company often emphasizes this point using 
olive oil as an example product. The Chefs Warehouse carries more than 125 different varieties of olive oil 
versus the large broadliners, which typically carry only 5-10 different types of olive oil. In our view, the 
companys ability to offer an extensive selection of high -quality specialty foods, coupled with more traditional 
staple food products, enables The Chefs Warehouse to se rve the varying needs and drop sizes of its customers. 
In addition, management continually works with suppliers and importers to update its product portfolio in

In addition to offering gourmet brands, The Chefs Warehouse also features proprietary brands, which 
represent about 15% of sales and generate higher margin for the company. The private brands are available for 
certain staple products such as bulk olive oil, Italian grating cheeses, and butter.

Acquisition opportunities coul d enhance growth potential.   We think that the fragmented and 
consolidating foodservice distribution industry presents  The Chefs Warehouse with acquisition opportunities, 
which, over time, may enhance the companys growth potential. During the past several years, management 
has pursued and completed tuck-in and new market acquis itions, which have enabled its business to grow at a 
faster clip than it would have been able to on a stand-alone, organic basis. Management believes that it has 
enhanced the operations and profitability of the compan  ies it has acquired, in part  by leveraging sourcing 
capabilities to offer customers an expanded portfolio of products, implementing more effective sales force 
strategies, and installing enhanced technology systems.  We note that the $200 billion foodservice distribution 
market (the United States and Cana da) is comprised of more than 16,5  00 distributors, according to Sysco 
Corporation (per its December 2010 Investor presentation). The market includes 3,000 distributors with 
revenue of $10-400 million, and anothe  r 13,000 distributors with sales of   less than $10 million annually. 
While not all of these distributors may fit Chefs acquisit ion profile, we think the number is still representative 
of the ample consolidation opportunities within the industry. In our view, the management team of The Chefs 
Warehouse has taken a prudent and selective approach to its acquisition strategy, which we view favorably.

Based on managements commentary, it appears that Chicago may be one potentially attractive new market to 
enter as part of its longer-term acquisition strategy. Ma nagement believes that the  Chicago market offers the 
most similarity with the New York metro area in terms   of customer concentration, which we think allows for 
more efficient customer drops from a distribution and  routing perspective. Other potential new markets could 
include Atlanta, Texas, Denver, and Phoenix.  
 
Recently completed Harry Wils acquisition.   On June 24, 2011, the company completed the tuck-in 
acquisition of Harry Wils & Co. through the purchase of  inventory and certain intangible assets, including the 
companys customer list. The purchase price the company paid for Harry Wils & Co. was approximately  
$7.7 million (for the intangible asse ts), and $1.2 million for the inventor y. Immediately following the close of 
the transaction, the company relocated the purchased inve  ntory to its distribution facility in New York. The 
acquisition was financed with borro wings under the companys revolving credit agreement. On the companys 
Q2 earnings call in late August,       management commented that it has            not seen much customer attrition 
following the acquisition, and that the business  had been tracking very close to managements expectations.

Distribution platform.  Currently, the companys distribution network consists of seven distribution 
centers, a list of which follows, and a truck fleet that  fills an average of 11,000 or ders per week. The company 
provides service six days per week to customers in many markets and leases its truck fleet from both national 
and regional leasing firms. Products are generally delivere d to the companys distribution facilities by its truck 
fleet, contract carriers, or directly from the supplier. Customer orders come in throughout the day via phone, 
email, or fax, and are sent to the shipping department. The orders are input into computer programs, which 
send pick tickets to the warehouse. Warehouse employees then drive around the facility picking the necessary 
items and placing the products on pallets, which are then loaded onto the trucks based on a pre-determined

delivery sequence. The company utilizes routing and logi stics planning software, which helps to maximize the 
number of daily deliveries from each facility, and also   enables the company to make those deliveries within 
each customers preferred time window. In the companys New York facilities, drivers arrive at the warehouse 
around 3-4am to pick up the customer invoices before departing in the loaded trucks to begin making 
customers deliveries.

Most of the trucks and trailers used for delivery fe   ature separate temperature- controlled compartments for 
products varying refrigeration needs. The companys truck fleet is monitored using GPS and vehicle 
monitoring systems to continually assess the trucks conditions and also analyze driver performance. One of 
the companys main goals is to efficiently fill and delive r a customers order, typically within 12-24 hours from 
the time of order placement.

Technology initiatives should  improve operating efficiencies.  Over the past few years, The Chefs 
Warehouse has made si gnificant investments in dist ribution, sales, information, and warehouse management 
systems. The companys warehouse management system  has been implemented in CH EFs main distribution 
facility in New York, and the company expects to integrat e the system into the rest of its distribution network 
by the end of 2011. The system provides real-time inventory tracking across the distribution center, as well as 
metrics on inventory turns. The company has also begun  to roll out pick-to-voice technology for its warehouse 
employees in the distribution facilities, as well as truc k builder, which have the potential to enhance order fill 
rates and accuracy. Management  believes that the investments it has ma de in its current systems are scalable 
and can support the companys future growth.  
 
Strong real sales growth.  One of the metrics used to better analyze top-line performance is real sales 
growth, which strips out revenue cont ributions from acquisitions and adju sts for inflation or deflation, and 
other factors, like mix, resulting in a more clear pictur e of the core growth of the business. The following chart

Attractive margin profile.   While the distribution industry (food          service and grocery wholesaling) is 
generally characterized as being a low-margin business,       we think The Chefs Warehouse is positioned to 
achieve more attractive margins given its competitiv       e positioning. We attribute the companys distinct 
competitive position in large part to its customer focu s on independent restaurants, combined with its product 
focus on specialty food offerings.  On a trailing-12-month basis, gross ma rgin for The Chefs Warehouse was 
26.2%, versus 18.6% for Sysco, and  18.2% for United Natural Foods. The  operating margin was 6.7% for The 
Chefs Warehouse, versus 5.0% for Sysco, and 2.9% for United Natural Foods on the same basis.

Recently reported quarterly results.  On August 25, The Chefs Warehouse reported Q2 modified pro 
forma net income of $4.2 million and modified pro form a EPS of $0.20. The results reflected revenue growth 
of 18.7%, to $99.3 million, versus $83.6 million last year. The revenue growth was driven by increased case 
volume and increased revenue  per case. The sales increase also includ  ed $1.7 million of net sales (or a 2% 
benefit to sales growth) for the Flor  ida operations the company acquired  in June 2010. Adjusting for the 
acquisition contribution, internal sales growth was 16.7 %. Inflation and mix contributed 3.3% to sales growth. 
The drivers of the food cost inflation were mainly dairy,  oils, and seafood. Adjusting for inflation and mix, the 
company posted strong real or organic sales growth of  13.4% in the quarter. The gr oss profit margin increased 
50 bps year over year, to 26.5% of revenue. Management attributed most of the basis-point expansion to 
higher margins on the sale of protein offerings, driven by customer and product mix shift. Operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales improved 60 bps year over year , reflecting leverage on higher sales. On a GAAP basis, 
the company reported EPS of $0.17, versus $0.13 in the prior-year period.

Cash flow and capital expenditure.  The company is targeting capital spending in the $1.0-2.0 million 
range for 2011 and the $7.5-9.0 million range for 2012. Management anticipates funding these expected needs 
with cash from operations and borrowings under its revo  lving credit facility. For 2011, the capital spending 
range includes costs related to additional square footage for the Miami operations buildout in Q3. The 
significant ramp-up in projected capital spending for 20 12 primarily relates to managements plans for a new 
and expanded distribution facility project in New York.  We are targeting for the company to generate positive 
free cash flow of $16.1 million and $13.7 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Initial public offering (IPO) and use of proceeds. On August 2, 2011, The Chefs Warehouse announced 
the completion of its IPO of 10,350,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share. The company offered 4.7 
million shares and selling shareholde       rs offered 5.7 million shares, incl     uding 1.4 million shares sold to 
underwriters to cover overallotments. The company received approximately $63.1 million in net proceeds from 
the sale of primary shares in the o  ffering (after underwriting fees an d commissions, and estimated offering 
expenses). Management planned to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness. Following the IPO, The Chefs 
Warehouse entered into a new senior credit facility, wh ich includes a $30 million term loan and a $50 million 
revolving credit facility, both maturi ng in 2015. At the end of Q1 2011, the companys total debt on an as-
adjusted basis for the offering, use of proceeds, new credit facilities, and Harry Wils acquisition  
was $46.2 million.  
 
 
Company History 
 
The company was founded in 1985 as Dairyland USA Corporation. At that time, the company was primarily a 
distributor of butter and eggs, as well as some specialty  food products to chefs in the New York metropolitan 
area. From 1985 to 2000, the compan y focused on becoming a leading spec ialty food distributor in the New 
York market by offering high levels of customer serv      ice and providing a differentiated product portfolio. Since 
1999, the company has entered five new markets, th             e first of which was Washington, D.C., through a 
Greenfield development. In 2005, the acquisition of Van Rex Gourmet Foods gave the company a presence in 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las  Vegas. The companys most recent ne w market entry was Miami in 2010, 
with the acquisition of the assets of Monique & Me, Inc.  During its 26-year history, The Chefs Warehouse has 
grown to become a leading distributor of specialty food pr oducts, with a presence in six of the nations leading 
culinary markets. By focusing on specialty food prod         ucts and serving the specific needs of chefs at many 
leading independent restaurants, we think customers have come to rely on The Chefs Warehouse as an 
ingredients company or a virtual pantry.

Potential Risk Factors 
 
Consumer spending trends.  Since the companys target customers  are restaurants and other foodservice 
establishments, its business is exposed to changes in general economic environment and levels of consumer 
spending. During periods of economic slowdown or   weak consumer spending, restaurants may experience 
weaker sales trends and consumers may choose to spend fewer dollars on discretionary purchases such as food 
away from home. To the extent that sales for the restaurants the companys serves are affected by reductions in 
customer frequency and spending, this can hurt the comp anys business as its fixed co sts are then spread over 
a lower volume of sales. If the current challenging economic environment continues for an extended period of 
time, then consumers may make longer-term changes to their spending patterns, which could affect the 
companys business.  
 
Commodity cost pressures, prod uct sourcing, and labor costs.  The company is, in part, dependent 
on commodities and the ability to respond to changes in food costs, availability, and potential interruptions in 
its distribution network. The company sources a large    portion of its specialty food products from local, 
regional, national, and international third-party suppliers . Typically the company neither participates in long-
term contracts with its suppliers, nor uses financial inst ruments to hedge its risk exposure to fluctuations in 
the price of certain food products. Seve ral factors can affect food costs and availability including weather, crop 
conditions, government regulation, changes in fuel costs,  natural disasters, food-borne illnesses, seasonality of 
items, transportation costs, and other challenges that may be beyond the companys control. If management is 
unable to react to food cost fluctuations through its sourcing and purchasing practices, or identify alternative 
sources of supply or similar product to meet custom     ers needs, then the companys business could be 
negatively affected by cost increases and/or the loss of   a customer. The results of operations could also be 
negatively affected by potential changes in customer perc eption of the quality or selection of its products. In 
addition, labor cost fluctuations, such as the increases seen with minimum wage  rate hikes and potential 
changes in labor legislation could also affect the companys results. 
 
Margin and margin sensitivity.  While The Chefs Warehouse generates profit margins that are generally 
higher than that of a traditional broadline foodservice di  stributor, it may still be considered low relative to 
other industries. Most of the companys sales are at prices that are based on a product cost plus a percentage 
markup. Thus, food cost volatility can have a direct im  pact on the companys profit ability. During extended 
periods of product cost inflation, profit margins for The Chefs Warehouse may be negatively affected to the 

 
                                                                                                                                11

Restaurants & Foodservice                                                             EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 
 
extent the company is unable to pass along some or all  of the cost increases to cu stomers. Conversely, during 
deflationary cost periods, profit levels can be negatively affected even if the companys gross profit (as a % of 
sales) remains constant an d the company may need to reduce expens  es to compensate for the lower gross 
margin. Therefore, managements inability to respond to  cost pressures (both infl ationary and deflationary) 
and respond accordingly could have a negative impact on its business or results of operation.  
 
Potential growth of group purchasing organization.   Management has noted that it has felt some 
pricing pressure from group purchasing organizations, which are targeting smaller, independent restaurants in 
an effort to offer them lower prices for products by  aggregating their purchasing power. To the extent that 
these organizations are successful in attracting a signif icant number of the compan ys customers as members, 
then management may be forced to lower prices or risk losing business. In addition, some of the companys 
customers, including the majority of its hotel customer s, purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse 
through group purchasing organizations. 
 
Geographic concentration. The companys foodservice distribution operations are concentrated in six key 
culinary markets, making The Chefs Warehouse susceptible to changes in economic conditions and other 
developments or events, such as adverse weather conditions within these markets. Their highest concentration 
of sales is in the New York market, which accounted    for 66% of net revenue in 2010, making the company 
particularly exposed to potential chan ges in this regional economy. A chan ge in the economic conditions or 
disruption in any of these key culinary markets, especi ally New York, could have a material adverse impact on 
CHEFs financial results. In addition, the companys   operations and distribution centers in New York and 
Washington, D.C. are at risk for adverse winter weather   such as snow and ice, whil e Miami is susceptible to 
hurricanes, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are at ri sk for earthquakes and mudslides. While management 
has disaster recovery plans in the event of a temporary closure or destruction of the companys distribution 
facilities, there can be no guarantee that such an event would not significantly affect the results of operations.

Consumer health concerns, eating habits, and government regulation.    As a distributor of food 
products, The Chefs Warehouse is susceptible to negative publicity or news regarding food-quality issues, 
public health concerns, illness, and safety. While mana  gement has taken steps to help mitigate such risks, 
there can be no guarantee that these types of public-driven health concerns can not be entirely eliminated, and 
therefore, a potential incident could  damage the companys repu tation and hurt the results of operation. We 
also think that consumer preferences and eating habits   can be affected by changes in health, diet, and food 
regulations, which could lead to additional costs for the   company if it is required to alter or discontinue the 
sales of certain items in its portfolio. Consumer preferences can also be affected by negative publicity regarding 
beef and chicken consumption, particularly as it relates to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also 
known as mad cow disease, and avian influenza, also known as bird flu. In addition, a widespread outbreak of a 
contagious disease or even the threat of a widespread ou tbreak could have a significant negative effect on the 
companys customers and the restaurant  industry overall. In su ch a scenario, we think that restaurant traffic 
may not only suffer from the potentia lly large number of individuals who are sick, but also by a potentially

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                            EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

even greater number of otherwise healthy consumers who choose to stay home and avoid public places for fear 
of being infected themselves. The companys business is also highly regulated at the federal level by the Food & 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and also at the state and local 
level. Potential increases in  regulation and compliance-related cost s could negatively affect the companys 
supplier base, as well as the company. 
 
Product liability claims.  The Chefs Warehouse is also at risk of ex posure to product liability claims if any 
products it sells cause injury or illn ess. While the company has liability in surance, it may not be adequate to 
cover potential claims whether actual or alleged, or  the insurance might not continue to be available at a 
reasonable cost, or at all. Therefore, product liabilit  y claims, product recall costs, and related matters could 
have a material negative impact on the companys business if it does not have enough insurance or contractual 
indemnification from the manufacturer. 
 
Customer retention and payments.  In general, the companys restaurant customers are not required to 
continue to purchase their products from The Chefs Warehouse since the company does not typically engage 
in long-term contracts with its cust  omers. Thus, there can be no assura  nce that the volume or number of 
customer orders will not change. A si  gnificant decrease in the volume or  number of purchase orders from 
existing customers, as well as managements inability to attract new business, could have a material negative 
impact on the business. In addition, the company may experience losses in the event that its customers file for 
bankruptcy or are unable to make their payments in a timely manner, which could hamper the ability to collect 
their accounts receivable. This could  require management to ta ke larger provisions for bad debt expense. The 
challenging economic environment may also place greater  financial strain on smaller companies, like many of 
the companys restaurant and fine dining customers, wh ich could negatively affect CHEFs results. However, 
we point out that the companys business is not re     liant on any one customer, as its top ten customers 
collectively account for less than 10% of net revenue, thus limiting CHEFs customer concentration. 
 
Increases in fuel costs.  As a distributor, The Chefs Warehouse is exposed to increases in fuel costs, which 
can have a negative impact on its business. As the price of diesel fuel rises, it can not only increase the price the 
company pays for a product from its supplier, but also      the cost incurred to distribute that product to 
customers. Thus, increases in fuel co sts can have a negative impact on ne t sales, margins, operating expenses, 
and results. During periods of increa sed fuel cost, management has typically been able to pass along at least a 
portion of the higher cost to customers, but there can be no guarantee the company will be able to continue to 
implement fuel surcharges when necessary. Management has indicated that fuel expenses generally represent 
about 70 bps of operating costs.

Competition.  The foodservice distribution industry is highly fragmented. The company competes with 
smaller distributors on a local and regional level, as well as against a few large national broadline distributors 
such as Sysco and U.S. Foodservice wi th much greater purchasing power. The companys success is somewhat 
dependent on its ability to meet its customers needs for specialty products and ingredients, as well as its desire 
for high service levels and timely de livery of products, among other factor s. There can be no assurance that 
competitors may not seek to provide specialty products and services that are similar to or better than the 
companys. The Chefs Warehouse may face increased competition, which could lead to price reductions, lower 
gross margin, and a loss of market share, which could have a material negative impact on the business.

Managing future growth. The companys ability to manage its future growth, whether through acquisitions 
or organically, is another factor that could affect the business and results of operations. If The Chefs 
Warehouse reaches near maximum capacity at a particular  distribution facility, the operations of that location 
may be constrained, which could lead to inefficiencies  unless the facility is expanded or volume is shifted 
elsewhere. Likewise, if management were to expand an existing facility or bring on additional facilities, the 
excess capacity could lead to inefficiencies. There can be no guarantee that the company will be able to 
implement the necessary systems (operational, financial,  and technology related)  to manage and support its 
employees and the future growth of the business. In addition, any damage to existing computer systems or the 
network infrastructure could cause an operational disr  uption, which could have a   negative impact on the 
business or results of operation. 
 
Acquisition integration.  A substantial portion of the companys growth has been achieved through 
acquisitions of other specialty food products distri butors. Managements ability to successfully integrate 
acquired companies in the future is  an important factor in determining th e growth potential of the company. 
The Chefs Warehouse expects to expand its presence in existing markets through fold-in acquisitions and also 
enter new markets through new-market acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that management 
will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisit  ion targets, consummate acquisitions, and integrate the 
acquired entities into the company. The successful inte gration of an acquired company has many facets, some 
of which include maintaining the existing customer base, optimizing delivery routes, managing the back-office 
functions, and integrating the techno logy and personnel systems. The inte gration process has the potential to 
distract managements attention, an d any challenges encounte red with the transition process could have a 
negative impact on the companys business, particular  ly in periods immediately following the closing of a 
transaction. In addition, the companys ability to co  mplete acquisitions in th  e future may hinge upon 
management obtaining the necessary financing, which can not be guaranteed. 
 
Dependence on senior management. The companys success is somewhat dependent on the expertise of 
its senior management team, many of whom have extensive experience in the foodservice distribution industry 
and/or with the company. The loss of services of one or  more members of this senior management team or key 
personnel could have a material negative effect on the companys business operations. 
 
Potential sale of restricted shares.  There are about 11.7 million shares of restricted CHEF stock held by 
founders and executive officers, which accounts for about 56% of diluted shares outstanding. The potential sale 
of these shares, which are restricted from resale for 180 days following the IPO, could have a material impact 
on the companys stock price. 
 
Financial leverage. The company has a substantial amount of inde btedness. On an as adjusted basis for the 
offering and use of proceeds and entry into its new credit facilities as of March 25, 2011, CHEF has 
approximately $37.2 million in total  debt, including $30 million outstandin g under its new term loan facility 
and $7.2 million outstanding under its new revolving credit facility. Includ ing the Harry Wils acquisition, the 
company has total debt outstanding of $46.2 million      , which incorporates an additional $8.9 million 
outstanding under the revolving credit  facility, bringing the total outstand ing under the revolver to slightly 
more than $16 million. A dramatic decline in sales or adverse developments in the credit markets could have a 
significant and detrimental impact on the companys abil ity to meet the terms of its debt obligations, which 
could have a material nega  tive effect on the companys business and financial condition. Based on the 
companys new credit facilities, management has noted that a 100-basis-point increase in market interest rates 
would lower after-tax earnings by approximately $300,000, assuming other variables remain constant.  
 
Foodservice Distribution Industry Overview 
 
The foodservice distribution industry is a large and extremely fragmented industry, which serves the 
restaurant sector. There are two primar y types of foodservice distributors: broadline distributors and specialty 
distributors. The following table lists the top ten broadline foodservice distribution companies, according to ID 
Report. Sysco Corporation, U.S.  Foodservice and Performance Food Grou p are the three largest broadline 
distributors in the United States.

Customer base.  There are two principal types of restaurant cu  stomers that foodservice distributors serve: 
traditional independent operators and  multi-unit chain operators. Tradit ional operators include independent 
restaurants, hotels, cafeterias, schools, healthcare facilities, and other institutional operators. Multi-unit chain 
customers are operators of regional             and national quick-service, casual dining, and fine dining restaurant 
chains. Many broadline distributors service both customer segments, while others focus more on one customer 
type. Foodservice distributors generally  refer to their traditional independ ent restaurant customers as street 
accounts and multi-unit customers as  chain accounts. Following are some of the key differences between 
street and chain accounts, and how they are serviced.   
 
•    Street accounts. These are typically characterized by more freque nt and smaller deliveries of products 
     to independents restaurant operators in close proxim                  ity to a distribution facility. A companys street 
     business normally has to inventory a much larger numb er of products (SKUs) th an the chain operations. 
     Street accounts are very competitive since one customer may be serviced by multiple distributors versus 
     having one dominant supplier in the chain business.  Customer relationships can be very important in the 
     street business, due to the competitive nature of the supplier base.  
      
•    Chain accounts.  These are generally characterized by less frequent, higher-volume deliveries of a 
     narrow range of products. These products are tailored to meet the needs of a whole chain of restaurants in 
     a broad geographic area. Chain accounts require a high level of customer service since they rely on one 
     distributor for nearly all of their food products. Distri butors with chain operations often have large trucks 
     dedicated to servicing large,  long-distance deliveries to chain acco  unts. As a result, deliveries to chain 
     accounts are normally more efficient than street accounts and lead to lower operating expenses as a 
     percentage of sales, which offsets lower gross margins for chain accounts.

Sales drivers. Foodservice distributors employ a variety of methods to drive sales, including existing account 
penetration, the addition of new customer accounts, and external growth from acquisitions. While sales growth 
is mostly driven by changes in volume, it can also be affected by changes in commodity prices from inflation 
and deflation. For instance, periods of  inflation may increase the dollar value of the companys sales. Likewise 
periods of deflation may lower the dolla r value of sales, while the unit sale s may remain the same or actually 
increase. Some companies will break out the componen        ts of their sales growth including inflation and 
acquisitions to provide a clearer picture of the organic growth of the business. 
 
•   Existing account penetration.  By increasing sales to existing cust omers, distributors can internally 
    drive sales growth and operating margin improvements by leveraging fixed costs. One way distributors 
    penetrate existing accounts is through the introduc    tion of new product categories. Distributors also 
    generate sales growth from existing   relationships by capitalizing on    the unit growth of multi-unit 
    customers.   
 
•   New customer accounts.   One of the main ways distributors co           ntinue to drive their sales is by 
    establishing new customer accounts. Companies ofte      n increase their sales force as they obtain new 
    customers to enhance the level of service.  
 
•   External growth.  There are two main types of acquisition st       rategies distributors use to externally 
    expand their operations: tuck-in and new market. In ge     neral, a tuck-in or fold-in strategy is used to 
    describe the acquisition of competing distributors with  in existing areas of oper ations or in contiguous 
    regions. These companies may have  complementary customer bases or  product offerings. With a new 
    market acquisition, a distributor is seeking to expand  operations to a new and attractive geographic area 
    and leverage the strengths of the combined companies to improve market share and profitability.  
 
Profitability drivers. Several factors can affect the profitability of  distributor sales, in cluding delivery size, 
delivery frequency, customer mix, product mix, and information systems.  
 
•   Delivery size.  In general, the larger the delivery size, the more profitable the account is since the 
    majority of delivery expenses are fixed. When a delivery size is increased, the fixed costs are then spread 
    over a larger size order and the profitability is improved.       
 
•   Delivery frequency.  The timing of delivery varies for each customer since it largely depends upon a 
    restaurants inventory base, storage, and refrigeration capacity, and product freshness requirements. In 
    general, fewer, larger size deliveries result in im  proved truck utilization and lower operating expenses. 
    While decreasing the frequency of each delivery increases the profit per drop, the distributors are limited 
    in their ability to control this factor.   
 
•   Customer mix.  There are two main customer segments that foodservice distributors principally serve: 
    traditional independent op erators and multi-unit chains. The traditional independent operators are 
    typically referred to as street accounts, while multi- unit chains are called chain accounts. Chain accounts 
    generally rely on one distribution company for the      majority of their purchasing needs. While chain 
    accounts can lead to higher volume, they also result   in lower gross margins for the distributors. Higher 
    gross margins can be derived from the street accounts since independent operators do not have the 
    purchasing strength of the larger chains restaurants.  Thus, street accounts are generally more profitable 
    on a gross margin basis.      
 
•   Product mix.  Distributors divide their product offerings   into two principal categories: private label 
    brands and regional and national brands. Private label products serve as an alternative to the normally 
    higher-priced regional and national brands of comparable quality. Higher gross margins are generated 
    from proprietary label products, and therefore, it is more profitable for  distribution companies to increase 
    private label sales as a percentage of overall product mix.  
 
•   Information systems.  The sophistication of a distributors management information system can also 
    affect a companys margins. A more advanced system can lead to improved margins by enabling a 
    company to operate more efficiently with lower internal costs.

Restaurant Industry Overview 
 
Linked to the restaurant industry. By providing food and food-related products to a variety of restaurant-
type establishments, foodservice distributor revenue is tied to food away from home sales growth trends.  
 
Our overall restaurant sector outlook for 2011 has been   cautious, as we remain concerned about consumer 
spending pressures tied to high unemployment and bloated consumer debt levels. We believe that consumer 
spending pressures will continue to weigh on restaurant        traffic trends until we see a significant shift in 
consumer confidence (which may not happen until the employment situation shows further improvement). 
The unemployment rate peaked at 10% in Q4 2009 and is forecasted to remain at more than 9% in 2011-13, 
according to the September 2011 forecast by Wells Fargos Economics Group.

From a segment perspective, we think the casual-dining segment could be the most heavily exposed restaurant 
category to consumer spending headwinds over the ne  xt year. In our view, restaurant supply and demand 
dynamics, while improving, may contin ue to weigh on a potential recovery   for the segment. Casual dining 
concepts may continue to fight for market share from   each other until demand prospects improve. We think 
the quick-service restaurant (QSR) segment may be better  positioned to benefit from some trade-down given 
the relatively lower menu price points . We also think that significant impr ovements to food quality and menu 
breadth over the past few years has increased consumer relevance of the QSR sector and expanded the 
customer demographic. International expansion opportunities also represent an attractive growth vehicle for 
many of the leading QSR chains. While some economic he  adwinds continue to persist, the fine dining group 
could be positioned to benefit if business-related spendi  ng remains fairly resilient.  Some fine-dining chains 
derive a majority of their sales from business-related travel and corporate spending.  
 
Restaurant Industry Sales Forecasts 
 
Based on the latest forecast (as of May 2011) from Te chnomic Information Services, total restaurant sales are 
forecasted to increase 2.6% in 2011 on a nominal basi s (versus 2.3% from  the January 2011 forecast). For the 
restaurant industry overall, we are encouraged by Technomic, Inc.s forecast for continued sales growth in 2011 
on a nominal basis, though it is below historical tr    end levels for both the limited-service and full-service 
restaurant segments. The 2011 forecast reflects slightly  positive nominal sales growth of 3.5% for the limited-
service segment (up from 2.5% previously) and 1.5% growth for the full-service segment (down from 2.0% 
previously). Adjusting for Technomic s assumed inflation rate of 2.5%, th      e real growth forecast is 1% for 
limited service and negative 1% for full service.

Restaurant Demand Trends  
 
CREST survey data from The NPD Grou  p shows that restaurant traffic tr ends have softened, suggesting the 
environment remains challenging. Overall restaurant tra ffic trends weakened sequentially and turned slightly 
negative for the three months ended June 2011, as shown  in the following graph. The return to negative traffic 
reflects more weakness in the full-service segment, while the quick-service segment has held steadier.

More favorable view of restau  rant sector pricing power relative to grocery stores.     We have 
greater confidence in restaurant sector pricing power relative to grocery stores in the current environment, 
based in part on recent inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate of inflation for food at home 
has been steadily rising and is tracking higher than the       rate of inflation for food away from home, as shown in 
the following graph. Given this trend,  we think restaurant companies may be better positioned to pass along 
menu price increases to consumers as they compete against grocery stores for consumers food dollars. The 
CPI for food at home is forecasted to  increase 3.5-4.5% in 2011, versus a 3.0-4.0% expected increase for food 
away from home based on the July 2011 forecast from the USDAs Economic Research Service. As part of our 
demand analysis, in our restaurant  supply and demand outlook we are us ing inflation assumptions of 3.0% 
and 2.5% for food away from home for 2011 and 2012, respectively.

In our view, restaurant companies with the ability to           take some menu pricing       while still maintaining a 
compelling price/value offering should  be best positioned to compete in 2011. Most restaurant companies we 
cover have taken some menu pricing th         is year to help cover at least a portion of the impact from rising 
commodity pressures. Overa ll, the approach to pricing appears to be conservative as companies remain 
focused on balancing price/value in a prolonged weak consumer spending environment.  
 
Commodity Cost Environment 
 
We expect commodity inflation for the restaurant sector to  continue this year, but at a moderated pace relative 
to 2010. The American Restaurant Association (ARA) is forecasting an indexed commodity cost increase of 6% 
on a full-year basis in 2011, which would come on to          p of a 14% increase in 2010. For 2012, the ARA is 
forecasting indexed commodity costs to  increase 2% on a full-year basis            following two years of significant 
inflation.

projections for corn and soybean crop yields due to poor growing conditions. This is expected to lead to record-
high feed costs over the next 12 mo nths, meaning commodity production growth will likely be limited in 2012. 
Drought conditions in Texas  and nearby states have forced producers to bring cattle to market earlier given 
challenging pasture conditions and feed supplies, which  will likely limit 2012 supplies and beef output. If the 
drought conditions do not improve, the ARA expects winter wheat plantings this fall to be reduced. 
 
The following table shows wholesale inflation and deflation by major restaurant commodity item. For 2011, 
chicken is forecasted to be down, while most other categories are expected to be up, including beef, cheese, 
potatoes, grains, and eggs.

About The Restaurant Commodity Index.    The Restaurant Commodity In  dex is comprised of eight 
subindices based on restaurant type and their menu mix across key food categories ranging from ground beef 
and chicken breasts to cheese, french fries, pasta, and produce. The eight restaurant types include casual 
dining, fast casual, fast food, Italian, mexican, pizza, steakhouse, and wing restaurants. The indices are based 
on spot commodity market inflation and do not includ                    e any contracting assumptions. The index is updated 
monthly by the American Restaurant Association. 
 
 
Restaurant Supply And Demand 
 
The number of U.S. restaurants contracted 1.6% yr/yr,   or by 9,450 units, according to Spring 2011 ReCount 
data from the research firm The               NPD Group. We attribute the unit                contraction to the prolonged weak 
consumer spending environment and high unemployment   rate, which have contribu ted to sales and traffic

The NPD Group compiles unit count data for restaurants twice per year. The spring data, as of March 31, 2011, 
show that the number of independent restaurants declin ed 2.7% yr/yr, while the number of chain restaurants 
declined 0.3%. Relative to trends from  spring 2010 and fall 2010, the spring 2011 data reflect a greater degree 
of contraction for independents, as well as a shift to contraction for chains.  
 
We view the directional move in the spring data as an   overall positive for the industry, as further contraction 
should help strengthen the supply and demand balance. We could see the overall supply and demand balance 
moving further into positive territory by the end of 20  11, assuming continued contraction in the supply base 
and a pickup in demand.

Supply And Demand By Segment 
 
We have broken down our main restaurant industry su pply and demand graph to provide a better picture of 
restaurant segment trends. The following graphs illust rate supply and demand tren ds for the full-service and 
quick-service restaurant segments, with the latter showing a healthier supply and demand balance. 
  
Full-service supply and demand.  In 2011, we think the supply and demand balance for the full-service 
segment has the potential to come into balance and turn   positive in 2012; however, this hinges on continued 
contraction in supply and improvement in demand.

Quick-service supply and demand.  We see demand continuing to exceed supply for the limited-service 
segment in 2011 and 2012, reflecting a continuation of sl  ightly positive real sales growth trends and a slight 
contraction in the supply base for 2011, followed by flat supply growth in 2012.

For purposes of our supply and demand analysis, restaura  nt demand refers to the year-over-year growth in 
real restaurant sales (nominal sales adjusted for food       away from home inflation), while restaurant supply 
refers to the year-over-year unit growth for restaurants. The spread or balance refers to the difference between 
the demand and supply growth, with a positive numb          er being favorable (demand exceeding supply) and a 
negative number being less favorable   and indicating a period of oversuppl  y, or imbalance. The restaurant 
industry supply data are based upon a September fiscal year-end, with a midyear update as of March each year.

Supply Trends -- Chains Versus Independents 
 
While the operating environment remains challenging fo       r chains and independents, chains appear to be 
managing through it better than independents, with the  growth in the supply of chain restaurants declining a 
slight 0.3% and the supply of independents declining 2.7% as of the Spring 2011. As illustrated in the following 
figures, supply trends for chain restaurants have outpaced independent restaurants, which have contracted for 
eight out of the past ten years. We have seen a gradua  l pullback in overall chain su pply over the past several 
years, with growth slowing to turning slightly negative as of the Spring 2011 from 3.5% in 2005.

Chain advantages over independents.    In our view, chain restaurant              s possess several competitive 
advantages relative to their independent counterparts that serve to benefit chains over the long term. We think 
that these advantages can be seen through greater purchasing power, stronger employee programs, easier 
access to capital allowing for the purchase of prime real estate and unit expansion, and advertising efficiencies. 
We also think that casual dining chains may be bett     er positioned to enhance consumer relevance through 
product and service innovation. In our  view, on a combined basis, these fact ors can make it more difficult for 
independent restaurants to successfully compete against  the larger chains, adding support to our outlook for 
continued contraction of the independent restaurant base  in the United States. That being stated, independent 
restaurants still account for the majority of restaurants in  the United States, with a market share of 53% as of 
spring 2011. However, as shown, the market share for independent restaurants has gradually decreased from 
60% in 2002, which we expect to continue over the long term.

obtains information on unit location from both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include direct 
input from chain headquarters, Internet directories, and telephone contact for confirmation and reconciliation. 
Secondary sources include financial reports, commercial mailing lists, government information, and telephone 
directories. ReCount categorizes rest aurants by service type and food sp ecialty within the quick-service and 
full-service restaurant segments. We no te that the unclassified category  within the full-service segment is a 
default category for units that are not  categorized as casual dining, family dining, or fine dining. Nearly all of 
the units in the unclassified segment are independents, the majority of which are also low-volume operators.  
 
ReCount releases two updates annually showing restaurant  unit counts as of the end of March and September. 
The Spring 2011 release is based on restaurants open as  of March 31, 2011, and includes restated data for the 
prior-year periods. We note that starting with ReCounts Fall 1998 release, the total number of units being 
reported is about 4-5% higher than figures reported   through ReCount in prior releases, due to a complete 
refurbishing of the database to increase coverage of the U.S. Restaurant market.

                                 Company description.      Ridgefield, Connecticut-based Chefs Warehouse is a distributor of 
                                 specialty food products to menu-driven independ  ent restaurants, fine dining establishments, 
                                 country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. Reported sales in 
                                 FY2010 were $330.1 million. The company serves its 7,000 customer locations through six 
                                 distribution centers in New York City (representing ~66% of sales, and ~80% of EBITDA in 
                                 FY2010), Los Angeles, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami. Its 
                                 distribution centers carry up to 11,500 specialty and broadline SKUs  50% of which are 
                                 imported.  

                                         Specialty SKUs represent the majority of all SKUs offered to its customers. Examples 
                                           include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, hormone-free 
                                           protein, truffles, caviar, and chocolate.  Chefs Warehouse competes on these SKUs 
                                           with regional, specialty distributors. 

                                         Broadline SKUs consist of more commoditized products such as cooking oils, butter, 
                                           eggs, milk, and flour. Chefs Warehouse competes on these products with other 
                                           broadline foodservice distributors such as Sysco, U.S. Foodservice, and Performance 
                                           Food Group. 

                                 Independent restaurants account for approximately 65.5% of sales, followed by hotels and 
                                 casinos at 8.6% of sales.

                                 In 2010, we estimate dairy accounted for approximately 24.5% of sales, followed by meat, 
                                 seafood, and charcuterie at 18.1%. The company  s penetration in cut protein and produce is 
                                 currently very limited but represents an opportunity  once the larger facility in the Bronx comes 
                                 on line. Private label accounts for 15% of sales  although penetration in private label is much 
                                 higher in dairy and butter.

                                 Our Thesis  

                                 We are initiating coverage on Chefs Warehouse with an  OUTPERFORM      rating and a $16 price 
                                 target. Our rating and price target are based on our belief that Chefs Warehouse should trade at 
                                 a premium to Sysco given the stronger top-line growth, but at a discount to United Natural 
                                 Foods given the lack of visibility on the top line, as well as the lack of geographic 
                                 diversification. We like the story for several reasons: 1) the industry is extremely fragmented 
                                 and Chefs Warehouse is well positioned to play a dominant role in industry consolidation; 
                                 2) Chefs Warehouse has significant opportunity to expand in existing markets with very little 
                                 capital investment required; 3) ROIC is high at 24.3%  and will likely increase as capacity 
                                 utilization outside of the Bronx increases; 4) the stock has significantly underperformed its 
                                 peers and the S&P since the IPO; and 5) free cash flow yield - at ~8% by FY13 (but lower in 
                                 2012 owing to the Bronx relocation)  will be allocated to acquisitions as well as debt 
                                 reduction. CHEF is trading at a FY12 (ending  December 2012) EV/EBITDA of 8.1x  an 11% 
                                 premium to SYY and a 13% discount to UNFI  and FY12 P/E of 13.7x.    

                                 Valuation 

                                 We limited our valuation comparisons to Sysco and United Natural Foods. As of closing prices 
                                 on September 2, 2011, CHEF was trading at an 11% premium to SYYs EV/EBITDA 
                                 valuation, and a 13% discount to UNFIs EV/EBITDA valuation. For all three companies, we 
                                 are using calendar 2012 EBITDA and EPS estimates. At our $16 price target  we value CHEF 
                                 at a FY12 EV/EBITDA of 9.4x and a P/E of 16.2x.  SYY is currently trading at a calendar 2012 
                                 EV/EBITDA of 7.3x and a P/E of 12.8x. UNFI  at  our $41 price target  is valued at a FY12 
                                 EV/EBITDA of 10.4x and P/E of 21.1x. In addition , since July 28, 2011  CHEFs first day of 
                                 trading  the stock has significantly underperformed SYY, UNFI and the S&P500  giving 
                                 further credence to our OUTPERFORM    rating. Please refer to Exhibit 6 for relative performance 
                                 measures.

                                      Premium to Sysco, Discount to United Natural Foods 

                                      Exhibit 8 highlights how Chefs Warehouse compares to both Sysco and United Natural Foods 
                                      on a range of metrics we view as relevant. The companys top line is clearly superior to Sysco's 
                                       but lack of visibility on the top line, as well as an overwhelming geographic exposure to the 
                                      New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut markets pose some risk. In total, Chefs Warehouse 
                                      ranks favorably to Sysco on four metrics, similarly on six metrics, and worse on two metrics. 
                                      Compared to United Natural Foods, Chefs Warehouse ranks favorably on three metrics, 
                                      similarly on six, and worse on four. Clearly some of these rankings are subjective  so our 
                                      comments explain the thought process behind our rankings. In conclusion, we believe that our 
                                      rating and price target accurately reflect these rankings.

                                     Market Analysis Supports our Potential Revenue Estimates  

                                     Given our estimates for total sales potential in existing markets, we decided to analyze 
                                     each market using population and income levels to see if, in fact, our estimates for Chefs' 
                                     Warehouse revenue potential were realistic. We use the New York market as a 
                                     benchmark for this analysis.      By our estimate, the broader New York market has a population 
                                     of 4.29 million people earning in excess of $150,000 in annual income. We assume this is the 
                                     target market for the fancy and family dini      ng crowd, although we acknowledge we are 
                                     probably underestimating the size of the mark         et. Our analysis tells us Chefs' Warehouse 
                                     revenues in the New York market will reach $60.30 per person ($259 million total sales in the 
                                     tri-state area) in 2011 for the >$150,000 population.

                                        Using this base revenue per person in the >$150,000 income demographic, we looked at Chefs' 
                                        Warehouse five remaining markets to determine sales potential assuming similar levels of 
                                        penetration. For population, we use both U.S. Census and Metro Market Studies data. Our 
                                        findings are summarized in Exhibit 13. We estimate total dollar sales could reach $516 million 
                                        (versus estimated capacity of $321 million). Our $516 million estimate is also very conservative 
                                        because population estimates for vacation destinations (e.g., Las Vegas and Miami) consider 
                                        only full-time residents, and so are significantly understated.

                                            As detailed in Exhibit 14  if the remaining five   facilities reached the productivity of the New 
                                            York facility, sales could reach $321 million  reasonable in our view because we estimate the 
                                            market is at least $516 million, and we know we are significantly understating the size of the 
                                            Las Vegas and Miami markets.

                                      New Market Revenue Potential Is at Least $270 Million 

                                      The methodology for our analysis of sales potential for new markets is similar to our analysis of 
                                      existing markets. We identified Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Houston as markets with 
                                      sufficient concentration of the  menu-driven restaurants that ar e needed to support a market-
                                      entry. We use the same $60.30 per person with incomes over $150,000 in each market. Based 
                                      on this analysis, new markets could add an incremental $270 million in revenues.

                                      Assuming similar levels of productivity as at the New York facility, we estimate the company 
                                      would need to expand distribution center square footage by 184,000 to meet the $270 million 
                                      sales potential. Exhibit 16 on the next page summarizes our analysis.

                                       Historical Success With Acquisitions Gives Us Confidence 
                                       Chefs Warehouse Can Expand Successfully in New Markets  

                                       A key component of the companys growth strategy has been and likely will continue to be the 
                                       pursuit of select acquisitions, and the companys   integration track record gives us confidence 
                                       the company can execute on additional acquisitions. The company entered the Washington 
                                       D.C., San Francisco, and Miami markets through acquisitions, and in June 2011, Chefs' 
                                       Warehouse completed a tuck-in acquisition of one of its smaller competitors in the New York 
                                       market. The companys superior technology pr              ovides Chefs Wareho  use with a critical 
                                       competitive advantage  facilitating seamless and immediate integration  usually within 24-48 
                                       hours of finalizing a transaction. Please see Exhibit 17 for a list of recent acquisitions and our

                                       The foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating, which should provide 
                                       Chefs' Warehouse with plenty of potential acquisition opportunities. Key markets that come to 
                                       mind include Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Criteria for new markets versus tuck-in 
                                       acquisitions vary slightly and are detailed in Exhibit 18.

                                  To some extent, the companys ability to make accretive acquisitions will be a function of 
                                  acquisition multiples. Prior acquisitions have   been extremely accretive  in part because 
                                  acquisition multiples have been well below where CHEF is currently trading (1x) as a multiple 
                                  of sales. We caution that CHEFs IPO provid     es sellers with some ammunition on where a 
                                  specialty distributor should be valued  making future negotiations potentially a little more 
                                  contentious.   

                                  Organic Growth Not Immune to Economic Slowdown 
                                  While we believe the current environment is unlikely to deteriorate by the same order of 
                                  magnitude as the deterioration seen in 4Q08 through 3Q09, we do believe Chefs' Warehouse 
                                  exposure to the tri-state area poses some risk. On  the most recent conference call, the company 
                                  indicated organic sales remained unchanged from the 13% run rate seen in 2Q11. However, 
                                  1) inflation/mix decelerated from 4.9% in 1Q11 to 3.3% in 2Q11  while inflation remained 
                                  unchanged  so the deceleration was entirely du   e to a decline in mix; and 2) the company 
                                  experienced significant sales declines beginning in 4Q08 through 3Q09, coinciding with the 
                                  deteriorating economic environment. Today, the high-end customer appears more or less 
                                  unaffected, but if the current environment persists, it seems unlikely that Chefs Warehouse will 
                                  be unaffected.  

                                  Exhibit 19 below details the companys organic and total sales growth rates from 1Q08-2Q11. 
                                  Beginning in 4Q08, organic sales deteriorated significantly and remained negative for four 
                                  consecutive quarters. Today, we believe Chefs Warehouse has significantly upgraded systems 
                                  and technology to more rapidly identify changes in their customers ordering patterns, so we 
                                  believe a slowdown of the same 2008/2009 magnitude is unlikely, but caution that organic sales 
                                  could still slow slightly given the current uncertainty in the environment.

                                 Chefs Warehouse in More Detail                    

                                 A long history of serving the New York market and a gradual, national expansion though 
                                 select and accretive acquisitions culminated with the successful July 27, 2011 IPO    .     In 
                                 1985, Chefs Warehouse (formerly known as Dairyland USA) was founded as a niche, specialty 
                                 food provider to chefs in the New York metropolitan area. Since then, the company has grown 
                                 to have a presence in six different markets. The company has completed multiple acquisitions in 
                                 its history, with acquisitions in 1999 (Washington, D.C. market); 2005 (Los Angeles, San 
                                 Francisco, and Las Vegas markets); 2007-2009 (San Francisco and Washington, D.C. markets); 
                                 2010 (Miami market); and 2011 (New York            market). The company entered into a 
                                 recapitalization transaction with BGCP  a private  equity sponsor  in 2005, and having exited 
                                 from private equity ownership in 2010, offered shares to the public in an IPO on July 27, 2011. 
                                 Today, the company is well positioned to cont inue to gain share in an extremely fragmented 
                                 market through its superior technology, strong balance sheet, broad geographic presence, and 
                                 superior salesforce.  

                                 State of the art technology consists of:  

                                     1)  A centralized ERP system (Oracle) for purchasing and financials. 

                                     2)  A centralized, proprietary AS400 order-entry system for sales. 

                                     3)  A new warehouse management system (BFC Dakota system), which was recently 
                                         implemented at its New York facility. Highlights of the system include voice-pick 
                                         technology, inbound scanning, and pallet and truck-building software. Chefs' 
                                         Warehouse is currently implementing the system at its Washington D.C. facility, and 
                                         management expects a company-wide rollout by 1Q12. 

                                     4)  Roadnet logistics, a routing application used to dynamically route all trucks. 

                                     5)  Geotab, an onboard GPS and truck diagnostic tool that assesses the vehicles health and 
                                         idle time, and the general performance of the drivers.  

                                 Geographic footprint provides competitive advantage.      With a presence in New York, Los 
                                 Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, Chefs Warehouse is the    
                                 only specialty foodservice distributor with a presence in multiple geographies and we believe 
                                 this provides the company with a competitive advantage with better service levels, order 
                                 accuracy, and more efficient routing, resulting in reduced inbound and outbound freight costs.  

                                 Chefs' Warehouse is uniquely positioned to serve the early adopters of culinary trends  .      
                                 As a distributor to cutting edge and fine-dining restaurants in the countrys leading culinary 
                                 markets, Chefs' Warehouse is focused on sourcing unique, specialty products before they 
                                 become mainstream culinary ingredients. As a result, the company has an unparalleled breadth 
                                 and depth of specialty product offerings (e.g., Chefs' Warehouse offers more than 125 varieties 
                                 of olive oil vs. a typical broadline distributor carrying only 5-10 different types of olive oil). 
                                 The companys portfolio includes ~11,500 SKUs  available to order, and 7,000 SKUs that are 
                                 in-stock every day  a significantly broader offering than many of the smaller, private specialty 
                                 distributors. The SKU offering will likely expand once the company moves into its new facility

BMO Capital Markets                                                                                       Chefs' Warehouse 
                                  
                                 in the Bronx. New opportunities for SKU expansion include cut proteins, produce, and an 
                                 expanded frozen offering.  

                                 National presence and breadth of SKUs means Chefs Warehouse is a critical route-to-
                                 market for specialty suppliers .  Chefs' Warehouse sources product from more than 1,000 
                                 different suppliers, none of which accounts for more than 5% of Chefs' Warehouses total 
                                 purchases in a year. In some cases, Chefs' Wa  rehouse provides a critical route-to-market for 
                                 some of the smaller suppliers, and as a result,  we believe Chefs' Warehouse is well positioned 
                                 to obtain favorable terms with these suppliers. In some instances, Chefs' Warehouse is also able 
                                 to lock-up exclusivity on some items from Italy, Spain, France and other Mediterranean 
                                 countries  although Chefs' Warehouse generally remains committed to meeting the needs of 
                                 the customer  so exclusivity arrangements would be arranged only if there were demand from 
                                 the end-use customer.  

                                 The salesforce at Chefs' Warehouse (130-plus personnel) distinguishes itself from its 
                                 competitors through its knowledge base and quality of service.         The majority of sales 
                                 professionals have some sort of a culinary background, either formal culinary training, degrees 
                                 in culinary arts, or prior experience in the industry. In general, each salesperson is responsible 
                                 for 50 customers, to maintain high levels of cu stomer service, as evid enced in Exhibit 7 (page 
                                 5) comparing revenue per salesperson at Sysco, United Natural Foods, and Chefs Warehouse. 
                                 Salespeople are compensated on both commission and gross profit dollars.  

                                 Financial Forecasts 

                                 In 3Q11, we are looking for EPS of $0.19 and EBITDA of $7.5 million.    Our estimate assumes 
                                 total sales increase 13.5% to $96.4 million, with gross margins declining 75bp to 25.2%. We 
                                 forecast operating expenses (exclu ding D&A) grow 9.1% to $16.8 million, a 70 bp year-over-
                                 year improvement in margin  leading to a 20 bp deterioration in operating margins to 7.2%, or 
                                 $6.9 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $7.5 million, a 5 bp deterioration in margin to 7.8%. 
                                 We assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate, and 21.1 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.19.  

                                 In FY2011, our estimates for EPS and EBITDA are $0.77 and $29.7 million, respectively. 
                                 Our estimate assumes total sales increase 18.3% to $390.7 million, with gross margins 
                                 improving 2 bp to 26.0%. We forecast operatin  g expenses (excluding  D&A) grow 15.9% to 
                                 $72.0 million, a 39 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 49 bp improvement 
                                 in operating margins to 7.0%, or $27.4 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $29.7 million, a 42 
                                 bp improvement in margin to 7.6%. We assume interest expense of $1.2 million, a 39.1% tax 
                                 rate and 20.9 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.77.  

                                 In FY2012, we are looking for EPS of $0.99 and EBITDA of $37.7 million.         Our estimate 
                                 assumes total sales increase 12.5% to $431.2 million, with gross margins expanding 30 bp to 
                                 26.3%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 5.3% to $75.8 million, an 85 bp 
                                 year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 115 bp improvement in the operating 
                                 margin, to 8.2%, or $35.2 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $37.7 million, a 115 bp

BMO Capital Markets                                                                                       Chefs' Warehouse 
                                  
                                 improvement in margin, to 8.7%. We assume interest expense of $0.9 million, a 39.5% tax rate 
                                 and 21.0 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.99.  

                                 Chefs' Warehouse reported a 2Q11 EPS of $0.17, or $0.20 when using pro forma interest 
                                 expense and a normalized tax rate. Adjusted        EBITDA came in at $7.6 million.       Our 
                                 EBITDA subtracts expenses associated with pu blic company costs, and stock compensation, 
                                 and excludes the benefit of the workers co  mpensation settlement  and customs duty refund.  
                                 Total sales increased 18.7% to $99.3 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.0% to the top line and 
                                 inflation/mix contributed 3.3%, and the remaining growth was organic. Gross margins 
                                 increased 21 bp to 26.5%. Operating expenses  (excluding D&A) grew 19.3% to $18.7 million 
                                 after excluding incremental public company costs ($0.3 million), one-time stock compensation 
                                 costs ($0.12 million), one-time workers compensation trust settlement costs ($0.13 million), and 
                                 a one-time benefit from a customs duty refund ($ 0.2 million). Operating margins increased 31 
                                 bp to 7.3%. Interest expense came in at $3.3 million, but does not reflect the post-IPO capital 
                                 structure, so we used a pro forma interest expense of $0.4 million. We used a normalized tax 
                                 rate of 39.6%, which gets us to EPS of $0.20.

                                               Executive Summary 

                                               The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.  (“Chefs’”)  is  one  of  the  largest  specialty  food 
                                               distributors    in    the    U.S.,    largely  serving  upscale    independent    menu 
                                               restaurants, fine hotels and clubs. The company offers  over 11,500 unique items 
                                               many of which are premium products. From hard to get olive oil from Italy to unique 
                                               cheese from France, the company caters to and is counted on by the most discerning 
                                               chefs. Founded in 1985, with its origins as a dairy distributor in the New York City metro 
                                               market, Chefs’ currently operates in six major markets, including New York, Los Angeles, 
                                               San   Francisco,   Las   Vegas,   Washington   D.C.   and   Miami,   but   also   services   Boston, 
                                               Philadelphia and Napa Valley. 

                                               We are initiating coverage on The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF) with a Buy 
                                               rating and a 12-month price target of $17.50. Significant opportunity exists for 
                                               Chefs’ to drive higher sale/earnings as it flexes its technology platform, the benefits of 
                                               which remain in very early innings, and combines this with its superior product offering, 
                                               unique  sales  force,  and  limited  buyer  and  supplier  power.  Further,  we  believe  the 
                                               company will work to consolidate this fragmented industry, potentially transforming a 
                                               cottage industry into its own estate. 

                                               The application of technology should drive growth and lower costs. Indeed, as 
                                               Chefs’ Warehouse applies best practices and leverages the benefits of its sales, warehouse 
                                               and distribution technology systems, the company should be able to drive better organic 
                                               growth and lower costs. The company’s CRM and price optimization technology should 
                                               help Chefs’ increase placements/customer and new customers, while also allowing Chefs’ 
                                               to better manage gross profit/customer. This, combined with the completion of the full 
                                               rollout of its warehouse management system by 1Q12, should help reduce costs and lead 
                                               to improved margins and earnings, especially in regions outside of New York. Every 1% in 
                                               sales growth adds just under ½ penny in EPS per quarter, while every 10 bps in better 
                                               margin adds roughly $0.01 annually, according to our estimates. 

                                               There  is  ample  opportunity  for  accretive,  tuck-in,  acquisitions.  Given  the 
                                               fragmentation of Chefs’ industry sub-sector, one that is largely dominated by a myriad of 
                                               less sophisticated, regional or mom and pop operators, there exist significant prospects to 
                                               expand  Chefs’  distribution  reach  through  acquisition.  Many  of  these  transactions  are 
                                               largely purchases of customer lists, lowering integration risk, while providing increased 
                                               share in its current markets as well as expansion in new geographies. We expect that most 
                                               of these purchases will be relatively small, $10-$30 million in revenues, and be nicely 
                                               accretive as they should be done at 2-4x EBITDA. 

                                               Limited  industry  buyer  and  supplier  power,  coupled  with  Chefs’  superior 
                                               product   offering   and   uniquely   positioned   sales   force   should   allow   the 
                                               company   to   capture   excess   profits.  Unlike  certain  other   segments   of   food 
                                               distribution, Chefs’ faces limited buyer or supplier power risk, as its top ten customers 
                                               account for under 10% of net revenue and no supplier accounts for more than 5% of its 
                                               products.  In addition,  Chefs’  also  carries over 11,500 SKUs, an amount roughly 7x  its 
                                               typical competitor and provides a much broader range of specialty products, while also 
                                               offering  many  everyday  staple  items  (flour,  sugar,  butter)  as  well.  Finally,  Chefs’  125 
                                               person sales force is uniquely positioned, as most are culinary educated or have spent

     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                               Chefs’,  we  believe,  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  invest  in  the  faster-
                                               growth,  high-end  consumer  segment  in  the  food-away-from-home  channel 
                                               that is driven by the wealthy and educated consumer. Indeed, as exhibited nicely 
                                               by Whole Foods (WFM, $63.11, Hold), United Natural Foods (UNFI, $38.27, Hold) and 
                                               The Fresh Market (TFM, $36.21, NC), among others, the high-end consumer segment has 
                                               exhibited very strong growth coming out of the 2008 downturn and continues to show 
                                               resilience.  With  a  correlation  of  0.80  between  Chefs’  organic  growth  and  household 
                                               wealth, similar to the correlation exhibited by Whole Foods according to our calculations, 
                                               Chefs’  customers  clearly cater  to  the higher-end  demographic and,  as a result,  recent 
                                               stock market gyrations are a concern. However, our research has shown little slowdown 
                                               in trends, although we have built much lower organic growth into our model in the back 
                                               half of 2011. If this does not materialize, EPS could exceed our current estimate with every 
                                               1%  in  sales  equal  to  just  under  ½  penny  in  earnings  per  quarter,  according  to  our 
                                               estimates. 

                                               Valuation 

                                               Our  price target of $17.50 is 18.3x our  FY12 EPS estimate of $0.96.  This  is 
                                               below  United  Natural  Foods’  multiple  of  19.0x  and  above  Sysco’s  of  12.7x.  Sysco, 
                                               however, is a much slower growing company than both UNFI and Chefs’. We also believe 
                                               Whole Foods and The Fresh Market are tangential comps, and Chefs’ valuation is nicely 
                                               under these companies as well. Our DCF places the value of the company at about $20. 

                                               Risks 

                                               Near-term: economic downturn resulting in meaningful contraction in wealth, 
                                               acquisition-related integration or technology/systems implementation and geographic 
                                               concentration risk. Longer-term: Group purchasing organizations.

                                               Company Snapshot 

                                               The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.  (“Chefs’”)  is  one  of  the  largest  specialty  food 
                                               distributors    in    the    U.S.,    largely    serving    upscale    independent    menu 
                                               restaurants, fine hotels and clubs. The company offers  over 11,500 unique items 
                                               many of which are premium products. From hard to get olive oil from Italy to unique 
                                               cheese from France, the company caters to and is counted on by the most discerning 
                                               chefs. Founded in 1985, with its origins as a dairy distributor in the New York City metro 
                                               market, Chefs currently operates in six major markets, including New York, Los Angeles, 
                                               San   Francisco,   Las   Vegas,   Washington   D.C.   and   Miami,   but   also   services   Boston, 
                                               Philadelphia and Napa Valley.

                                               New York is the company’s largest  and most important  market.  Indeed, this 
                                               market, which is heavily concentrated in the New York City metro area, but extends from 
                                               Atlantic City to Boston is the largest for Chefs’, generating approximately 65% of FY10 net 
                                               revenue. In addition, we believe that the company’s operating margins in this region are 
                                               quite  a  bit  higher,  roughly  double  the  operating  margins  in  its  other  regions,  with 
                                               opportunity for even further improvement  over time, we estimate.  The higher margin 
                                               profile doesn’t come as much of a surprise to us given New York is the company’s longest 
                                               standing market, it drives the most revenue, it contains the company’s largest and most 
                                               efficient distribution center and New York metro provides for a very unique concentration 
                                               of customers relative to other U.S. geographies. We believe over time that margins in the 
                                               company’s other regions will improve quite nicely as Chefs’ looks to replicate its model in 
                                               New York, with those markets that have the best densities and lower relative stem miles 
                                               likely able to benefit the most, in our opinion.

                                              Opportunity  in  New  York  market  centred  on  increasing  placements  per 
                                              customer.  According  to  filings,  Chefs’  believes  the  company  distributes  at  least  one 
                                              product per week to roughly 60% of the addressable New York metro market, relative to 
                                              the 20-30% in its other regions currently, with the addressable market constituting those 
                                              independent restaurants with an average price for an entrée of above $15. We do note 
                                              however,  this  is  not  market  share,  but  rather  suggestive  of  the  number  of  unique 
                                              customers to which Chefs’  distributes at least one product,  with restaurants buying a 
                                              myriad of products across food and non-food categories weekly. That said, we believe 
                                              growth in the New York metro market will come more from increased placements per 
                                              customer than new customers  (although plenty of opportunity remains here  as well), 
                                              while growth in Chefs’ other geographies (as well as future markets) should see the scale 
                                              weighed more towards new customers than higher placements in the beginning.

                                                Since its founding in 1985, Chefs’ has grown to become the largest operator 
                                                in the specialty foodservice distribution sub-segment, catering specifically to

                                               Overview  of  Pro  Forma  FY11  Adjustments.  We  have  utilized  pro  forma  FY11 
                                               estimates in an effort to better illustrate a normalized operating year for Chefs’ given the

                                               January 1, 2011. Above the line, revenue and gross profit are unchanged from our non-
                                               pro  forma  estimates.  As  it  relates  to  operating  expenses,  we  have  assumed  higher 
                                               operating expenses associated with being a public company, as well as the removal of the 
                                               stock compensation expense related to the 50% up front vest in 3Q, replaced with a more 
                                               normalized stock compensation expense rate for the whole year. Below the line, the pro 
                                               forma estimates reflect the post IPO capital structure and lower interest expense, as well

                                               financing  fee amortization  going  forward.  The pro  forma  estimates  also  incorporate a 
                                               higher corporate tax rate and pro forma share count to reflect the company’s initial public

                                               3Q11 Pro Forma Expectations – EPS of $0.18, EBITDA of $7.1mm (ex. one-
                                               time items) 
                                                

                                               Total Revenue Growth of 14.3%. We have assumed total organic growth of 7.5%, 
                                               including higher placements/customer and new customers along with contribution from 
                                               mix and higher inflation. Our organic revenue assumptions do incorporate some slowing 
                                               of  organic  growth  given  more  difficult  compares  and  the  potential  for  some  macro 
                                               pressures,  although  continued  trends  similar  to  those  in  1Q  and  2Q  would  present 
                                               opportunity  for  upside.  In  addition,  we  have  assumed  6.8%  growth  from  acquisition 
                                               given the contribution from Harry Wils which closed at the end of 2Q. 

                                               Gross Margin of 26.0% – flat from the prior year period. We have assumed flat 
                                               gross margin improvement as mix and slower inflation pass through could  hold back 
                                               gross margin growth. 

                                               Operating  Expenses  (As  %  of  Net  revenues)  of  19.1%.  Given  the  lack  of  a 
                                               comparable  pro  forma  operating  expense  in  the  prior  year  period,  the  y/y  change  in 
                                               operating expense as a % of sales is not comparable. On a GAAP basis, we assume 205 
                                               bps expense deleverage largely to account for the one-time stock compensation expense 
                                               of approximately $1.6mm associated with the 50% upfront vesting in conjunction with 
                                               the company’s IPO, as well as some carry through of expenses related to Harry Wils. Our 
                                               3Q11 Pro forma operating expense margin of 19.1% reflects the removal of the upfront 
                                               stock  compensation  expense  and  is  replaced  with  a  more  normalized  estimate  for 
                                               quarterly stock compensation. 

                                               Below the Line – Net interest expense of $0.4mm, tax rate of 39.0% and share count of 
                                               20.8mm shares. 

                                               Potential  Hurricane  Impact:  While  it  is  unclear  what  the  impact  could  be  from 
                                               Hurricane Irene on earnings, we do see the potential for $0.01-$0.03 negative drag on EPS in 
                                               3Q11.  That  said,  we  have  left  our  3Q  forecast  unchanged  given  the  treatment  of  any 
                                               potential hurricane-related costs as one-time.

                                              Additional Information – Net interest expense in 3Q adjusts for one-time items related 
                                              to the company’s IPO and refinancing, including the removal of deferred financing fee 
                                              amortization, original issue discount and call premium associated with the pre-IPO capital 
                                              structure. On August 2, 2011, The Chefs’ Warehouse completed its Initial Public Offering, 
                                              offering 4,666,667 primary shares and 5,683,333 secondary shares, including an over-
                                              allotment  of  1,350,000  shares,  at  an  offering  price  of  $15.  The  net  proceeds  to  the 
                                              company of approximately $63.1mm will be used to pay down existing debt. Jefferies & 
                                              Company, Inc. acted as a Joint Bookrunner on the IPO. 

                                               

                                              FY11 Pro Forma Expectations – EPS of $0.77, EBITDA of $29.3mm (ex. one-
                                              time items) 
                                               

                                              Total Revenue Growth of 18.5%. We have assumed total organic growth of 11.2%. 
                                              This is driven by strong growth in placements per customer and new customers, coupled 
                                              with contribution from inflation and mix. We have also assumed acquisition growth of 
                                              4.8% for the year, which incorporates the contribution from Harry Wils in the back-half of 
                                              the year and contribution from the company’s Miami acquisition in 1H:11. The remaining 
                                              difference is attributed to the benefit of the extra selling week in FY11, which we estimate 
                                              improves FY11 revenue growth by 2.4%. 

                                              Gross Margin of 26.2% –  up 22 bps from FY10 Pro Forma. We have assumed 
                                              some gross margin expansion in FY11 as the company laps the 32 bps of contraction last 
                                              year  (non  pro  forma  basis)  on  improved  product  mix  y/y,  offset  by  the  elevated 
                                              inflationary climate and potential for some slower inflation pass through during 2H:11. 

                                              Operating Expenses (As % of Net revenues) of 19.1% – down 119 bps from 
                                              FY10 Pro Forma. On a pro forma basis we have assumed nice operating leverage as the 
                                              company  benefits  from  higher  sales  and  continued  cost  control  as  well  as  improved 
                                              leverage during 4Q given the extra week. 

                                              Below the Line – Net interest expense of $1.7mm, tax rate of 39.1% and share count of 
                                              20.8mm shares. 

                                               

                                              FY12 Expectations – EPS of $0.96, EBITDA of $36.2mm 
                                               

                                              Total Revenue Growth of 11.6%. We have assumed organic growth of 10.5%, plus 
                                              3.3% contribution from Harry Wils in the first half of the year. Our revenue forecast model 
                                              does not assume any additional revenue contribution from acquisitions. FY12 is also a 52 
                                              week year, resulting in an estimated -2.1% impact y/y relative to last year’s 53 week year. 

                                              Gross Margin of 26.3% –  up 10 bps from FY11 Pro Forma. We have assumed 
                                              minimal gross margin expansion in FY12 and beyond mostly due to some benefits from 
                                              mix and improved customer account management. 

                                              Operating Expenses (As % of  Net revenues) of  18.4%  –  down  70  bps from 
                                              FY11 Pro Forma. We have assumed solid operating expense leverage as the company 
                                              benefits from the full rollout of its warehouse management systems by the end of 1Q12, 
                                              as well as continued expense control on higher revenues. FY12 will also include a full year 
                                              of normalized stock compensation and public company expenses. 

                                              Below the Line – Net interest expense of $1.7mm, tax rate of 39.0% and share count of 
                                              20.9mm shares.

                                               Turning a Cottage Into an Estate 

                                               Leveraging Technology to Drive Performance 

                                               The application of technology should drive growth and lower costs. Indeed, as 
                                               Chefs’ Warehouse applies best practices and leverages the benefits of its sales, warehouse 
                                               and distribution technology systems, the company should be able to drive better organic 
                                               growth rates and lower costs. This should allow the company to improve its operating 
                                               margins not only in New York, where they are much higher, but also quite nicely in other 
                                               regions as the company looks to replicate its New York model in its other geographies. 
                                               The company’s move to focus heavily on incorporating technology and best practices 
                                               across its business we believe will continue to place further distance between Chefs’ and 
                                               its competitors, who are typically far less sophisticated given the highly fragmented, and 
                                               still very cottage nature of this sub-sector of foodservice distribution. Indeed, our research 
                                               suggests  that  while  other  regional  or  local  competitors  similar  to  Chefs’  may  capture 
                                               higher  gross  margin  in  certain  instances,  Chefs’  is  nevertheless  able  to  deliver  higher 
                                               operating margins given the lower cost to distribute. This is due in part to the company’s 
                                               technology driven efficiencies and practices (the other reason we believe is the lack of 
                                               buyer and supplier power). 

                                               Starting early should be one key to success. Chefs’ has made a concerted effort to 
                                               integrate technology into its business before it speeds up its efforts to consolidate the 
                                               industry,  which  we  believe  should  mitigate  potential  issues  down  the  road  as  Chefs’ 
                                               grows,  while  also  better  positioning  the  company  to  potentially  deliver  and  capture 
                                               improved results over time sooner than perhaps would have been achieved otherwise. 
                                               UNFI, Chefs’ closest public comparable in our opinion, but not a direct competitor, has 
                                               struggled over time with its own technology implementation as the company worked to 
                                               consolidate the industry first and largely implemented technology second. This, coupled 
                                               with the significant growth in the natural and organic industry over the years, has limited 
                                               UNFI’s ability to implement certain technology into its DCs, however this is changing with 
                                               CEO Steve Spinner. While UNFI was able to get the right systems into its new Lancaster, 
                                               TX distribution center late last year, a win on many fronts, UNFI did run into some issues 
                                               with the implementation, which resulted in higher costs and slowed the initial timeline of 
                                               the full rollout to its other DCs. With Chefs’ putting all its technology systems into its 
                                               biggest and busiest facility in NY, we do not believe it will suffer the same fate as UNFI 
                                               (don’t feel too sorry for UNFI, the stock has done just fine!) 

                                               Higher  organic  revenue  and  improved  gross  margin  are  possible  as  the 
                                               company applies technology and best practices to its sales efforts. The benefits 
                                               of applying technology to supercharge Chefs’ selling efforts remain in very early innings, 
                                               we believe, and have the potential to drive higher organic sales as well as improve gross 
                                               margin over the medium and long-term. Indeed, the application of the company’s CRM 
                                               and price optimization technology systems should help Chefs’ increase both the number 
                                               of placements it sells per customer and the number of new customers, while also aiding 
                                               the sales force to better manage account profitability. Chefs’ has also worked to better-
                                               align  its  sales  force  with  its  internal  goals  and  we  believe  the  company’s  constantly 
                                               improving platforms should better provide the sales force the tools it needs. Interestingly, 
                                               similar to the time when the company began to implement early variations of its sales IT 
                                               platforms and systems in 2009, Chefs’  began to see nice improvements in its organic 
                                               growth rates, a welcome sign that the  current application of much improved systems 
                                               could boost results even further.

     CHEF
                                                
     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                               The  company  is  also  focused  on  using  technology  and  enhanced  process 
                                               standards  to  help  lower  costs  and  drive  productivity  improvements  in  its 
                                               warehouse and distribution functions. To that end, Chefs’ put in place a warehouse 
                                               management system, Road Net and pick-to-voice technologies into its largest DC in the 
                                               Bronx. While Chefs’ plans to roll-out the warehouse management system to its other DCs 
                                               by  1Q12, it has wisely  already  implemented and tested the systems in its largest and 
                                               busiest distribution center in New York. Next year the company will be moving its current 
                                               Bronx facility to a larger location  in close proximity.  This process could  end up  being 
                                               relatively seamless, although there is the potential for some initial lag in productivity as 
                                               the employees get used to the ins and outs of the new facility. On the distribution side, 
                                               the company is also working on a number of tools to enhance route efficiency. 

                                               Successful  execution  and  leverage  of  its  technology  systems  and  processes 
                                               should  drive  higher  operating  margins,  especially  in  areas  outside  NY  as 
                                               Chefs’ looks to replicate its New York model. Margins in the company’s New York 
                                               market are quite a bit higher than its other regions, roughly double we estimate, largely 
                                               due to efficiency the company has driven into its business in the tri-state area. In addition, 
                                               the  company’s  New  York  market  is  the  longest  standing  for  Chefs’  and  contains  the 
                                               largest and most efficient distribution facility, with the market contributing roughly 65% 
                                               of FY10 consolidated net revenue. Despite the company’s long-standing strength in New 
                                               York, we believe there remains ample runway to improve margins, as higher placements 
                                               per  customer  and  new  customers  are  supported  by  the  efficiencies  gained  from  the 
                                               warehouse management system in its Bronx DC. Clearly, the densities in New York City 
                                               metro and the shorter relative stem miles are also a big help to margins. 

                                               Replicating New York elsewhere should be quite fruitful. Beyond New York, the 
                                               company has significant opportunity to improve the margin profile of its other regions, as 
                                               Chefs’  looks  to  replicate  its  New  York  model including  the  implementation  of  its 
                                               warehouse management system  across its other DCs by 1Q12  and the addition of its 
                                               other CRM and price optimization technologies. Only a select grouping of MSAs in the 
                                               U.S., we believe, have characteristics similar enough to New York, including necessary 
                                               densities, to allow for the potential for similar margin structures to New York over the 
                                               long-term  in  those  markets.  The  company’s  San  Francisco  market  and  south  Florida 
                                               operations would likely fit that profile, as would Chicago, although this is a market in 
                                               which  Chefs’  does  not  currently  operate.  That  said,  margins  in  the  company’s  other 
                                               existing  markets, including  Washington DC, Los Angeles  and  Las Vegas,  also  have the 
                                               potential to move meaningfully higher over time, if the company executes well on its 
                                               strategy, helping the company’s overall margin profile. However, longer stem miles and 
                                               lower densities, are likely to keep the margin structure somewhat below that of New York.

                                                     Fruitful Acquisition Landscape 

                                                     There  is  ample  opportunity  for  accretive,  tuck-in,  acquisitions.  Given  the 
                                                     fragmentation of Chefs’ industry sub-sector, one that is largely dominated by a myriad of 
                                                     less sophisticated, regional or mom and pop operators, there exist significant prospects to 

                                                     expand  Chefs’  distribution  reach  through  acquisition.  Many  of  these  transactions  are 
                                                     largely purchases of customer lists, lowering integration risk, while providing increased 

                                                     share in its current markets as well as expansion in new geographies. We expect that most 
                                                     of these purchases will be relatively small, $10-$30 million in revenues, and be nicely 
                                                     accretive as they should be done at 2-4x EBITDA. 

                                                     The  number  of  acquisitions  done  per  year  is  likely  to  increase,  although 

                                                     future  acquisition  activity  is  not  in  our  numbers.  Indeed,  the  company  has 
                                                     acquired a number of smaller operators over the last few years, averaging approximately 

                                                     one transaction per year. We believe that the company is likely to step-up the number of 
                                                     acquisitions  it does on a yearly basis to  perhaps  2-3 transactions per year on average 
                                                     which we estimate could add a few hundred basis points of sales growth annually. In 

                                                     FY10, sales growth from acquisitions totalled approximately 3%, while we estimate that a 
                                                     half   year   contribution   from   the   company’s   June   2010   Miami   acquisition  and  the 
                                                     company’s  June  2011  acquisition  of  Harry  Wils  in  New  York  metro  should  add  a 

                                                     combined 4.8% to sales growth in FY11. In FY12 we have assumed 3.3% sales growth 
                                                     from acquisitions, representing the contribution in the first half of the year from Harry 

                                                     Wils.  We  estimate  total  revenue  contribution  for  Harry  Wils  of  approximately  $25mm 
                                                     annualized, after-taking a discount to our estimated sales of approximately $30mm, in-
                                                     line   with   the   company’s   acquisition   practices,   although   this   could  indeed  prove 

                                                     conservative    if    customer    retention    remains    high.  Outside    of    recently    acquired 
                                                     transactions, we do not model in any benefit from future transactions.

                                                     company’s   typical   transaction   involves  the   purchase   of   smaller,  regional   or   local

                                                     operators with an average cash outlay for Chefs’ over its last four transactions of just over 
                                                     $5mm, which also tend to be accretive. In addition, many of the acquisitions involve the 
                                                     purchase of customer lists, working capital and inventory, which significantly lowers the 

                                                     integration  risk  and  shortens  the  time  to  close.  Lastly,  the  company  remains  quite 
                                                     conservative in its forecasts for contribution from  acquisitions, and assumes a  sizeable 
                                                     discount to actual revenues, which we estimate is upwards of 20-30%, depending on the 

                                                     transaction. This is to account for the potential for any customer transition or leakage, 
                                                     although we believe this assumption ends up being conservative in the end. The purchase 

                                                     price in a typical transaction is  done between 2-4x EBITDA with cash on hand and/or 
                                                     debt, resulting in nice accretion.

     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                                 Establishing  an  initial  presence  in  a  new  geography  will  likely  come  from 
                                                 acquisition. While three of the company’s four most recent transactions helped to add 
                                                 customers to already existing markets, such as New York, San Francisco and Washington, 
                                                 DC, we expect Chefs’ to move into additional new geographies across the U.S. over time, 
                                                 with the focus on the major MSAs with the best densities and culinary characteristics. An 
                                                 example of a transaction which allowed Chefs’ to establish a new presence in a market 
                                                 was the company’s June 2010 acquisition of Culinaire Specialty Foods, Inc., giving Chefs’ 
                                                 the opportunity  to  go into  South  Florida  for  a  mere $3.7mm.  After  entering  the new 
                                                 market,  the  company  can  expand  distribution  through  new  customers  and  increased 
                                                 placements per existing customer, although on-boarding new customers will represent 
                                                 the bulk of growth for some time in new markets, we believe. In Miami, Chefs’ will also 
                                                 be moving its current operations to a new facility in 3Q of FY11.  

                                                 A Look at Population Densities in the U.S. 

                                                 Density  analysis  suggests   opportunity  for  margin  improvement  in  other 
                                                 markets. While it is clear that the densities in the New York MSA, being the highest in the 
                                                 country, help Chefs’ capture higher profitability in the region, there are also a number of 
                                                 markets which likely have sufficient density profiles to support higher margin structures. 
                                                 Miami,  Philadelphia,  Boston  and  San  Francisco  are  all  markets  in  which  Chefs’  has  a 
                                                 presence,  although  some  more  than  others  at  the  current  juncture.  Chicago,  which 
                                                 registers third on the list below, is a market in which Chefs’ does not currently operate, 
                                                 but has attractive density profiles as well.

                                                Chefs’ Model Positions It to Capture Excess Profits 

                                                Limited  industry  buyer  and  supplier  power,  coupled  with  Chefs’  superior 
                                                product   offering   and   uniquely   positioned   sales   force   should   allow   the 
                                                company   to   capture   excess   profits.  Unlike   certain   other   segments   of   food 
                                                distribution, Chefs’ faces limited buyer or supplier power risk, as its top ten customers 
                                                account for under 10% of net revenue and no supplier accounts for more than 5% of its 
                                                products. In addition, Chefs’ also carries over 11,500 SKUs, an amount roughly 7x its 
                                                typical competitor and provides a much broader range of specialty products, while also 
                                                offering  many  everyday  staple  items  (flour,  sugar,  butter)  as  well.  Finally,  Chefs’  125 
                                                person sales force is uniquely positioned, as most are culinary educated or  have spent 
                                                significant time in the culinary industry. 

                                                Limited buyer and supplier power position Chefs’ quite favorably as it looks 
                                                to   consolidate  the   fragmented   landscape   over   the   long-term.  The   highly 
                                                fragmented landscape of distributors, which is largely composed of a myriad of regional 
                                                and  local  specialty  operators  who  service  an  also  fragmented  independent  restaurant 
                                                industry in the U.S., provides a favorable backdrop for Chefs’, indeed. This is especially 
                                                true as the top 10 customers for Chefs’ account for under 10% of net revenue. Equally 
                                                important, is that Chefs’ is supplied by an also fragmented network of producers, over 
                                                1,000  according  to  the  company,  with  many  instances  in  which  Chefs’  is  the  largest 
                                                distributor of a manufacturer’s product(s). According to filings, no supplier accounts for 
                                                more than 5% of Chefs’ products distributed. Taken together, this advantage should pay 
                                                dividends  for  Chefs’  over  the  long-run,  as  limited  buyer  and  supplier  power  suggest 
                                                excess profitability in the industry should go to the consolidator, with the potential for 
                                                further flow through to the bottom line given Chefs’ technology driven efficiencies. We 
                                                believe this  is  one of  the reasons  Chefs’  garners  higher  profit  margins  than its  public 
                                                comparables, UNFI and Sysco (SYY, $27.16, NC). While UNFI has been a consolidator in 
                                                the natural and organic space, they, unlike Chefs’, do face some supplier power and even 
                                                larger buyer power, with Hain Celestial (HAIN, $30.37, Buy) representing roughly 7% of 
                                                total   purchases   and   Whole   Foods  representing  35%   of   UNFI’s   net   sales   in   FY10, 
                                                something which has a tendency to depress excess profitability. 

                                                Superior product offering will continue to be a key differentiator for Chefs’. 
                                                The company’s vast product offering, including a wide variety of specialty items from 
                                                across the globe, places Chefs’ in a category all its own, in our opinion, relative to its 
                                                typical  competition.  Indeed,  the  company  distributes  over  11,500  SKUs,  an  amount 
                                                which represents approximately 7x the average SKU count of other competing specialty 
                                                distributors. Over the long-term, Chefs’ growing offering should allow the company to 
                                                further meet the diverse and ever-changing needs and tastes of  its chef customers. In 
                                                addition, we believe the company’s ability to provide a wide variety of food categories, as 
                                                well as certain everyday staple items, in a cost efficient manner limits the opportunity for 
                                                other distributors to take share and in fact further strengthens Chefs’ positioning in the 
                                                industry. While a typical independent restaurant is likely to have a number of different 
                                                suppliers  based  on  its  needs,  as  Chefs’  continues  to  expand  its  product  offering,  the 
                                                potential   opportunity   exists   for   the   company   to   perhaps   displace  competitors  as 
                                                restaurants and other accounts look to consolidate supplier partners, a trend which we 
                                                have witnessed in other places across the food vertical chain.

     CHEF

                                               A differentiated sales force and Chefs’ ability to extend credit to its customers 
                                               provide a strong go-to-market advantage. Chefs’ sales force looks to be uniquely 
                                               positioned as most are culinary educated or have spent significant time in the culinary 
                                               industry.  We believe this is uniquely advantageous and allows the company to better 
                                               understand and meet the needs of its chef customers as they look to differentiate their 
                                               product offering. In addition, given the spot nature of the order volume based on the 
                                               customers’ needs, Chefs’ ability to extend credit to its customers and manage that well is 
                                               a necessity for its customers. It is also a limiting factor in the growth of group purchasing 
                                               organizations  into  the  independent  restaurant  industry,  the  biggest  long-term  risk  for 
                                               Chefs’  we believe, as  these organizations  typically do not extend credit  to customers. 
                                               Chefs’  write-off  ratio  over  the  last  few  years  has  averaged  roughly  32  bps,  as  the 
                                               company’s dedicated Credit and Collections Department manages it well depending on 
                                               the climate. 

                                               Much more complicated than meets the eye. Despite what  may appear to be a 
                                               relatively  simple  and  straightforward  distribution  model,  Chefs’  specialty  business  is 
                                               intensely more complicated than may outwardly appear, something we determined first 
                                               hand one night as we witnessed how a product goes from the shelf in the warehouse to 
                                               the truck and ultimately to the customer. Profit margins generally in the food distribution 
                                               business are thin as companies rely on solid sales leverage and cost efficiencies to turn a 
                                               good profit. While larger broadline foodservice operators and those bigger distributors in 
                                               the food-at-home channel have the ability to drive efficiencies through larger drop sizes 
                                               and item volumes, we were  struck by  the inherent complexity in  not only  building a 
                                               pallet through the piece-pick process, but ultimately breaking down a pallet on the truck 
                                               as it is distributed  to the different customers on the route. We believe  the company’s 
                                               ability to operate a complex specialty distribution business and generate industry leading 
                                               profitability provides a distinct competitive advantage for Chefs’ and a barrier to entry for 
                                               others.  Indeed, the company’s order to fill rate is over  99%, pretty astounding,  while 
                                               miss-picks are now well under 1%. 

                                               Chefs’ is led by a very strong management team with significant experience. 
                                               The  company  was  founded  and  built  from  the  ground  up  by  Christopher  Pappas, 
                                               Chairman and CEO, and John Pappas, Director and Vice Chairman. Over the last six years, 
                                               the company has made a significant push to invest in its business, including both people 
                                               and technology. This included the hiring of James Wagner in 2005, appointed to COO in 
                                               March 2011, the hiring of Kenneth Clark in 2007, appointed to CFO in March 2009 and 
                                               the hiring of Frank O’Dowd in 2007, the company’s CIO.  These additions have created, 
                                               in  our  opinion,  a  formidable  senior  team.  Indeed,  the  chemistry  that  has  developed 
                                               between Mr. Pappas the CEO and Mr. Wagner the COO, while somewhat intangible, is 
                                               also quite important as this company sets a path toward accelerating growth.

                                               A Way to Invest in the High-End Consumer 

                                               Chefs’,  we  believe,  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  invest  in  the  faster-
                                               growth,  high-end  consumer  segment  in  the  food-away-from-home  channel 
                                               that is driven by the wealthy and educated consumer. Indeed, as exhibited nicely 
                                               by Whole Foods, United Natural Foods, and The Fresh Market, among others, the high-
                                               end  consumer  segment  has  exhibited  very  strong  growth  coming  out  of  the  2008 
                                               downturn and continues to show resilience. With a correlation of 0.80 between Chefs’ 
                                               organic  growth  and  household  wealth,  similar  to  the  correlation  exhibited  by  Whole 
                                               Foods  according  to  our  calculations,  Chefs’  customers  clearly  cater  to  the  higher-end

                                               could exceed our current estimate with every 1% in sales equal to just under ½ penny in

                                               Chefs’ is simply stronger, more nimble and better positioned, we believe, to 
                                               consolidate its industry over the long-term. While a deterioration in the U.S. macro 
                                               picture,  leading  to  wealth  contraction  in  the  higher-end  demographic,  would  likely 
                                               impact Chefs’ to some degree, the company has made significant improvements on its 
                                               operations and practices across its sales, warehouse and distribution functions since the 
                                               last downturn a few years ago. Chefs’ has and continues to build upon best practices and 
                                               implemented large scale improvements to its technology infrastructure (the benefits of 
                                               which  remain  in  very  early  innings  we  believe)  in  an  effort  to  truly  supercharge  its 
                                               business. These actions have not only served to strengthen the company’s operations, but 
                                               have also provided the company increased up to the moment insight (and still improving) 
                                               into  the business  and  prepared  Chefs’  to  drive results  and  gain  share even  when  the

                                              Landscape 

                                              The U.S. food distribution landscape is vast and characterized by a wide range 
                                              of  operator-types  who  distribute  across  the  food-away-from-home  (chain 
                                              restaurants, hospitals, hotels, etc.) and food-at-home (supermarkets, grocery 
                                              retail,  etc.)  channels.  The  broader  food-away-from-home  channel  in  which  Chefs’ 
                                              operates  is  dominated  by  major,  national  broadline  distributors  such  as  Sysco,  U.S. 
                                              Foodservice and Performance Food Group, as well as a number of regional and smaller 
                                              operators. Operators such as Sysco and its two closest peers, distribute largely to chain 
                                              restaurants, participants in the hospitality industry (hotels, etc.) and other large healthcare 
                                              and educational institutions, among others. Chefs’ operates in a much smaller niche of 
                                              the  food-away-from-home distribution channel, focusing  specifically  on specialty items 
                                              sold largely to upscale independent menu restaurants, as well as hotels, other fine dining 
                                              establishments, country clubs and culinary schools, among others, all driven by a focus 
                                              on the chef and the cuisine served.

                                                  that caters to a different end-customer (namely the chef of the upscale independent menu 
                                                  restaurant). To that end, we find Chefs’ at its current stage of lifecycle very analogous to 
                                                  where UNFI was in the 1990s and early 2000’s, albeit with the advantage of having put 
                                                  technology into its busiest facility fairly early into its rapid growth cycle. UNFI, on the 
                                                  other hand, has struggled to get productivity enhancing tools deployed which we believe 
                                                  has hurt margins (although not the stock price all that much!). 

                                                  Buyer and supplier power are much more a factor for UNFI than they are for 
                                                  CHEF. Unlike CHEF, UNFI operates in the food-at-home channel, distributing largely to 
                                                  independent natural product retailers, supernatural chains (i.e. Whole Foods), as well as 
                                                  other conventional and mass retailers. Indeed, UNFI has a long-track record and a very 
                                                  dominant position in the  natural and organic industry, however significant buyer and 
                                                  supplier concentration do exist, namely in Whole Foods and Hain Celestial. UNFI is the 
                                                  largest distributor to Whole Foods, representing 35% of UNFI’s total net sales in FY10. In 
                                                  addition, roughly 7% of total purchases for UNFI come from Hain Celestial, the leading 
                                                  manufacturer of natural and organic food and related products.

     CHEF
                                                
     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                               UNFI  has  a  somewhat  similar  revenue  growth  profile  to  CHEF,  as  strong 
                                               organic growth rates are further supplemented by acquisitions, but CHEF’s 
                                               long-term EPS growth appears more favorable. Indeed, UNFI has grown net sales 
                                               at  a  roughly 15%  CAGR  since  fiscal  year  2000  and  we  estimate approximately 10.3% 
                                               revenue growth for UNFI next year (FY12: July). As it relates to Chefs’ Warehouse, we 
                                               estimate   organic  revenue  growth   of   10.5%  in   FY12  (Dec)  and   a  growth   rate   of 
                                               approximately 10% on average over the next five years (FY11-FY15). Indeed, aside from 
                                               already  announced  acquisitions  (Culinaire  Specialty  Foods  and  Harry  Wils)  we  do  not 
                                               incorporate acquisition-related growth into our model, which we believe could add a few 
                                               hundred basis points per year to sales. While both UNFI and CHEF have similar revenue 
                                               growth profiles, CHEF’s 3-year EPS CAGR of approximately 18% (based off our pro forma 
                                               FY11 EPS of $0.77 for comparison purposes) is higher than what we estimate for UNFI at 
                                               12%, over a similar time frame. While UNFI is farther along the maturation growth curve 
                                               than Chefs’ and is directly benefitting from a natural and organic secular tailwind (which 
                                               Chefs’ is not), we believe an EPS CAGR of 12-15% for UNFI is reasonable. 

                                               Chefs’  Warehouse  also  garners  a more favorable margin structure  than its 
                                               peers.  While  UNFI’s  business  in  recent  periods  has  grown  more  quickly  with  lower-
                                               margin conventional and mass customers, pressuring its gross margin before the lowered 
                                               cost to service those specific customers is able to offset, we believe the roughly 300-400 
                                               bps higher operating margin (and growing) at CHEF is attributable to three main factors. 
                                               First, we believe that Chefs’ ability to drive higher margins through the utilization and 
                                               leverage of its technology and infrastructure, such as its warehouse management system, 
                                               among others has allowed the company to reduce operating costs and benefit from sales 
                                               leverage, which should continue to improve over time. Second, the limited buyer and 
                                               supplier power faced by Chefs’ have allowed the company to capture better profits given 
                                               the fragmentation of its industry backdrop. Indeed, our research suggests that while other 
                                               regional or local competitors similar to Chefs’ may capture higher gross margins in certain 
                                               instances, Chefs’ is nevertheless able to deliver higher operating margins given the lower 
                                               cost to distribute and the benefits of its IT platform, a factor we believe should lead to 
                                               further improvement in operating margins over time. Finally, the very specialty nature of 
                                               Chefs’ products leads to higher gross margin in certain instances. 

                                               Moving on to Sysco, which we also see as a logical compare to CHEF, there are 
                                               perhaps   greater   relative   differences   to   CHEF   than   exhibited   by   UNFI, 
                                               suggesting the comparison,  while appropriate,  is not as strong.  Sysco is the 
                                               largest foodservice distributor  in North America, according to the company, with over 
                                               $39bn in sales in FY11 (July 2, 2011). Similar to Chefs’, SYY also operates in the broader 
                                               food-away-from-home  channel, while UNFI operates in the food-at-home channel.  SYY 
                                               largely services chain restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, hotels and motels, as well 
                                               as   schools   and   colleges,   among   others.  Of   the   three   large   broadline   foodservice 
                                               distributors, also including U.S. Foodservice and Performance Food Group, SYY is the only 
                                               public operator.

                                                    Despite  its  size,  SYY  has  a  much  lower  organic  growth  rate  and  a  lower

                                                    to CHEF, we believe. Indeed, since FY01 SYY has grown sales at a roughly 6% CAGR, 

                                                    less than half the 10-year CAGR rate of UNFI. In its recently ended FY11, SYY grew top-line 

                                                    at a similar 6% rate. Long-term organic sales growth for SYY is likely in the mid-single digit 

                                                    range as the company captures market share on-top of more moderate industry growth. 

                                                    Margins   at   SYY,   while   higher   than   UNFI,   still   trail   CHEF.  From   a   margin 

                                                    perspective, SYY commands higher operating margins than UNFI, averaging roughly 5% 

                                                    for SYY, but 3% for UNFI over the last few years. SYY’s operating margin, however still

                                              Discounted Cash Flow 

                                              Our conservative DCF value of approximately $20 suggests equity upside as 
                                              Chefs’  grows  and  drives  improved  operating  leverage.  We  assume  organic 
                                              growth of 11.2% and 10.5% in FY11 and FY12. Including the contribution from Chefs’ 
                                              Miami acquisition last year and its June 2011 acquisition of Harry Wils, we estimate 4.8% 
                                              and 3.3% of contribution in FY11 and FY12, respectively. FY11 is also a 53 week period, 
                                              which  we  estimate  adds  2.4%  to  sales  this  year,  while  reducing  sales  in  FY12  on  a 
                                              comparable y/y basis by 2.1%. All in, we estimate total sales growth of 18.5% and 11.6% 
                                              in  FY11  and  FY12,  respectively.  For  FY11  through  FY15  we  estimate  organic  sales  of 
                                              approximately 10% over the time period. We estimate total sales on average over the 
                                              FY12-FY20 period of 8.8%, with 4% sales growth in the terminal value. If we were to add 
                                              1% in revenue growth throughout the life of our model (starting in FY12 and excluding 
                                              the TV year) this would add approximately $1.50 to our DCF value. 

                                              We estimate improving EBIT margins over time. We estimate EBIT margin of 7.1% 
                                              in FY11 on a pro forma basis and 7.9% in FY12, driven largely by improved revenue and 
                                              operating expense leverage, with slight gross margin improvement. Our model assumes a 
                                              9%  EBIT  margin  is  achieved  by  FY17  and  remains  flat  at  9%  thereafter,  through  the 
                                              terminal value. According to our estimates, 100bps of margin difference spread equally 
                                              over FY12-FY17 adds or subtracts approximately $2.50 from our DCF value. 

                                              Depreciation and Amortization are estimated to grow in line with sales. We 
                                              have assumed $1.5mm and $8.3mm in CapEx in FY11 and FY12. The step-up next year is 
                                              due largely to the company’s move from its current Bronx NY facility to another in close 
                                              proximity. Over the long-term we slowly move CapEx (as a % of net revenue) higher as 
                                              the company  expands  its  business  over  time.  In  addition,  we  assume  working  capital 
                                              usage each year and assume a 39% tax rate. We also assume a weighted average cost of 
                                              capital for our DCF analysis of 9.7% with every ½ of one percent decrease boosting the 
                                              value of the DCF by approximately $2.30.

                                                Risks 

                                                Group purchasing organizations could potentially depress margins over the 
                                                long-term. The influx of group purchasing organizations over time into the independent 
                                                restaurant  channel  could  serve  to  depress  profitability  for  Chefs’  Warehouse.  Group 
                                                purchasing  organizations  largely  seek  to  aggregate  individual  parties  in  an  effort  to 
                                                improve the collective buying power of the group to a greater degree than could be done 
                                                on an individual basis. While these organizations  currently are  not as  prevalent in the 
                                                industry sub-sector in which Chefs’ participates as in other areas, if Chefs’ customers were 
                                                to join or form larger scale group purchasing organizations in an effort to reduce their 
                                                costs  of  buying  products  from Chefs’ and other  similar distributors, this could reduce 
                                                profitability for Chefs’ Warehouse. While we believe this represents the biggest potential 
                                                risk  for  the  company  over  the  long-term,  there  are  mitigating  factors,  including  the 
                                                extension  of  credit  to  customers.  Given  the  nature  of  the  industry,  Chefs’  regularly 
                                                extends credit to its customers, while group purchasing organizations largely do not.  We 
                                                also believe Chefs’ model and the unique relationships it has with its customers and the 
                                                chefs could help deter the formation of such groups in the company’s industry segment.  
                                                Finally, through its CRM and price optimization technologies Chefs makes sure it is not 
                                                fleecing its customers, particularly its high volume clients. 

                                                Strong  correlation  to   wealth   and   the   high-end   consumer  present   both 
                                                opportunity and risk for Chefs’ Warehouse. While Chefs’ business does fall into the 
                                                category   of   foodservice   distribution,   its   customers   largely   cater   to   the   higher-end 
                                                demographic and as a result Chefs’ business is strongly influenced by this segment of the 
                                                population.  Indeed,  with  a  correlation  of  0.80  between  Chefs’  organic  growth  and 
                                                household wealth, as defined by the Federal Reserve, there remains opportunity on the 
                                                upside  given   the strong  growth  exhibited  by  this  segment  despite  high  stagnant 
                                                unemployment  and  rising  prices  for  food  and  fuel  in  recent  periods.  However,  if  the 
                                                macro  economy  were   to   deteriorate,   leading   to   a   contraction   in   wealth   for   this 
                                                demographic in the U.S., Chefs’ sales and earnings would likely be negatively impacted. 
                                                Whole Foods, which by our calculation exhibits a similar correlation between its comp 
                                                sales and wealth, saw a noticeable decline in its sales during the 2008-2009 down turn. 
                                                To that end, we believe that Chefs’ organic sales could exhibit greater movement on the 
                                                upside and downside given the nature of the food-away-from-home segment, relative to 
                                                those similar companies that participate in the food-at-home channel such as UNFI and 
                                                Whole Foods for example.  However,  Chefs’  has made significant improvements on its 
                                                business since the last downturn which have provided greater strength, flexibility and 
                                                insight into its operations, better positioning the company for the long-term, as well as 
                                                helping to offset shorter-term macro weakness. Indeed, thus far our research has revealed 
                                                little if any slowing in the high-end food channel.

     CHEF
                                                 
     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                                Chefs’  operations  are  concentrated  in  New  York.  The  company’s  New  York 
                                                market,  which  falls  between  Atlantic  City  and  Boston,  but  is  largely  concentrated  in 
                                                greater   New   York   City,  is   the   largest   and   most   important   for   Chefs’.  Indeed, 
                                                approximately 65% of FY10 net revenues came from this geography, and we estimate a 
                                                significant portion of total company profitability. As such, any material adverse event as it 
                                                relates to Chefs’ business in this region could have a significant negative impact on the 
                                                company’s operations and results. In FY12, the company will be moving its DC to another 
                                                facility  in  very  close  proximity.  While  we  do  not  anticipate  any  significant  issues,  any 
                                                operational slowdown related to this move could impact results. 

                                                Acquisition growth adds execution risk. As Chefs’ Warehouse expands its presence 
                                                into  new  geographies,  the  company  will  look  to  add  customers  through  acquisition. 
                                                Indeed, over time the company has added to organic growth with acquisitions and we 
                                                expect this to continue. Over the last few years, the company has completed about one 
                                                acquisition per year, however, we expect this rate to increase to perhaps 2-3 transactions 
                                                per year on average as Chefs’ looks to grow outside its current geographies as well as 
                                                within current ones.  While any acquisition presents the possibility of execution-related 
                                                risk, there do tend to be some factors which help to mitigate risk for Chefs’. Transaction 
                                                sizes have historically been small, with three of Chefs’ last four at or below $5mm and the 
                                                latest transaction under $10mm, although any future transactions could in fact be larger. 
                                                In addition, many transactions involve the purchase of customer lists and related items, 
                                                along with inventory and working capital, suggesting more limited integration risk. 

                                                Technology and systems implementation risk. The company is moving to bring its 
                                                systems outside of New York. While we believe this process will be smooth, it does create 
                                                some temporary execution risk as the systems are deployed. 

                                                Excessive  inflation  or  deflation  could  present  challenges  for  the  company. 
                                                Indeed, higher costs for food inputs could raise the cost to produce for suppliers and in 
                                                turn reduce the company’s gross margin or make it more difficult to pass along to its 
                                                customers. One factor that helps to mitigate some risk in a period of rising food inputs is 
                                                that Chefs’ distributes a wide variety of products which on  a relative basis are not as 
                                                heavily  tied  to  one  specific  commodity  input.  However,  the  company  does  remain 
                                                exposed  to  rising  fuel  prices.  While  there  is  some  pass  through  pricing  ability,  the 
                                                company  does  not  employ  sophisticated  hedging  strategies  and  significant  or  sharp 
                                                increases in fuel prices could have a negative impact on results. In addition, prolonged 
                                                periods of deflation or falling prices would also likely present challenges for Chefs’ as the 
                                                company uses higher sales to help leverage fixed costs.

Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.
Restricted - Describes issuers where, in conjunction with Jefferies engagement in certain transactions, company policy or applicable securities
regulations prohibit certain types of communications, including investment recommendations.
Monitor - Describes stocks whose company fundamentals and financials are being monitored, and for which no financial projections or opinions on
the investment merits of the company are provided.

Valuation Methodology
Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total
return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market
risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF,
P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns,
and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.
