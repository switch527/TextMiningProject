INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and scale undoubtedly offers 
advantages. Our thesis was further supported last week as we hosted the company for two 
days of investor meetings. While the current momentum is obvious in the financial results 
and the geographical growth opportunity has been illustrated with strategic acquisitions 
over the last several years into new markets, we believe that the expansion opportunities 
in existing markets are not fully appreciated. We suspect that the catalyst for new product 
categories will occur in early 2013 when the company opens a new distribution center in 
New York. The facility will provide immediate efficiencies for CHEF’s largest market, but 
should also provide the capacity for expansion into large new categories, such as produce, 
seafood and cut meats. The category expansion opportunities could double the market 
opportunity for CHEF. 

The geographical growth opportunity is clear with CHEF operating in just seven markets 
today. However, the magnitude of the opportunity is larger than we had anticipated with 
the company targeting more major markets as viable entries than we’d assumed. 
Essentially every NFL city with the exception of Green Bay (although nearby Milwaukee 
would be served out of a Chicago entry) is a target that could support a Chef’s Warehouse 
entry. This implies more than a quadrupling of the current market presence (CHEF already 
operates in two non-NFL cities: Los Angeles and Las Vegas). With acquisition opportunities 
in numerous new markets, yet still opportunities for tuck-ins to existing markets, the 
opportunity for growth through industry consolidation is significant. Beyond the simple 
math of new market opportunities, the benefits of scale from a true national presence have 
yet to even be realized and CHEF is already delivering strong gross and EBITDA margins. 

Given the inherent growth of specialty foods in all channels of distribution, CHEF’s ability 
to grow market share in existing markets through a superior offering and infrastructure, 
along with growth opportunities through both geographic and category expansion, should 
deliver a long-term double-digit growth opportunity that is measured in decades. We 
reiterate our BUY rating and $24 price target and confidently foresee an above-average 
growth rate that justifies the current valuation. 

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 23x our 2012 EPS forecast and 11x 
our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
traditional food distribution peer group multiples (generally in the low teens on forward 
earnings and 7-8x EBITDA), the valuation is at a slight discount to its best and only real 
comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : 
$47.12). We view UNFI as the best comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally 
growing market, superior margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18%, UNFI’s gross 
margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We 
continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on invested 
capital.  

                                                                                           

                                                                                          113

                                                                      26 March 2012 

                                                                                            
We maintain our price target of $24.00, which reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA forecast and 
22x our 2013 EPS estimate, which is consistent with where CHEF currently trades on 
forward EBITDA and reflects the premium valuations of the specialty food peer group. 

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 
•   A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
    commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
    consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have 
    had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. 
    Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 
•   Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, 
    the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and 
    spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness 
    have impacted the performance of the shares. 
•   Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in 
    the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies 
    with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and 
    United Natural Foods. 
•   Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
    Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's 
    total sales originated from the New York market.  
•   Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history 
    and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is 
    highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
    acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of 
    key personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or 
    distribution gains.  
•   Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
    concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands 
    sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  
•   Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state 
    and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require 
    various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar 
    regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food 
    products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public 
    awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and 
    organic products 
•   Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
    profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its 
    trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the 
    destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 
In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.
