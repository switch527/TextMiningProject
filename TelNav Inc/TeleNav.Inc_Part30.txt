                                   Investment Summary            

                                   TeleNav is a well-established provider of navigation and Location-Based Services (LBS), a 
                                   growing, but increasingly competitive space.  TeleNav currently has a high revenue growth 
                                   rate (FY 2010 revenues grew by 54%), but there is risk to future growth, ARPU and the 
                                   sustainability  of  the  current  customer  count  due  to  TeleNav’s  customer  concentration.  
                                   90% of revenues are derived from Sprint and AT&T customers, with 55% of its revenues 
                                   coming  from  Sprint  customers  and  the  Sprint  contract  currently  in  renegotiations  (the 
                                   contract with AT&T could end in 2011).  While we foresee a sizeable market opportunity 
                                   in the LBS space, a number of large competitors with deep pockets (namely Google and 
                                   Apple) have the ability to offer LBS services for free in order to build a customer base.  
                                   Google has already offered free turn-by-turn navigation on certain Android smartphones 
                                   and Apple is leading the industry in integrated mobile advertising.  The proliferation of the 
                                   leading smartphone operating systems has simplified the process for writing software for 
                                   multiple vendors, and, in our opinion, lowered the barrier to entry for getting new location-
                                   based applications onto devices. 

                                   We rate TeleNav Neutral primarily due to the risks associated with the Sprint contract 
                                   renewal and the competitive threats faced by the company.  Our $6 price target is based on 
                                   a scenario analysis of different Sprint contract outcomes.  If the company were to resolve 
                                   the  renegotiation  overhang  in  a  favorable  manner,  we  think  the  stock  would  react  in 
                                   positive manner.  We would also use that opportunity to re-evaluate our rating. 

                                   TeleNav is a leading provider of Location Based Services for mobile applications.  The 
                                   company’s  flagship  product  is  handset-based  turn-by-turn  mobile  navigation  services, 
                                   although    TeleNav    also    provides    vehicle-based    navigation    services,    location-based 
                                   advertising  services  and  enterprise  mobile  resource  management  services.    TeleNav’s 
                                   navigation services are offered primarily through wireless carriers as a white label service 
                                   and  revenues  are  generated  on  a  monthly  subscription  fee  basis.    As  of  June  30,  2010, 
                                   TeleNav had 16.1 million customers subscribed to its service.  The base case used in our 
                                   valuation is rooted in a discounted cash flow analysis using a cost of capital of 16.0%, and 
                                   a  terminal  growth  rate  of  3.0%.      On  an  EV/EBITDA  basis,  our  target  price  implies 
                                   multiples  of  3.2  times  estimated  CY2010  EBITDA  and  3.5  times  estimated  CY2011 
                                   EBITDA. 

                                    

                                   Investment Thesis and Valuation 

                                   TeleNav is a market leader in wireless Location Based Services (“LBS”); a market we 
                                   believe is in the early stages of a multi-year growth cycle.  As more and more customers 
                                   adopt smartphones, the usage of LBS applications like navigation is likely to increase.  
                                   Despite our outlook for strong industry growth, TeleNav faces real challenges in its 
                                   renegotiations with Sprint and from external competition.  Our Neutral rating is based on 
                                   our view that the potential for long-term stock appreciation is overshadowed by these near-
                                   term risks.  In our base case earnings model, we assume that the Sprint contract is extended, 
                                   but with a 20% reduction in ARPU.  Using this assumption, our earnings model yields a 
                                   discounted cash flow valuation of $7.  We believe this is the most likely outcome with a

                                                                                                        September 10, 2010  
                                    

                                   for 55% of TeleNav’s revenues, and that a contract extension is likely to result in a decrease 
                                   in ARPU and total revenues. The contract was scheduled to expire at the end of 2011, with 
                                   TeleNav exclusivity scheduled to end December 31, 2010.   

                                   Sprint is a very important customer of TeleNav.  Not only does it account for 55% of 
                                   TeleNav’s revenues, but it is responsible for an even higher percentage of TeleNav’s 
                                   subscriber count.  This is because Sprint, unlike AT&T (who accounts for 35% of 
                                   revenues), bundles the TeleNav navigation service in its all-inclusive data plans and 
                                   TeleNav generates a lower ARPU per bundled customer than it does for a customer who 
                                   subscribes to the service directly.  As location based services (LBS) grows as an industry, we 
                                   believe capturing a high user count will be an important component of survival and 
                                   prosperity.  To this end, we believe TeleNav will want to keep its service bundled for Sprint 
                                   users. 

                                   So what are the possible outcomes?  TeleNav would most likely want to extend the contract 
                                   with roughly the same framework.  But, in order to win an extension of its exclusive 
                                   contract, TeleNav is likely going to have to concede on price.  Sprint customer ARPU is 
                                   already below the average due to bundling, and we question how much lower TeleNav 
                                   would be willing to go on price.  ARPU at the end of fiscal 4Q10 was $1.03, down from 
                                   $1.18 reported one year earlier.   

                                   The worst outcome would be if Sprint decided it was going to unbundle navigation from its 
                                   plans and/or drop TeleNav as a provider.  While this would be disastrous, we think it is 
                                   unlikely given that the last thing Sprint would want to do is to tick off its subscribers by 
                                   either telling them navigation is no longer available or asking them to now pay for it 
                                   separately (amounting to a service plan price increase).  Another outcome is that Sprint 
                                   could decide to no longer bundle the service in new service plans (keeping the service free 
                                   for existing service pan contracts), which would lower TeleNav’s growth rate, but not put a 
                                   large amount of existing revenues at risk.  Yet another scenario is that Sprint could decide 
                                   to add another navigation provider either as a co-supplier of the service with TeleNav or as 
                                   a new sole supplier.  Both of these scenarios could also put a large percentage of revenues at 
                                   risk. 

                                   While it is nearly impossible to predict the outcome of the negotiations, we have 
                                   incorporated the most probable scenarios into our earnings model and valuation, as we 
                                   mentioned earlier.  Exhibit 2, below, illustrates the four scenarios we use in our model and 
                                   the probabilities we have assigned to each.  Keep in mind, however, that even when the 
                                   Sprint contract overhang is settled, TeleNav will still need to address its agreement with 
                                   AT&T that expires in March 2011.  Recall that AT&T customers represent 35% of 
                                   revenues. 

                                   Our earnings model is based on our base case, to which we assign a 60% probability and 
                                   which assumes a 20% price cut for Sprint in fiscal 3Q11 and a corresponding 20% price cut 
                                   at AT&T in fiscal 2Q12.  The model is highly sensitive to changes in this outcome, 
                                   however.  If the price cut was 30% instead of 20%, our fiscal 2012 EBITDA would be 
                                   reduced by 30% and EPS would be reduced by 45% (both assuming constant costs).  Our 
                                   discounted cash flow model would yield a per share equity value of $5 in this scenario.  
                                   Alternatively, 10% price cut (versus our assumed 20%) would result in a nearly 30% 
                                   increase in fiscal 2012 EBITDA and a DCF valuation of more than $9.

                                      Is TeleNav A Takeout Candidate? 

                                      Possibly.  TeleNav has a desirable set of technologies and a growing user base, which could 
                                      be useful to a larger internet or mobile service provider looking to get into mobile location-
                                      based services.  However, the fact that TeleNav is often sold as a white-label service 
                                      diminishes this possibility.  If another company wanted simply to grow its user base of 
                                      navigation services (potentially to market and sell LBS advertising services), it would not 
                                      need to purchase TeleNav outright.  Instead, this other company could offer navigation 
                                      services to Sprint and/or AT&T at better terms, replacing TeleNav as the provider and 
                                      getting access to subscribers that account for up to 90% of TeleNav’s revenues today.  

                                                        

                                      Investment Risks 

                                      Customer concentration.   TeleNav supplies its LBS offerings primarily through wireless 
                                      carriers.  With the U.S. currently being the leading market for LBS services, TeleNav 
                                      generates the majority of its revenue through its largest two carrier customers.  As such, 
                                      Sprint currently represents 55% of sales in while AT&T represents 35% of sales.  As we 
                                      outlined above, the Sprint contract is currently being negotiated and the company has 
                                      warned that the outcome could likely result in a reduction in ARPU.   The AT&T contract 
                                      expires in March 2011.   

                                      Larger Competitors Could Offer LBS for Free:    While TeleNav’s service offering is tough 
                                      to duplicate and its integration with carrier partners create high switching costs, the mobile 
                                      navigation market is in the early stages of growth and competing technologies could drive 
                                      down prices or change market dynamics.  Currently, TeleNav works with all major 
                                      smartphone Operating Systems (“OS’s”).  However, Google’s Android OS is gaining

                                      offers free navigation services.

                                                                                                        September 10, 2010  
                                    

                                   Google has created a map service and now offers free guided, turn by turn navigation as 
                                   part of its Google Maps product for Android smartphones.  With its purchase of 
                                   NAVTEQ, Nokia now has a leading global map database and offers navigation and 
                                   mapping services to owners of Nokia smartphones for free.  Microsoft’s new Windows 7 
                                   OS will also offer free navigation service.  While Windows has limited market share to date, 
                                   it is another large company competing with TeleNav.  If Nokia, Microsoft, and Google 
                                   penetrate wireless carriers with free mobile navigation service, then TeleNav’s sales growth 
                                   could be at risk.  

                                   Inability To Win New Carrier Partners.   While long-term TeleNav can grow revenues 
                                   through its enterprise, automotive and advertising/search businesses, we believe near-term 
                                   growth will be driven by the core mobile navigation product.  Any inability for TeleNav to 
                                   continue to grow its carrier partners could negatively impact revenue growth rates. 

                                   Pricing Risk.   Given the current negotiation of the Sprint contract, the upcoming expiration 
                                   of the AT&T contract and the fact that Google is beginning to offer mobile navigation for 
                                   free, the carriers and consumers have considerable power to demand lower pricing for 
                                   navigation services.  In addition, if the carriers were to increase the pricing of TeleNav’s 
                                   services to end users, TeleNav could lose customers. 

                                   Bundling.   TeleNav benefited from Sprint’s decision to bundle navigation services into the 
                                   Any Mobile and Simply Everything plans.  A decision to unbundle the product could result 
                                   in a material decline in the number of customers subscribing to TeleNav’s services. 

                                   Competition for New LBS Services.   TeleNav strives to expand into leading edge LBS 
                                   services like paid mobile search and advertising.  While TeleNav’s carrier relationships are 
                                   strong assets, we know that Apple and Google are also interested in mobile LBS advertising 
                                   and could be overwhelming competitors. 

                                   Litigation Risk.   In recent weeks, multiple law firms have announced class action lawsuits 
                                   against TeleNav alleging false and misleading statements in its registration statement.  
                                   Because TeleNav announced the renegotiation of the Sprint contract within months of 
                                   closing its IPO, we believe some investors will question when management knew of this 
                                   development.  As such, there is likely to be some headline litigation risk for the foreseeable 
                                   future.  

                                   Intellectual Property.   TeleNav has been granted 19 patents with 50 pending to date, but 
                                   numerous other companies also claim rights to different navigation and LBS technologies.  
                                   TeleNav has limited outstanding lawsuits to date, although its carrier customers offering its 
                                   service have been sued and TeleNav offers its carriers indemnification provisions.  Due to 
                                   these and any potential future lawsuits, TeleNav could face mounting legal expenses.   

                                   Map Data.   The largest component to TeleNav’s cost of revenues is the fees paid for map 
                                   and Point Of Information (POI) data.  TeleNav dual-sources this data from both Tele Atlas 
                                   and NAVTEQ in order to keep pricing in check, but future price increases could negatively 
                                   impact margins.  

                                   Lock-up Expiration.   On November 10, 2010, the 180-day lock up period post TeleNav’s 
                                   initial public offering will expire, giving many shareholders the opportunity to sell their 
                                   TeleNav stock.  At the time of the IPO, owners of nearly 35 million shares were restricted

                                   overhang on the stock due to additional selling pressure, we think the near-term effects will 
                                   be minimal given the recent decline in share price. 

                                                                                                    

                                   LBS Industry Overview 

                                   Mobile location based services (LBS) is essentially the use of embedded GPS technology to 
                                   provide location-specific information and services.  Mobile navigation is the most obvious 
                                   application of LBS, but advertising, social networking, and many other services are likely to 
                                   use the technology as well. As smartphone penetration and the use of mobile applications 
                                   continue to grow, we expect the mobile LBS market to enter a phase of strong growth over 
                                   the next few years.  As LBS navigation services ramp in sales over the next several years, we 
                                   expect it to cannibalize a portion of the $12B PND (Personal/Portable Navigation Device) 
                                   market.    

                                   Sizing The Market Opportunity 

                                   While the LBS market is still nascent, we believe the rapid adoption of smartphones taking 
                                   place today, along with the explosion in mobile application development and usage will 
                                   result in accelerating consumer adoption and revenue generation for LBS services over the 
                                   next several years.  Nearly every smartphone sold today includes GPS capabilities and the 
                                   carriers are continually looking for ways to monetize their investment in next generation 
                                   data networks.  Research firm Gartner has predicted that the global location based services 
                                   market will grow from just over $2 billion in 2009 and 2010 to more than $8 billion in 2014.  
                                   In its forecast, Gartner assumes that personal navigation, which made up 75% of all 
                                   location-based revenues in 2009 will account for approximately 40% of all location-based 
                                   revenues in 2014.  Services such as location-based search and social networking applications 
                                   are predicted to be responsible for much of the growth.  Separately, eMarketer estimated in 
                                   a 2009 report that U.S. mobile advertising will grow to $1.6 billion on 2013 from a mere 
                                   $320 million in 2008.  

                                   Not only will the applications that derive the revenues shift over time, but the expected 
                                   payers of the revenue are expected to shift from the consumer end-user to advertisers.  We 
                                   believe that over the next 5 years, advertising-derived LBS revenues could account for at 
                                   least 70% of U.S.  LBS revenues (see Exhibit 3).

                                   Company Overview 

                                   TeleNav is a leading provider of Location Based Services for mobile applications.  The 
                                   company’s flagship product is handset-based turn-by-turn mobile navigation services, 
                                   although TeleNav also provides vehicle-based navigation services, location-based 
                                   advertising services and enterprise mobile resource management services.  TeleNav’s 
                                   navigation services are offered primarily through wireless carriers as a white label service 
                                   and revenues are generated on a monthly subscription fee basis.  As of June 30, 2010, 
                                   TeleNav had 16.1 million customers subscribed to its service.  

                                    

                                   Product Offerings 

                                   GPS Navigator – TeleNav’s flagship product offering is its GPS Navigator service, which is 
                                   predominantly accessed today through various mobile handsets, but is also available via in-
                                   dash automotive solutions and TeleNav’s own portable navigation device (not unlike a 
                                   Garmin or Tom Tom device available at retailers today).  The GPS Navigator product 
                                   provides voice-guided, turn-by-turn navigation with a feature set that includes  3-D moving 
                                   maps, automatic re-routing for missed turns; over 13 million points of interest (POI), real-
                                   time traffic, gas prices, and the ability to pre-plan trips via the TeleNav website.   

                                   TeleNav’s navigation service is differentiated from traditional navigation products by its 
                                   subscription model (more on this below), but also through its server-based architecture (see 
                                   Exhibit 4).  By obtaining map, route and POI data directly from TeleNav in real-time, users 
                                   are assured of having the latest available information without the need to update or replace 
                                   their device, often a costly proposition.

                                  TeleNav’s GPS Navigator is available through 15 wireless carriers in approximately 29 
                                  countries today.  However, the majority of revenues are derived from AT&T and Sprint, 
                                  where TeleNav offers its GPS Navigator product as a white label service. GPS Navigator is 
                                  available on all major mobile operating systems, including the popular iOS and Android 
                                  operating systems.  Over 500 handsets are TeleNav capable today, and carriers often pre-
                                  load the software onto the handset.  Mobile Navigation accounted for 94% of FY2010 
                                  revenues (91% derived from US operations, 3% derived internationally). 

                                  Automotive – More recently, TeleNav has been working to bring its navigation services to 
                                  the in-dash automotive market.  The company’s first in-dash product was available on 2010 
                                  Ford Focus and Taurus models.  The product was predominantly voice driven and required 
                                  a cellular voice connection to transmit navigation data.  There was not a large LCD screen 
                                  showing a visual map, and the navigation directions were all orally given over the car’s 
                                  speaker system.  Nevertheless, this Ford SYNC solution had a much lower cost than 
                                  traditional in-car navigation systems and thus had a broader consumer reach. 

                                  For the next version of TeleNav’s in-dash product, we expect the company to marry its 
                                  navigation services with an in-dash screen.  Connected with TeleNav’s servers, the device 
                                  will be able to provide real-time traffic, gas prices and frequently updated maps.  TeleNav 
                                  expects this service to be available in the U.S. on certain 2011 model cars (definitely with 
                                  Ford and discussions are ongoing with other manufacturers).   

                                  Stagnation of traditional in-dash navigation and falling prices in portable navigation 
                                  devices has created an opening for TeleNav to enter the in-dash market.  Auto

                                   manufactures have liked selling navigation with new vehicles because it helps them to 
                                   generate more profit.  However, the in-dash manufacturers have kept prices high at the 
                                   same time that portable devices have gotten cheaper than ever, resulting in increased 
                                   adoption of portable devices at the expense of in-dash navigation.  TeleNav presents a 
                                   unique solution to this problem for car manufacturers.  TeleNav licenses its technology to 
                                   the manufacturer for about $100 per device, and the total installed cost is much cheaper 
                                   than a typically in-dash system today.  Not only is it cheaper, but the TeleNav system also 
                                   provides more functionality including real-time information and automatically-updated 
                                   maps. 

                                   Mobile Resource Management – TeleNav offers enterprises a suite of services to help them 
                                   manage mobile workforces and vehicle fleets.  Services include TeleNav Track, TeleNav 
                                   Vehicle Manager, TeleNav Vehicle Tracker and TeleNav Asset Tracker.  These solutions 
                                   allow enterprises to better manage their workforces by integrating enterprise back-office 
                                   systems with turn-by-turn directions to help workers get to their destinations, real-time and 
                                   historical reports of locations and travel times, updated job status information, automatic 
                                   alerts when a worker of vehicles enters or leaves a location, and customizable wireless 
                                   forms to capture field information.  TeleNav is a top-two leader in the enterprise mobile 
                                   resource management space. 

                                   Location-Based Advertising – While not a meaningful part of TeleNav today, location-
                                   based advertising services has the potential to become a big revenue driver in the future.  
                                   Beginning in late 2009, TeleNav deployed mobile-based advertising solutions to a limited 
                                   number of end users; features included location specific sponsored listings, content, 
                                   coupons and dining menus.  Future possibilities include the potential for TeleNav to get 
                                   paid for navigating customers to certain locations after they perform a search. 

                                    

                                   Billing Models                

                                   TeleNav’s core GPS Navigator revenues are subscription based, either billed to end-users as 
                                   a standalone product or as part of a bundle of services offered by wireless carriers.  
                                   Customers on the subscription-based model will choose to have navigation services on their 
                                   device for a monthly fee typically ranging from $7-10.  Often, the carrier (in conjunction 
                                   with TeleNav) will offer a free month of service to entice the user to sign up longer-term.  
                                   In addition, the TeleNav application is also usually pre-loaded onto the devices – again to 
                                   help spur adoption.  AT&T customers are subscription-based. 

                                   For the bundled model, carriers will include navigation as part of a service plan – customers 
                                   do not have to opt-in and they are not explicitly charged for the service.  Sprint currently 
                                   bundles TeleNav’s navigation in its all-inclusive data plans (Simply Everything and Any 
                                   Mobile plans).  Bundling gives TeleNav a much broader customer set, but TeleNav 
                                   commands a much lower ARPU for a bundled customer compared to that of a stand-alone 
                                   customer. 

                                   In either case, customers are billed by the wireless carriers and the revenues (less some 
                                   margin to the carriers) are passed on to TeleNav.  We believe this arrangement is a strength 
                                   of TeleNav’s business model.  Customers do not have to set up and pay a separate bill, 
                                   TeleNav does not have to develop its own billing system or take on separate credit risk, and

                                   the carriers get a piece of the action.  This relationship with the carriers could act as a 
                                   barrier for competitors looking to get into TeleNav’s newest offerings, such as location-
                                   based advertising. 

                                    

                                   Competitors 

                                   Up until a year ago, when the Motorola Droid was released, TeleNav faced very real, but 
                                   manageable competition.  TeleNav’s GPS Navigator was a lower cost option than 
                                   traditional in-vehicle navigation and could be used across multiple vehicles.  Compared to 
                                   portable navigation devices (PNDs), TeleNav may have been cheaper (depending upon the 
                                   assumed lifespan of the PND), but it was certainly more portable, always had up-to-date 
                                   maps, and could incorporate real-time data.   

                                   With the Droid, however, Google introduced its own, free turn-by-turn navigation 
                                   software.  Today, Google Navigation is only available on a subset of Android-based 
                                   devices, which themselves represent a subset of handsets that can access TeleNav’s GPS 
                                   Navigator application.  We can objectively say that TeleNav’s offering is better than that of 
                                   Google today, but it’s hard to compete with a free product and Google could easily use its 
                                   warchest to improve its offering.  Google could also roll out the product to all Android 
                                   devices and could ultimately make it available to other devices, like the Apple iPhone.  
                                   While TeleNav’s service is superior today, we think Google navigation could be a 
                                   meaningful threat in the future, especially if it remains free. 

                                   TeleNav faces competition in the navigation space from established PND manufacturers 
                                   like Garmin and TomTom, other mobile navigation providers like Network In Motion, and 
                                   from Nokia, who bundles its own navigation product with its phone.  It is certainly a 
                                   diverse competitive environment, but there is plenty of opportunity for TeleNav to increase 
                                   its share.  TeleNav currently provides service to less than 7% of total US wireless customers 
                                   and to a much smaller percentage of global wireless customers.

                                   TeleNav also stands to face stiff competition in its emerging business lines, namely 
                                   location-based advertising.  Once again, Google is likely to become a big player in this 
                                   space, given their footholds in the mapping, internet search, and now the mobile OS arenas.  
                                   Apple is a competitor too with its recently debuted iAds platform for placement of 
                                   advertisements in mobile applications.  While the emergence of competitive location-based 
                                   advertising services from Google and Apple could actually help raise awareness with 
                                   potential advertisers and improve the economics for TeleNav, we still view Google and 
                                   Apple as large risks.  We believe TeleNav’s ultimate success in mobile advertising will 
                                   depend on two factors: TeleNav’s ability to obtain a large user base for its navigation 
                                   services and the company’s continued revenue-sharing relationships with the wireless 
                                   carriers.  As long as TeleNav has a meaningful base of customers using its mobile 
                                   navigation services, it should be able to monetize those users’ searches.  In addition, the 
                                   company’s historical revenue sharing agreements with the carriers could help TeleNav 
                                   achieve some sort of preferential treatment on end-users devices. 

                                   In the in-dash, automotive market, TeleNav is the new entrant and thus doesn’t face large 
                                   competitive threats that put revenues at risk.  TeleNav has a superior, lower-cost product 
                                   that should be able to generate added value.  In its mobile resource management business 
                                   line, TeleNav faces day-to-day competition in winning new contracts, namely from 
                                   industry leader Xora, but nothing that is incrementally disruptive to the business model.

                                                                                                       September 10, 2010  
                                   

                                  TeleNav as a Brand? 

                                  TeleNav’s flagship GPS Navigator product is primarily sold as a white-label product to the 
                                  majority of customers.  That is, customers are buying “Sprint Navigation” or “AT&T 
                                  Navigator” and not “TeleNav.”  This has been an acceptable arrangement for TeleNav, as 
                                  getting its service sold to these customers has helped the company expand its users base.  
                                  Looking ahead, though, we believe a branded product could be beneficial as TeleNav looks 
                                  to capitalize on other location-based services like advertising.  Building a strong brand 
                                  could help TeleNav become a go-to portal for location searching, which again would help 
                                  build advertising revenues.  We would not be surprised to see TeleNav pursue a branded 
                                  product strategy as it re-negotiates with its carrier partners.  

                                   

                                  Geographic Presence 

                                  North America.   TeleNav has a strong presence in the North America market with 3 of the 
                                  4 major carriers selecting TeleNav for its service offering.  With AT&T, Sprint, and T-
                                  Mobile choosing TeleNav, we believe TeleNav has strong growth opportunities with these 
                                  three carriers, given TeleNav has 16M subscribers and these 3 carriers have nearly 160M 
                                  subscribers.  Network in Motion is TeleNav’s primary competitor in North America 
                                  through its service offering for Verizon’s mobile navigation service.  AT&T offers 
                                  competing mobile navigation services along with TeleNav, but TeleNav is the AT&T 
                                  branded service.  TomTom, Garmin, and others offer mobile navigation applications on 
                                  AT&T’s iPhone, but even on the iPhone the TeleNav service is the most used.   

                                  Europe and Asia.   Europe and Asia represent growth opportunities for TeleNav, evidenced 
                                  by the fact that 30% of the company’s resources are focused on international operations 
                                  despite generating only 4% of revenues.  Europe is still in the early stages of offering mobile 
                                  phone navigation services, creating a potential opportunity for TeleNav; today, Telmap of 
                                  Israel is the early market leader.  Vodafone was in the process of building its own service 
                                  offering following its acquisition of Wayfinder in December 2008 for roughly $33M. 
                                  However, Vodafone announced it is closing down Wayfinder in March 2010 as it believes it 
                                  is no longer viable for Vodafone to continue to develop and operate its own navigation 
                                  products. As such, Vodafone has indicated it will partner with other companies such as 
                                  Nokia and Google to offer navigation and location based services.  

                                  Asia is also in the early stages of offering mobile navigation services, but we believe this is a 
                                  potentially large market opportunity given the demographics and large installed base of 
                                  mobile phones.  TeleNav could be well-positioned in the Asia market, as it counts China 
                                  Mobile, the world’s largest wireless operator, as its customer. 

                                   

                                  Recent Results 

                                  TeleNav reported its first quarterly results (fiscal 4Q10) since its initial public offering on 
                                  July 29, 2010.  Fourth quarter revenues grew 45% to $49.5M compared to the previous 
                                  year, while net income grew 3% year-over-year.  The average number of paying monthly 
                                  customers grew 69% to 16.1 million.  Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) declined 13%

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
