ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS, $54.73, Buy, Price Target: $62)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like what we view as ANSYS global franchise in advanced simulation applications, and expect the companys cyclical 
demand fundamentals to continue strengthening over the course of 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we like the alignment 
between global wireless technology demand, and integration of electro-magnetic simulation with fluid and mechanical 
multiphysics in the flagship ANSYS (current version 13) platform. We regard the version 13 product cycle as a major 
product release which we expect to further spur cross-sale efforts in CY11, and motivate a new group of select, certified 
channel dealers.   
 
Valuation  
Our $62 price target is based on a 24x P/E on our CY2012 EPS estimate of $2.58. The design peer group median current-
year P/E multiple is currently 22x. We believe that ANSS shares deserve a premium valuation, based on what we view as 
the company's unique competitive strengths and first-ever scale attributes in simulation applications for manufacturing and 
process industries. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
ANSYS is historically acquisitive; acquisitions may involve product and organizational integration challenges: We believe 
CY11 will see ANSYS more active again with its M&A strategy, perhaps to consolidate market share or possibly add 
selected vertical market depth to its applications. ANSYS has capital-intensive end markets. Several of ANSYS' largest 
verticals,  including aerospace, automobiles and  industrial  equipment are  very  cyclical and subject to the more harsh 
capital constraints of those particular end markets.     
 
 
Aruba Networks, Inc.  (NASDAQ: ARUN, $27.61, Buy, Price Target: $38)  
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Potential Near Term Catalyst   
ARUN's third consecutive  quarter  of accelerating top-line growth suggests to us that the WLAN secular  trend  is just 
beginning and  ARUN, given  its security-based  differentiation and solid execution,  is benefiting disproportionately  and 
gaining  significant  share.  While  the  sequential  GM  decline  (attributed  to  mix-shift  to  international  geographies)  was 
surprising, we believe as US re-accelerates in upcoming quarters, ARUN's GM should rebound, providing a tailwind to OM 
expansion. Given our belief that ARUN's rapid growth, indirect model, and high repeat purchase rate in installed base 
should result in materially higher earnings power beyond current Street estimates, we reiterate our Buy rating.   
 
Longer term, we believe the rapid proliferation of wi-fi devices and the October 2009 ratification of the 802.11n standard 
are strong catalysts of WLAN adoption across the globe, and are driving a strong wireless networking secular trend. As 
enterprises move to 802.11n WLANs, it creates a need for a significant upgrade to WLAN infrastructure, which is unlike 
the change from 11b to 11g, creating a significant opportunity for ARUN to gain market share.  ARUN is the largest WLAN 
pure-play  and  the  mind-share  leader  in  the  market,  which  we  believe  is  a  result  of  ARUN's  superior  security-based 
differentiation.  Security, according to our checks, is the most important concern for enterprise WLAN prospects, and 
considering enhancing this differentiation has been ARUNs R&D focus in recent times (as evident from the companys 
analyst  day  and  product  announcements)  which  gives  us  reason  to  believe  that  ARUN  can  continue  to  benefit 
disproportionately from secular trends.   
 
Valuation  
Our $38 ARUN price target is based on an ex-cash 54x PE multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.68, considering our 
40% long-term growth assumption implies a PEG of 1.3x, which we believe is appropriate, given what we view as ARUN's 
superior positioning in an early-stage high-growth opportunity and its superior execution as reflected in its fast expanding 
operating model.

Risks to Price Target 
In addition to the typical competitive risks, other investment risks include the dependence on the adoption of advanced 
technologies by customers, lengthening sales cycles, dependence on outsourced manufacturing, dependence on sales 
through VARs and OEMs, and adverse effects of international conflicts on operations or business conditions.   
 
 
Entropic Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ENTR, $8.41, Buy, Price Target: $13)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We view Entropic as a key investment theme that benefits from the widespread adoption of Multimedia-over-coax (MOCA) 
technology for distributing high definition, premium video content within the home for multi-room DVR installations. We 
believe that the market is still early in MoCA penetration with an eventual run-rate opportunity of 40 million MoCA chips 
per  year  and  potential  longer-term  growth  opportunities  such  as  MoCA  2.0  platforms  and  high-volume  consumer 
electronics such as HDTVs, Blu-Ray players, game consoles, PCs etc. We expect the company to see continuing good 
business momentum over the next 12 months driven by multiple cable, satellite, and telco service providers rolling out 
MOCA based multi-room DVR premium video services.   
 
Valuation  
Our $13 price target is based on a P/E of 15x our calendar 2012E EPS of $0.85 relative to our outlook for 15% secular 
earnings growth. We believe that a 15x target P/E multiple is justified relative to our outlook for 15% secular earnings 
growth using a PEG ratio of 100% and assuming that ENTR remains a dominant, high-growth provider of networked home 
entertainment system-level solutions with high entry barriers. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
The key investment risks for Entropic Communications are: 1) the market for its products is highly competitive, and they 
face competition from a number of established companies. 2) The company receives a substantial portion of revenues 
from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or a few of its major 
customers would likely adversely affect its operations and financial condition. The company's growth is dependent on the 
deployments  plans  for multi-room  HD  video  distribution  by  a  small  group  of  cable  service  providers;  satellite  service 
providers; and telco service providers. Any delay in deployment plans by these customers could materially affect revenues 
for Entropic. 3) Average selling prices of products in markets served have historically decreased over time and will likely 
do so in the future, which could harm revenues and gross profits.  
 
 
Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc.   (NYSE: FCS, $15.85, Buy, Price Target: $22)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
We view Fairchild Semiconductor as well positioned with its power and analog products to benefit from customer focus on 
mobility and energy efficiency. We expect increasing content and margin expansion to drive earnings growth in the next 
few quarters, as the company executes its on-going product mix improvement strategy.  We believe that Fairchild is well 
positioned  across  its  low  and  higher  power  business  segments  to  benefit  from  growth  in  key  end  markets. We  see 
company products levered to growth in handsets, smartphones, notebooks, servers, home appliances, digital television 
and automotive markets. In certain key markets, we expect the content opportunity to more than double over the next few 
years as the company targets an increasing portion of available content. From its position in high growth markets, we 
believe the company is driving a favorable mix shift toward more differentiated, high margin products. We believe that the 
greater than 1,000bps increase in gross margin over the last five years is evidence of the effectiveness of management's 
product strategy. We expect product momentum to continue driving further gross margin expansion for the company. 
Additionally, with what we think is an opportunity for growth in key end markets coupled with margin expansion, we expect 
Fairchild EPS to increase at least 12% annually in the next few years.

Our  price  target  of  $22  is  based  on  12x  our  CY12  EPS  forecast  of  $1.80,  a  slight  PEG  premium  of  1.0x  versus 
comparable 0.9x, which we believe is appropriate as it reflects what we view as superior growth and margin potential. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  key  risks  for  Fairchild  Semiconductor  include  the  following:  1)  The  market  for  power  semiconductors  is  highly 
competitive, and it faces competition from established companies 2) Given the high unit volume manufacturing intensity of 
the  power  semiconductor  market,  the  company  remains  exposed  to  pricing  pressure  if  unit  demand  weakens  and 
manufacturing utilization declines; 3) Execution risk remains as the company shifts its mix to higher margin analog and 
mixed-signal products where the company has not historically competed. 
 
 
Fortinet Inc.  (NASDAQ: FTNT, $26.86, Buy, Price Target: $29)  
Dan Cummins | 212-468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe Fortinets growth opportunity in network security and focused capabilities can enable the company to continue 
to competing favorably and expand  its addressable  markets over the next several  years. We expect Fortinet to take 
market share in the roughly $4 billion global market for unified threat management (UTM) and next-generation firewall and 
VPN  technologies.  We  believe  Fortinets  strategy  and  investment  opportunity  will  grow  to  include  larger  market 
opportunities beyond a current core UTM market. Despite rapid success in channel-driven UTM over the past ten years, 
the company has resisted temptation to dilute its focus and chase adjacent market opportunities. Now, as a scale leader 
in its core market, we believe Fortinet has options for new addressable markets, with notable early success (e.g. carrier-
level, global enterprise) and presence in Gbps-speed packet inspection appliances. In late April, Fortinet made a small, 
technology focused acquisition which we believe can improve the companys capabilities to protect voice-over-IP traffic, a 
strong growth category in data services.    
 
Valuation  
We base our $29 price target on a FCF per share multiple of 31x our revised FY12 FCF/share estimate of $0.95, in line 
with the current 31x based on our revised 2011E FCF estimate of $0.84. The security group peer median FCF multiple is 
currently  23x.  We  believe  investors  will  continue  to  pay  a  premium  multiple  for  the  company's  ability  to  potentially 
outperform estimates. Accordingly, we believe a 31x multiple is appropriate.     
 
Risks to Price Target   
Competitive   landscape   is  tough:  scale  and  specialist   vendors,   and  dynamic  technology.  Fortinet   competes   with 
significantly larger companies, including Cisco and others. HP and IBM also possess notable assets in networking security 
as a result of acquisitions, and can price aggressively in order to box out competitors, we believe. The overall UTM market 
is fragmented, with nearly 40% of revenue market share for unified threat management held by mostly private, subscale 
firms. Private competitors also compete aggressively with new technological approaches to networking security, and could 
soon prove to be as disruptive.

Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX, $29.65, Buy, Price Target: $36)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
Strong OEM endorsements from HPQ/ORCL and at least three new potential near-term revenue drivers: 1) new tier-1 
Storage  back-end  interconnects  expected  in  2H11;  2)  new  ORCL  clustered  appliances  targeting  Enterprise  Apps,  in 
addition to Exadata and Exalogic; 3) and HPQ's recent broadening of scope of HPC BU to include web2.0/Cloud verticals, 
strengthen our conviction in MLNX fundamentals. Additionally, given, in our view, its strong engineering talent base, its 
excellent execution capabilities and now its end-to-end product portfolio encompassing IB/ Ethernet and silicon/ adaptors/ 
switches, the company is likely to continue benefitting disproportionately from trends that are converging requirements in 
its historically strong HPC market and the Cloud. We believe MLNX's strength lies in its strong engineering talent base 
and its superior execution of its vision, which we believe are strong sustainable competitive advantages.    
 
Valuation  
Our price target for MLNX shares is $36, which is based on a 20x P/E multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.68 and 
$2.45 per share cash. We believe a 20x P/E multiple is appropriate as it reflects a PEG ratio of 1x on our assumption of 
an earnings growth rate of 20%. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Mellanox is a component supplier to powerful OEMs that enjoy pricing leverage and are likely to change order patterns 
rapidly, which may affect revenue visibility for MLNX. Although Mellanox has enjoyed a virtual monopoly in InfiniBand, 
serious competition in the form of QLogic has begun to emerge in the market. QLogic could potentially cause severe price 
competition in the future as it tries to gain market share from MLNX. With the acquisition of VOLT, the InfiniBand market 
has become a two-horse race, in our view. If OEMs determine that they need to dual source their InfiniBand adaptors, 
QLGC could gain significant share in the market.  Additionally, customer inertia may prevent InfiniBand from moving 
beyond its current niche of High Performance Computing. 
 
 
NetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP, $51.97, Buy, Price Target: $65)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
A strong storage-optimization based product positioning especially in virtual-server related storage deployments, ramping 
distribution and sales presence, and increasing penetration into the enterprise have, in our view, enabled NetApp to gain 
significant market share over the past year. We expect these growth-drivers to continue driving share gains for NetApp 
and solidify its recently-achieved No.2 position in the storage market. We are also encouraged by the upward reset in 
operating margin target from 16% to north of 18%. We also view the Engenio takeout as positive for NTAP given our belief 
that it fills a fairly large hole in NTAP's portfolio in terms of a high-performance controller-based storage system and 
inexpensive price. This signals a departure from NTAP's historical product strategy of leveraging "common-operating-
system-on-commodity-hardware" but in our view is a necessary step as NTAP expands beyond its core mid-range-storage 
segment into higher performance-sensitive workloads, we estimate an incremental $5B TAM by 2014. We expect NTAP to 
leverage its channel to drive strong revenue synergies for Engenio and NTAP's existing portfolio. We believe NTAP is 
likely to show significant operating leverage and exit FY11 with operating margins significantly higher than the targeted 
range.  We  believe  this  positions  the  company  to  report  results  ahead  of  current  consensus  estimates  in  upcoming 
quarters. Considering our belief that NTAP is strongly positioned in the strongest storage growth markets, is gaining 
significant share at scale and has seen a significant reset in its earning power, we believe there is material potential 
upside in NTAP stock at current levels.   
 
Valuation  
Our price target of $65 is based on an ex-cash 21x multiple to our CY12 EPS estimate of $2.70 and net cash per share of 
$8.58. This implies a PEG ratio of 1.05, assuming a long-term growth rate of 20%, which we believe is appropriate based 
on, in our view, superior positioning in the fastest growing mid-market storage segment.

Risks to Price Target   
NetApp is exposed to the global macroeconomic slowdown, as are all other storage majors. Given its broad storage 
product and  geographical  footprint,  NetApp is exposed to  the  global economic slowdown  as much as all other large 
storage system vendors. Historically, strong Financial Services concentration could be a source of revenue risk. NetApp 
has historically generated about 10-15% of its revenue from the Financial Services vertical. The company generates about 
40% of its revenues overseas and is, therefore, subject to above-average foreign currency risk. Competition is becoming 
more intense all the time. We believe that competition from the large system vendors is bound to increase in a downturn.   
 
 
OPNET Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPNT, $38.82, Buy, Price Target: $43)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We characterize OPNETs opportunity as enterprise ITs efforts upgrade application performance monitoring (APM), in 
order to meet the challenges of complexity and network diversity among a new generation of process-driven enterprise 
applications. We believe OPNET will continue to raise its competitive profile in strategic APM, while taking share from a 
range of larger incumbents. We expect OPNET to reap the benefits of recent and focused efforts to expand and improve 
the  capabilities  of  its  sales function,  in  order  to  match  up  with  OPNETs  native  depth  in  packet  network  design  and 
protocols, application troubleshooting, and in heterogeneous application architectures.    
 
Valuation   
Our $43 per-share price target is based on a P/FCF multiple of 27x based on our FY13E FCF estimate of $1.57 (+43% 
yr/yr). OPNT shares currently trade at 35x our FY12E FCF per share estimate of $1.10. We believe investors will continue 
to  pay  a  high  multiple  of  earnings  for  OPNT  shares  in  anticipation  of  strong  revenue  growth  and  margin  accretion. 
Accordingly, we believe a 27x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  Network  instrumentation  market  is  fragmented,  and  competition  amongst  existing  vendors  could  be  a  source  of 
margin compression. Large players could develop their own solutions and infringe upon OPNET's turf. OPNET occupies a 
niche in the broader Network Management space. The niche does not have a large vendor in this space. We believe that 
continued macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to a larger portion of deals getting consummated over longer cycles, 
hence, delaying revenue recognition. 
 
 
Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL, $32.60, Buy, Price Target: $40)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe Oracle today exerts greater global account control than ever, resulting in share gains of customers IT budgets 
and a stronger ability to enter new markets. Supplemented by its successful acquisition strategy, Oracle has attained the 
#1 market share position in both the database and middleware markets, and a #2 position in the application software 
market.  Because  this  stack  is  increasingly  based  on  industry  standards  for  programming  and  exposing  data,  the 
marketplace is gravitating toward Oracle's offerings over those of second-tier providers, in our view.  Additionally, ORCL 
has only reported a full-year EPS decline once in the last 12 years (and even then, only 4%), and we believe ORCL's 
earnings resiliency has improved, as recurring maintenance revenue comprises 50% of revenue, versus 37% in FY02, 
and Oracle is advantaged by greater economies of scale today. In our view, this earnings resiliency and earnings growth 
that are more attractive to that of the S&P 500 deserve a premium valuation rather than a discount or market-average 
valuation, and we believe this equilibrium will be restored over time.   
 
Valuation   
On a CY: 2011E P/E basis, ORCL trades at 14.5x our CY: 2011 estimate of $2.28, which is essentially in line with the 
S&P  500  group  average  of  14.0x.  Our  $40  price  target  for  ORCL  shares  is based  on  a  15x multiple  applied  to  our 
CY:2012 EPS estimate of $2.52/share + $1.87 net cash per share. We believe that ORCL maintains essentially a similar 
valuation multiple for its out-year and believe this multiple is appropriate since, historically, ORCL shares have traded at a

slight premium to the market, and we expect the shares to continue to trade at a multiple that is in line with the historical 
level. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks  to  our  price  target  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  1)  Prolonged  weakness  in  IT  spending;  2)  macroeconomic 
fluctuations;  3)  acquisition  integration  challenges;  4)  competition;  5)  departure  of  key  management  personnel  could 
impede our price target. 
 
 
QUALCOMM Inc.  (NASDAQ: QCOM, $56.52, Buy, Price Target: $75)  
Mark McKechnie | 415-249-1988 | mmckechnie@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We view QCOM as the best large-cap semi play on smart phones and tablets with longer-term EPS power in the $4.00-
plus range. Our positive stance on QCOM is based on strong positioning in smart phones, market expansion into tablets 
and PCs (Windows8 ARM), with chipset share gains at Apple (iPhone5) and Nokia (WindowsPhone7) providing potential 
upside to our forecasts.  While we view the broad PC and Handset industries as cyclical, we estimate 35-40% growth in 
the coveted "gap" between the two: smart phones and tablets. We expect QCOM to benefit from 1) higher chip content as 
processing power/connectivity increases across mobile devices and 2) better royalties as 3G/4G moves upstream into 
tablets. We forecast unit growth of approximately 20% for CY11 and 15% for CY12 for QCOM's CDMA/WCDMA/LTE 
handset markets in aggregate, with an incremental 5-10% upside from tablets.  Our $75 target is based on 22x our FY12 
EPS estimate and does not include $13.09 in net cash per share.  Accordingly, we continue to include QCOM on our 
Conviction list.   
 
Valuation   
Our QCOM $75 price target is based on 22x our FY12 (September) EPS estimate of $3.40 and does not include $13.09 
per share in net cash. We justify the multiple on 1) our view of QCOM's leading royalty and chip position in smart phones, 
2) what we see as near-term potential upside from increased chips share with the iPhone5 and NOK's WindowsPhone7, 
and 3) what we see as potential upside from SnapDragon tablet wins. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target include: 1) Slower-than-anticipated industry unit growth; 2) Faster erosion of handset average 
selling prices; 3) Increased chip competition; and 4) general compression of market multiples.    
 
 
RightNow Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: RNOW, $29.77, Buy, Price Target: $38)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our recent survey work indicates the marketplace momentum of replacing legacy, single-channel on premise Customer 
Experience  solutions  with  multi-channel  cloud  based  solutions  is  accelerating  compared  to  six  month  ago.  We  think 
RNOW will benefit disproportionately from this replacement cycle since RightNow Technologies is the farthest along in 
building an Enterprise-scale cloud-based Customer Experience suite of solutions for large B2C businesses, in our view.  
Additionally, RightNows business model is positively levered to the mobile tsunami trend due to its volume-based usage 
pricing  model.  These  strong  market  tailwinds  plus  reported  TTM  current  software  backlog  growth  of  27%  gives  us 
confidence that new business and cash flow trends are accelerating, and we maintain a positive bias to current consensus 
expectations.  We believe the shares could appreciate through either higher estimate revisions or multiple expansion as 
the current discount valuation to the SaaS group average narrows over time.    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 price target is based on approximately 27x our EV/2012E OCF of $48M (cash from operations), which is a slight 
discount to the current average SaaS companies' EV/FTM OCF estimated multiple of 29. We use a 27 multiple to derive 
our price target, as we expect the shares to trade at a multiple that is essentially in line with the SaaS group average.

Riverbed Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: RVBD, $40.17, Buy, Price Target: $48)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are impressed by the company's material beat despite significant concerns related to Japan and US Federal markets. 
While these concerns are likely to persist into 2QFY11, we expect RVBD's momentum in other markets to offset any 
weakness in Japan and US Federal. Our checks suggest a strong pipeline for RVBD's core WAN optimization solution, 
ramping cross-sell opportunities for Network Monitoring solutions, and nascent interest in new Cloud offerings. We are 
also  encouraged  by  our  checks  in  Europe,  which  suggest  strong  momentum  for  RVBD  despite  likely  recent  sales 
leadership changes. While we believe consolidation of infrastructure within and across datacenters and branch offices is a 
strong secular trend that is likely to continue driving RVBD's core WAN optimization market, we believe the compelling 
economics of Cloud Backup Storage could potentially see broader adoption begin in CY11, which could cause another leg 
of growth for RVBD in the near future.     
 
Valuation  
We base our $48 price target on a P/E of 37.5x (ex cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.20 and a PEG ratio of 1.25. 
This is a premium multiple given our long-term earnings growth rate assumption of 30%, and we assume a PEG greater 
than 1 to reflect the company's leadership position in a high growth and what we believe is an underpenetrated market 
opportunity. Accordingly, we believe a premium multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
Larger vendors with greater access to resources may compete more vigorously than we expect. Larger vendors may 
develop  competing  products  or  acquire  the  remaining  private  vendors,  thus  becoming  a  greater  threat  to  Riverbed's 
market leadership. Riverbed may hire new employees more aggressively than we anticipate, thus limiting the operating 
margin and EPS potential. 
 
 
Spansion, Inc. (NYSE: CODE, $19.31, Buy, Price Target: $25)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis    
We   view   Spansion   as   the   leader   in   the   embedded   NOR  flash   memory  market   for   diversified   end   markets   in 
industrial/automotive,  telecom/networking,  computing  and  consumer  electronics.  Since  emerging  from  bankruptcy,  we 
believe that Spansion has executed well in regaining share in the embedded flash market with consistent revenue growth, 
higher margins, and free cash flow using its proprietary MirrorBit flash memory technology and a "FabLite" manufacturing 
strategy. Spansion has what we view as: a diversified customer base of over 4,000 global customers, good design win 
momentum, a focused new management team, a flexible Fab Lite manufacturing strategy and recent strong revenue and 
earnings growth.   
 
Valuation   
Our $25 price target is based on an approximate 11x P/E on our calendar 2011E pro forma EPS of $2.30 relative to our 
outlook for 12% secular earnings growth. Given the consolidation in the NOR industry likely leading to more stable pricing 
with Spansion and Micron technology being the two main competitors in the high-performance embedded NOR flash 
market, strong demand drivers currently in the embedded NOR market, technology leadership, and good management 
execution,  we  believe  that  a  forward  multiple  of  11x  on  our  calendar  2011E  EPS  is  justified  relative  to  Spansion's 
expected secular earnings growth outlook.

Risks to Price Target  
The  following  risks  are  inherent  to  investing  in  Spansion:  general  business  and  economic  conditions;  demand  for 
products; changes in customer order patterns; the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks. In addition, Spansion's recent emergence from Chapter 11 implies that 
the company has to re-engage and win back new and existing customers who may not have a business relationship. 
Spansion also has to rapidly transition to a "Fab Lite" flexible, manufacturing strategy of using its captive Fab in Austin, 
coupled with foundries such as Elpida, SMIC etc. Additionally, Spansion still has significant debt load which may constrain 
its operational flexibility; especially in weak economic times.     
 
 
Ultra Clean Holdings Inc.  (NASDAQ: UCTT, $8.38, Buy, Price Target: $20)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis    
We believe Ultra Clean Holdings is well-positioned for long-term growth as a leading provider of gas delivery systems and 
outsourced  manufacturing  of  larger  subsystems  for  the  semiconductor,  flat  panel,  solar/LED,  medical,  and  research 
capital equipment industry. UCTT has a history of consistent growth and profitability. Key factors for potential growth in 
our view include higher-level subsystems outsourced manufacturing, diversification into related markets, and a focus on 
expansion in Asia. Ultra Clean has a blue-chip list of customers in our view, within the semiconductor capital equipment 
industry.  In  addition,  the  company  is  diversifying  into  non-semiconductor  capital  equipment  manufacturing,  flat  panel 
displays, and medical robotics equipment.  
 
Valuation   
Our price target of $20 is based on a 13x P/E on our estimated CY12 EPS of $1.55 relative to our outlook for 15% secular 
earnings growth (87% PEG). We believe that a conservative PEG ratio of 87% is appropriate for a cyclical outsourced 
manufacturing  services  company  such  as  UCTT,  which  has  a  relatively  concentrated  customer  base,  prospects  for 
moderate revenue growth of 10% to 15% per year, and limited long-term visibility on orders and business trends, in our 
view. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks  to  our  UCTT  price  target  include  the  cyclical  outsourced  manufacturing  services  strategy  with  a  relatively 
concentrated  customer  base,  prospects  for  moderate  revenue  growth  of  10  to  15%  per  year,  and  limited  long-term 
visibility on orders and business trends. The following risks are inherent in a diversified semiconductor company: general 
business and economic conditions; demand for products; customer concentration, changes in customer order patterns; 
changes in outsourced manufacturing strategy, the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks.

Active Network Inc. (NYSE: ACTV, $18.58, Buy, Price Target: $23)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Active is a leading provider of cloud-based reservation and marketing solutions serving a variety of customer groups, 
including  business  events,  community  activities,  outdoors,  and  sports.  Our  Buy  rating  is  based  on:  1)  strong  growth 
potential  in  an  underpenetrated  $10B  North  American  technology  fee  opportunity,  2)  Active  provides  a  strong  value 
proposition to both organizations and consumers, 3) numerous growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term 
growth, and 4) attractive financial characteristics with highly predictable revenues and high incremental EBITDA margins.  
Accordingly, we add ACTV to our Conviction Buy list.   
 
Valuation   
We arrive at a $23 per-share price target for Active based on 26x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $53.5M. We believe a 26x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35% plus long-term EBITDA growth, and 30% and 63% EBITDA growth in 2011 and 
2012. Our price target also equates to 22x our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $75.7M, discounted back to 2012 at 12%.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks for Active Network include risks of integrating acquisitions; competition; slower adoption of web-based reservation 
systems; the macroeconomic environment; transition to the ActiveWorks platform; expansion into new businesses and 
risks surrounding International expansion.   
 
 
Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU, $138.94, Buy, Price Target: $175)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
We  remain  positive  on  BIDU  shares,  and  expect  continued  strong  growth  driven  by  1)  continued  consumer  Internet 
adoption  we expect China to add another 70 million Internet users in 2011 up from approximately 450M at the end of 
2010 (33% online penetration); 2) continued merchant adoption  we estimate Baidu has approximately 5% market share 
among  its  addressable  market  of  5 million  larger  SMEs  in  China;  3)  strong  growth  in  emerging  categories  including 
eCommerce; 4) continued monetization improvements. We believe these factors should lead to 60% plus top-line growth 
in 2011 and we expect continued strong incremental margins which we expect to lead to 70% plus EPS growth.    
 
Valuation   
Our $175 price target for BIDU shares is based on a 45x P/E to our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $3.88. We believe a 45x 
multiple is justified given our outlook for 40%-plus long-term EPS growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Key risks for Baidu include an economic slowdown in China, increased regulatory action, increased competition, and lack 
of a developed eCommerce market.    
 
 
comScore Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR, $26.45, Buy, Price Target: $36)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
comScore  is  a  leading  provider  of  audience  measurement  tools  and  related  marketing  intelligence,  in  our  view.  The 
company offers its products and solutions to agencies, marketers, and online publishers via a combination of subscription 
products (~85% of total revenue; subscription services are sold on annual basis and retention rates have historically 
exceeded  90%) and customized,  project-based engagements (~15% of revenue). Over the past  year, comScore has 
demonstrated  significant  Y/Y  growth  acceleration  in  net  customer  additions  (a  key  indicator  of  the  companys  future 
revenue prospects), driven by an improving ad spending environment and strong demand for the companys enhanced 

                                                                                                                         
 

                                                                                                              Page 11

                                                                                                        July 13, 2011  
                                                                                                  Industry Report       

                                                   
 
audience  measurement  technology,  Media  Metrix  360,  based  on  a  hybrid  panel-and-census  measurement  approach. 
While  we  expect  continued  strong  net  customer  additions  in  2011,  we  believe  that  the  key  driver  for  comScores 
fundamentals and stock performance over the next 6-12 months will be growth in revenue per customer, which we expect 
to be driven by generally deepening engagement with customers, and particularly by increasing traction for the companys 
Digital  Analytix  Web  analytics  suite  and  the  companys  ad  effectiveness  measurement  solutions.  We  believe  that  a 
significant  acceleration  in  project  revenue  growth  witnessed  beginning  in  3Q10  is  an  early  indication  of  a  trend  of 
increasing ARPU which we expect to continue through 2011. Heading into 2012, we expect the companys continuing 
development of its new product pipeline to serve as a further catalyst for company fundamentals. Based on these key 
catalysts, we believe the company is likely to generally outperform consensus expectations, drive increased operating 
leverage into 2012, and garner an expanding valuation multiple over the next 12-24 months. 
 
Valuation   
Our $36 price target is based on 14x our FY12 EBITDA estimate of $74.5M. We believe 14x FY12 EBITDA represents an 
appropriate discount to SaaS peers, given SCOR's exposure to risks associated with the advertising market and the 
broader consumer economy.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential  risks  include  customer  concentration,  competition,  or  potential  long-term  changes  in  media-buying  behavior 
(e.g., the shift to user-targeted online advertising), among others.   
 
 
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY, $32.26, Buy, Price Target: $38)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe factors that could lead to outperformance for eBay shares include continued improved performance of the U.S. 
Marketplace  and  strong  growth  for  PayPal.  We  expect  the  Marketplace  business  to  benefit  from  an  anticipated 
continuation of an improved user experience, growth from larger and top-rated sellers, and an increased mix of fixed price 
sales and stable auction sales. We note that ChannelAdvisor also recently indicated eBay's April marketplace growth of 
10.9%  (up  from  4.9%  in  1Q)  and  we  note  eBay  is  benefiting  from  a  higher  mix  of  fixed  price  sales,  improved  user 
experience  such  as  Parts  &  Accessories,  and  strength  from  larger  merchants.  For  2011,  we  estimate  U.S.  GMV  to 
accelerate to 9% Y/Y vs. 4% Y/Y in 2010.  We expect Payments growth to remain robust in 2011 driven by increasing 
penetration on eBay, continued robust Merchant Services growth driven by global expansion and increased merchant 
share, growth of PayPal for digital goods platform, and 4) growth of mobile payments  PayPal expects to triple mobile 
TPV from $750M in 2010 to over $2B in 2011.  We estimate 26% Y/Y Payments revenue growth for 2011 (low 20's FX 
neutral).    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 EBAY price target is based on approximately 14.4x our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $2.24 plus cash, which we 
believe is appropriate given our outlook of 5-10% long-term growth for the marketplace business and 15-20% long-term 
growth for the payment business. For our price target, we apply a 12x multiple to Marketplace 2012E PF EPS, a 20x 
multiple to Payments 2012E EPS, and add $6 in cash/investments, which equates to our $38 PT. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Key risks for eBay include competition, adverse currency movements, inability to improve eBay's user experience, and 
economic weakness.

Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS, $24.17, Buy, Price Target: $28)    
Atul Bagga | 415-249-6362 | abagga@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are positive on ERTS's proposed acquisition of PopCap, given growth in social and smartphone games that was faster 
than  we  had  expected;  better  than  we  expected  EPS  accretion  from  the  deal;  the  quality  of  PopCap  assets;  and  a 
potential to accelerate growth in higher-quality Games-as-a-Service business.  We are raising our estimates and  now 
expect EPS growth at 21% Y/Y and 39% Y/Y EPS during FY12 and FY13 respectively, driven largely by growing revenue 
contribution from relatively lucrative Games-as-a-Service segment. 
 
Valuation 
Our $28 price target on ERTS shares is based on a 26x PE (net of cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.82 versus a 13x 
average  for  the  shares  of  the  peer  group. We  think  that  the  premium  is  appropriate,  given  that  we  believe  that  the 
company  has strong franchises and the  potential to monetize these franchises on emerging platforms and given the 
company's focus on the faster-growing Games-as-a-Service segment.    
 
Risks to Price Target 
Gaming  continues  to  be  a  hit-or-miss-driven  business,  and  predicting  successful  titles  versus  unsuccessful  titles  is 
extremely difficult. The risk is especially high for the new and unproven IPs, and a company's reliance on the new IPs and 
the titles in the established franchises to reach the revenue target opens it to risk of a revenue miss. Additionally, we 
believe there are macro headwinds given the increasing popularity of the used games and free-to-play online games.   
 
 
Velti PLC (NASDAQ: VELT, $18.70, Buy, Price Target: $22)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Velti is, in our view, a leading provider of mobile marketing and mobile advertising technology solutions. We believe the 
company is well positioned to benefit from rapid growth in demand for mobile marketing/advertising in the coming years, 
which  we  believe  should  drive  complementary  demand  for  technology  solutions  which  make  mobile  marketing  and 
advertising  campaigns  more  targetable,  effective,  and  accountable.  While  we  expect  the  companys  core  market 
opportunity to grow at a 30%+ CAGR over the next five years, we believe that Velti could grow even faster, based on: 1) a 
focus on marketing solutionswe believe the company faces a richer and less competitive opportunity than peers focused 
solely on mobile advertising; 2) a flexible business model and end-to-end technology platform that allow the company to 
align  incentives  with  customers  and  provide  seamless  solutions  to  address  marketers  needs  across  the  consumer 
lifecycle; and 3) a strong management team and reputation in the marketplace. Regarding the potential performance of 
VELT shares, we note that 1) we have a high degree of confidence in the companys fundamental performance; 2) the 
company represents a unique asset in the public markets in our view; 3) we believe the company could become a takeout 
candidate, based on the historical record of M&A activity in the space; and 4) shares appear to us to be attractively valued 
at approximately 11x FY12E EV/EBITDA.   
 
Valuation 
We note that shares of interactive marketing services peers currently trade at an average FY11E EV/EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 10x, while SaaS companies currently trade at an average of 23x FY11E EV/EBITDA. Given the company's 
growing SaaS revenue streams and what we view as its superior growth and long-term margin prospects, we believe 
VELT shares should trade toward the higher end of the 10-23x range. Accordingly, we apply a 20x multiple against or 
2011E EBITDA estimate of $54.1M to derive our $22 12-month price target.   
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target  include the  very early stage of development of the mobile marketing/advertising technology 
opportunity, customer/category concentration, geographic risk, ongoing development of internal controls, working capital 
requirements, competition, and the high degree of seasonality present in the business.

WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ: WBMD, $47.00, Buy, Price Target: $66)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We remain positive on WBMD shares, and expect another solid year of growth for WebMD in 2011 driven by 1) continued 
online migration of health related advertising  we estimate only mid-single digit online share today for the healthcare 
vertical; 2) continued consumer adoption health related web information which we believe should drive solid page view 
growth of approximately 15% in 2011; 3) continued operating leverage  we expect 53% incremental EBITDA margins in 
2011.  We believe these factors should lead to 17% plus top-line growth in 2011 and 28% plus EBITDA growth.    
 
Valuation 
Our $66 price target is based on a 12x multiple of our 2012E EBITDA of $279M plus net cash and investments and 
present value of NOLs. Historically, shares of Internet companies with similar business models, growth rates, and cash 
flow characteristics to WebMD have traded in the 10-15x forward-year EBITDA forecast range. Given those comparisons 
as a backdrop, we believe that our use of an EV/EBITDA multiple of 12xnear the mid point of the rangeis appropriate, 
given the company's solid fundamentals and what we view as its "premier" status among Internet publishers. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks include deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook, weakening of the advertising market, market share shift to 
lower-priced  online  advertising  alternatives  (e.g.,  health-oriented  vertical  advertising  and  content  networks),  and  the 
potential  for  incremental  regulation  further  limiting  the  ability  of  pharmaceutical  companies  to  market  directly  to 
consumers, among others.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY, $9.75, Buy, Price Target: $18)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
ALNY presented what we view as encouraging ALN-VSP01 data at ASCO and will seek a development partner prior to 
initiating Phase 2 trials. For the remainder of 2011, we believe additional important catalysts will include clinical data for 
ALN-TTR (3Q11), and ALN-PCS (4Q11). We believe investors could benefit from potential 2011 drivers in the context of a 
marginal cash burn (we estimate at $1.26 per share). We reiterate our Buy rating and $18 price target.    
 
2H11 Drivers: We believe the next two years (and especially 2H11) will show two additional important pipeline proof of 
concept (POC) data sets that we expect could drive shares significantly from current levels. In 3Q11, ALNY plans to 
announce Phase 1 POC data for ALN-TTR01 in TTR Amyloidosis. The trial's primary goal is to evaluate safety, but it also 
includes secondary end points the Street should find meaningful, such as ALN-TTR treatment's effect on circulating TTR 
plasma levels measured as percentage (%) lowering of TTR from pretreatment/baseline TTR levels. Our TTR consultants 
would be encouraged to observe 10-20% plasma TTR reductions while they believe up to 50% is also possible in this trial. 
They generally believe a 50% plasma TTR reduction is enough to cause TTR plaque regression or slow progression of 
the disease by 50% (factor of 2). By YE11, we believe ALN-PCS data for hypercholesterolemia patients should become 
available. ALNY has not yet specified the end points for this trial, but we believe it is also committed to measuring efficacy 
in a manner that would be appreciated by the Street. In 2011, ALNY further plans to disclose two additional pipeline 
programs. In 2012, ALNY plans to enter ALN-ALN-HTT for Huntington's Disease and ALN-HPN for refractory anemia into 
the clinic.    
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $18 is based on a sum-of-parts analysis by estimating YE11 cash (12-month forward) at 
approximately $8-9 per share and adding $9 per share ($410M) in pipeline technology value. Risks include IP litigation; 
delivery failures; clinical, regulatory, and competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and extended timelines to potential 
profitability.

Risks to Price Target  
ALNYs  lead  product  candidates  appear  to  be  at  least  a  few  years  from  market  and  may  face  significant  clinical, 
regulatory, and competitive risks. Additionally, IP litigation and failure to make advances in RNAi delivery could lead to 
extended timelines to potential profitability. We also anticipate significant changes to the marketplace as new medicines 
are  introduced.  To  reiterate,  primary  investment  risks  include  IP  litigation;  delivery  failures;  clinical,  regulatory,  and 
competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and future financing risk. 
 
 
Dendreon Corp. (NASDAQ: DNDN, $38.49, Buy, Price Target: $55)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our 40 U.S. physician survey provides a foundation for our Provenge near term launch expectations and longer term peak 
sales potential by scenario analysis of the potential impact of Abiraterone and MDV-3100. Our most conservative scenario 
relative to Provenge leads us to a $50 12-month price target. Less conservative scenarios lead to a price target as high as 
$67. If the 2011 Provenge sales ramp falls short of Street expectations, we would take advantage of any weakness as our 
longer term robust survey-predicted peak sales estimate provides downside protection, in our view.    
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $55 is based on a discounted EPS valuation analysis. Our $55 PT is based on 25x our fully 
taxed/diluted FY14 EPS estimate of $3.85 discounted annually back to mid-2012 at 25%. Our PE multiple is in line with 
shares of high-growth biotechnology companies, and we believe the discount rate is appropriate for a company with late-
stage therapeutic candidates for orphan indication.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Central to our thesis and current valuation is DNDN's execution related to ramping up Provenge sales. Near term, there is 
risk  of  DNDN  successfully  training  additional  physicians  on  use  and  treatment  of  Provenge,  increase  manufacturing 
capacity including regulatory plant approvals, streamline reimbursement and physician education related to Provenge. 
Longer term, DNDN will need to successfully mitigate E.U. manufacturing facility build out, regulatory challenges and 
launch of the drug. Over the next 12 months, we foresee the major near-term risk in DNDN relating to it achieving its 2011 
Provenge revenue guidance, with near 50% of those revenues expected in 4Q11. We do not expect reporting of these 
Provenge revenues until early 2012, either at an investor conference or quarterly earnings call.    
 
 
NuVasive Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA, $32.18, Buy, Price Target: $39)    
Sameer Harish | 415-249-1989 | sharish@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We  expect  NuVasive  to  benefit  from  the  increased  interest  in  minimally  invasive  and  lateral  spine  surgery  and  to 
increasingly promote their nerve monitoring system, advanced retractors, and market leading suite of lateral implants. A 
significant part of NuVasive's growth and margin strategy circles around sales force leverage, we believe. Over half of the 
sales reps have been with NuVasive for less than two years and are just starting to reach their target productivity. Further, 
we  expect  NuVasive  to  focus  on  advanced  physician  training  to  expand  utilization  and  procedure  breadth  amongst 
surgeons to take advantage of newly introduced products such as XLIF Thoracic, NuVasive TLIF, and procedures using 
multi-level constructs. Operating leverage will also be driven by sale force maturation, as well as an expanding product 
offering, and fixed cost  efficiencies,  in  our  view. Thus we expect Street  estimates for NUVA  will  increase over time. 
Notably,  the  company  recently  increased  guidance  for  2011  citing  improved  visibility  and  physician  reimbursement 
conversion rates for cases under appeal, all contribution to a stronger U.S. lumbar outlook. We also expect NuVasive to 
launch several new products in the near-to-mid term. NuVasive is developing disc replacement devices including the PCM 
cervical disc system, XL total disc replacement (TDR), and NeoDisc cervical disc replacement device. Progentix is a new 
synthetic biologic that we expect to gain FDA approval during 2011. We believe NuVasive will maintain a sustainable 
competitive advantage for growth with its proprietary technologies, and strong pipeline products.

Valuation   
Our $39 price target is based upon 3x our 2012 revenue estimate of $602.9 million. This is a discount to the comparable 
medtech companies' averages of 3.8x 2012 revenues. NuVasive shares are trading at 1.8x our 2012 revenues and 2.1x 
our 2011 revenues of $532.8 million, compared to the medtech companies'' average of 3.9x 2011 revenues. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
NuVasive   operates   in   a   highly   competitive   and   dynamic   industrynew   technology   and   innovation   from   other 
organizations  may  change  NuVasives  ability  to  successfully  grow  in  their  markets  and  may  make  the  companys 
technology  obsolete. Additional  near-term risks include pricing  or reimbursement pressures, slowing market for spine 
surgery, timing and/or loss of orders to large hospital or physician groups, clinical guideline changes, delays in regulatory 
filings and supply and manufacturing disruptions.

Ceradyne Inc.  (NASDAQ: CRDN, $36.21, Buy, Price Target: $60)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe CRDN is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward increased applications of advanced 
ceramics in the industrial and energy market due to lightweight, heat, and wear advantages versus incumbent materials. 
Near term, we believe the company is getting better yield on its military business as it more effectively meets product 
specs. Second, the company is getting better utilization of its manufacturing assets having closed two facilities in 2010 
and getting better utilization as revenue increases. Third, the company's mix of products is migrating to higher margin 
opportunities in solar and industrial applications. We believe these three drivers will remain intact going forward. We are 
also encouraged by the company's investment in additional Boron separation capacity this year along with the accelerated 
traction of its Petrochem and bioglass products. We believe CRDN's improving product mix and end-market exposure are 
sufficient to drive material growth over the next several years.    
 
Valuation 
We give shares of CRDN a Buy rating and a price target of $60, based on 8x our EV/2012E EBITDA of $171M, in line with 
peers now that the company has realized its margin expansion potential. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
1) Defense Demand Risk; 2) Non-Defense Demand Risk; 3) Operational Risk; 4) Competition Risk; 5) Foreign Market 
Risk. 
 
 
Johnson Controls Inc.  (NYSE: JCI, $41.14, Buy, Price Target: $49)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We  continue  to  highlight  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  Cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification  of  the  transportation  market.  We  continue  to  believe  the  company's  Power  Solutions  and  Automotive 
Experience segments are positioned for improvement. We also continue to believe that the company is well positioned to 
benefit from multi-year revenue and margin growth in its Building Efficiency segment. In addition, we note that JCI's entry 
into the demand response (DR) market signals that the DR market is a large enough addressable opportunity to warrant 
investment and that the economics of DR contracts are likely to change substantially over time and move more toward 
commodity pricing. We believe that JCI's entry into the DR market may be driven in part by a desire to retain customers. 
We also note interest from global energy regulators. In the United States, we note that FERC's Order 745 sets up a 
framework for DR providers to receive Locational Marginal Pricing, while the TVA's recent Integrated Resource Plan has 
increased focus on Energy Efficiency and DR. The European Energy Commission's recent communication on its 2011

Energy Efficiency Plan states continued focus on Building Efficiency improvements. We also note statements from various 
news sources that Germany plans to increase its focus on Offshore Wind and Building Efficiency.   
 
Valuation  
We give shares of JCI a Buy rating and price target of $49, based on 15x our FY2012E EPS estimate of $3.27, a modest 
premium to diversified industrial peers due to our expectation for JCI to grow faster than peers. JCI is at a slight premium 
to shares of diversified industrial peers due to its exposure to strong growth markets and positive product mix shift, in our 
opinion.  We  also  view  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification of the transportation market.

Rogers Corp. (NYSE: ROG, $46.90, Buy, Price Target: $64)    
Shawn Severson | 415-249-1986 | sseverson@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We are of the belief that Rogers is only in the early stages of a multi-year growth story built on key applications in the 
cleantech,  Internet  and  mass  transit  markets.  We  think  many  of  the  company's  products  are  high  value  added 
components, yet account for a relatively small portion of the bill of materials. This is a very important distinction as it can 
provide some price protection and insulation from competition as commercial volumes scale in markets such as electric 
vehicles  and  smart  phones/tablets,  in  our  view.  We  think  the  current  valuation  provides  a  significant  opportunity  for 
investors to build a position and we expect multiple expansion and solid earnings growth to prevail over the coming 12 
months.   
 
Valuation  
Our price target for ROG shares is $64, based on a PE of 18x our FY12 EPS estimate of $3.43. Our target multiple is in 
line with the shares' average valuation since 2005. We believe the multiple expansion from the current level will be driven 
by investors recognizing what we view as strong secular megatrends developing for the company and the potential effect 
on earnings over the next three years. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Although we believe the company is likely to benefit from positive megatrends, the company is still likely to be sensitive to 
broader  economic  conditions.  As  was  displayed  clearly  during  the  financial  crisis  and  subsequent  recession,  ROG's 
products and, hence, revenues are subject to cyclical trends. As we have stated previously, we believe ROG has solid 
growth  opportunities in some key sectors, but this  would not be enough to offset a meaningful decline in the  global 
economy. Failure of key growth markets to materialize. Our investment thesis is dependent a couple key markets and any 
significant or permanent disruption in those markets could have a sustained negative effect on the shares. Specifically, the 
prospects for 4G deployment, rail infrastructure in developing countries, and the adoption rate of HEV/EV around the 
world.

CONSUMER  
 
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST, $80.71, Buy, Price Target: $90)  
Edward Weller | 415 249 1377 | eweller@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
With high gas prices and food inflation both intensifying the consumers usual quest for value, the combination of Costcos 
always  extremely  aggressive  pricing  and  what  appears  to  be  improving  customer  service  seem  to  us  to  be  driving 
increased frequency among existing members and new customer sign-ups, as well. Comp store customer traffic has been 
rising by 4% month after month for more than two years now and we believe that customers will continue to favor Costco 
for more of their purchases. Whats more, international operations (ex the UK business) seems to be firing on all cylinders 
and   an   incipient   recovery   in   Southern   California,   historically   Costcos   most   profitable   regions,   can   have   a 
disproportionately favorable impact on profitability for the next couple of years. We expect that ROIs will continue to rise, 
that  Costco  will  increase  its  growth  rate  and,  by  putting  more  capital  to  work  at  those  high  ROIs,  drive  increasing 
shareholder value. We reiterate our Buy on Costco.   
 
Valuation  
The rising valuations that we foresee in coming years derive directly from this recovery to normal  or recently normal  
returns, and those rising returns should drive richer valuations in our view. These generally rising returns, in combination 
with our estimates of slowly rising company investment suggest a price target a year from now of $90. (See our extensive 
valuation methodology in our report entitled  COST: Closes Quarter Strong, Recovery Still Building in Southern California , 
             th
dated May 18  , 2011.     
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential risks to our forecasts and to our estimates and price target for Costco include: yet a further general economic 
slowdown  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  or  other  region  important  to  the  company;  interruptions  in  merchandise 
availability; continued upward pressure on operating expenses; and greater-than-anticipated competitive pressures.
