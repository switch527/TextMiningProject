                                       •  2011 guidance commentary:  Management guided 2011 revenues to be $150-175MM 
                                          (+40-50% y/y), and noted that Development Services will have the same run rate as 4Q 
                                          while Powertrain revenues will be roughly flat with 2010; we estimate this implies a 
                                          +10-15% increase in Roadster unit volumes in 2011. Gross margins in 2011 could be 
                                          below 4Q (31.2%), largely a function of revenue mix. Development Services carry a 
                                          high 50-70% gross margin, whereas Roadster and Powertrain have similar gross 
                                          margins of ~20%. Further, SG&A and R&D are expected to moderately increase from 
                                          Q4 run rate. Similarly, management guided 2011 capex to be in the range of $190-
                                          215MM, slightly higher than what we would have expected, likely explained by: a) 
                                          incremental insourcing (i.e., stampings and plastics); b) newer technology in paint/body 
                                          shop; c) more automation to produce 3,000 units in single shift (earlier plant required 2 
                                          shifts), and d) under-running of capex  in 2010 ($105MM vs. $100-125MM guidance). 
                                          We note that this years capex will be largely funded by TSLAs DoE loan. 

                                       •  4Q:10 details: Roadster volumes declined slightly q/q to 149 units (vs. 151 units in 
                                          3Q:10), likely due to seasonal reasons. Roadster ASP, however, grew sequentially and 
                                          the increase was attributed to: higher Asian mix, higher option take rates in Europe, and 
                                          favorable foreign exchange. Gross margins improved to 31.2% in 4Q (vs. 29.8% in 3Q) 
                                          due to lower labor and overhead costs. R&D expenditure spiked up to $38MM (vs. 
                                          $27MM in 3Q) on account of building the alpha version of Model S, relocation of 
                                          employees from Los Angeles to Palo Alto, and higher headcount. 

                                       •  Expansion in Chinese market:  TSLA mentioned that it will enter the China market in 
                                          2013, at the earliest, as an anticipated strong demand for Model S in existing markets, 
                                          which should outpace production in 2012, would make entry into new markets less 
                                          attractive phenomena in the 2012 time frame. Further, mgmt. stated that it will not 
                                          make significant modifications to Model S for Chinese market consumption, a strategy 
                                          similar to the one used by German luxury OEMs. Also, TSLA is not looking for any 
                                          partner with which to penetrate the Chinese market.

                                      Valuation 
                                      We derive our $30 Dec-11 price target using DCF analysis (11.5% discount rate, 4% 
                                      terminal growth, exclusive of 2011 burn).  Our price target reflects a price/sales 
                                      multiple of 1.4x, which is in line with the 1.5x average 2012E p/sales of A123, 
                                      Ener1, BYD, discounted one year as we apply it to Teslas 2013 sales. However, our 
                                      $30 target does imply a somewhat lofty 27x P/E on tax rate-adjusted 2013E EPS 
                                      (versus its current multiple of 21x), although implied P/E is 17.1x if 10% EBIT 
                                      margin is used (our margin forecast may be conservative at least in the initial years 
                                      [guidance is 14-16%]). Since its 2003 start, Tesla has been singularly focused on 
                                      developing pure electric vehicles (EVs). We think EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) 
                                      both hold strong long-term promise given tightening environmental regulations and 
                                      an increasingly green global consumer. Maintain Overweight.  

                                      Risks to Price Target and Rating 
                                      Downside risks: (1) Established luxury carmakers introduce competing vehicles that 
                                      eventually prove performance and cost competitive to Teslas technology. Audi, for 
                                      example, is targeting a 2012 launch of its E-tron EV ultra luxury sports car, and 
                                      Mercedes and Porsche have pure EV sports car plans in the works as well. (2) The 
                                      manufacturing ramp of Model S is delayed notably. (3) Model S sales start 
                                      cannibalizing Roadster sales. (4) Elon Musk (CEO) is a key executive whose loss to 
                                      the company could potentially be fairly detrimental (he has a history of moving on 
                                      once companies become successful). We see him as a visionary who drives Tesla to 
                                      high technical and commercial targets. 

                                                                                                                         3 

                                                                                                                              221

Initiated coverage Aug 09, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying
