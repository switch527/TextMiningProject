      The Alpha prototype build was completed in  April, approximately 15 months from

      this is on, if not ahead of, schedule.  We continue to view the significant amount                Market Cap (USDm)                                                           2,550.8

      we are comfortable that they have the pers onnel in place to garner success.  And                 Option volume (und. shrs., 1M avg.)         
      the order book is strong for the vehicle,  as reservations (minimum $5,000 deposit               
      required) are 4,600 (up from 3,400 at 12/31/10) which is not far from the 6,500 
      units we expect to be produced in 2012. 
      Some encouraging comments on key variables to long-term earnings 
      Warranty: Management commented that Roadster warranty spending has 
      remained stable as the vehicle has aged.  Additionally, Roadster batteries have 
      continued to perform well, even at 100k miles.  Leasing:  The luxury sedan 
      segment can have 50%+ leasing penetration, so it is important for Tesla to have 
      an externally-financed leasing program.  Management commented that they are in 
      discussions with several banks on this matter, although Tesla will likely have to 
      share some level of vehicle residual risk (at least initially).  International Sales:  
      More than 50% of 1Q11 Roadster sales occurred outside the U.S.  Our Model S 
      forecast includes an assumption that 50% are sold outside the U.S., which could 
      be particularly beneficial in a weak-dollar environment.   

      Raising target to $24 from $21.50 on adjd long-term USD / EUR assumption  
      We adjusted to $1.30 USD / EUR from $1.  20.  Every $0.10 change is a ~$3.00 
      impact to our target price, which is based on a long-term DCF analysis.  Key 
      downside risks include execution on             the scale up from niche to volume 
      manufacturing and demand / avg trans price assumptions. Upside could be 
      derived from higher-than-expected Model S volumes.

4 May 2011       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                              

                                Tesla reported adjusted EPS of -$0.44 vs consensus and DB est of -$0.52.  EBIT of -$41.4MM 
                                compared to our -$48.9MM estimate, as powert rain revenue was better-than-expected and 
                                gross margin (37.1%, +550bp sequentially) ben efited from a 74% margin on Development 
                                Services revenue (i.e. prototype batteries).   Revenue guidance of $170MM-$185MM implies 
                                a sequential reduction from 1Q11 revenue of $49 MM, but this is to be expected as Daimler / 
                                Smart battery production winds down from current levels.  Assuming Tesla gets a production 
                                contract for the 2012 Toyota RAV4 program, th  is should more than offset the loss of the 
                                Daimler programs, and there is certainly the possi bility that Tesla receives additional Daimler 
                                business for 2012.  All in all, Tesla co     ntinues to execute well on current revenue 
                                opportunities.  Weve been encouraged that  Roadster volumes and gross margins have been 
                                stable, despite the Model S launch being just more than one year away.  Total cash levels 
                                (including restricted cash) ended the quarter at $148.5MM, down $29.5MM.  We continue to 
                                believe (and the company reiterated) that cash  levels are sufficient to bridge the company to 
                                cash flow positive, which we expect in early 2013. 

                                The company appears to be well on-track for an  on-time Model S launch in mid-2012.  The 
                                Alpha prototype build was completed in April,  approximately 15 months from launch.  Based 
                                on our knowledge of traditional OEM product deve lopment timing, this is on schedule, if not 
                                somewhat ahead of schedule.  We continue to view the significant amount of in-sourcing 
                                (interior plastics, paint, aluminum stamping) as  the biggest potential risk to launch timing, but 
                                the company expresses confidence in these areas and we are comfortable that they have the 
                                personnel in place to garner success.  And the      order book is strong for the vehicle, as 
                                reservations (minimum $5,000 deposit required)   are 4,600 as of today (up from 3,400 at 
                                12/31/10) which is not far from the 6,500 units we expect to be produced in 2012.   

                                We were also encouraged on c ertain other variables that we consider key to the long-term 
                                earnings power of Tesla: 

                                                 Warranty:  The sufficiency of Teslas warranty reserves will be difficult to determine, 
                                given lack of experience.  However, mana       gement commented that Roadster warranty 
                                spending has remained stable as the vehicle  has aged.  Additionally,  no Roadster batteries 
                                have reached end of life, despite some vehicles being at 100k miles currently. 

                                                Leasing:  Teslas ability to offer a leas ing program for the Model S will be important, 
                                as the midsize premium sedan segment experiences heavy lease penetrations, particularly in 
                                the U.S.  Tesla currently uses its owns ba     lance sheet to finance the Roadster leasing 
                                program.  Given the higher volume on Model            S, it will require ex  ternal financing.  
                                Management commented that they are in discu ssions with several banks that are interested 
                                in providing lease financing.  Tesla, however, ma y have to share the residual value risk (risk 
                                that vehicle is worth less than originally assumed when the customers lease expires).   

                                                Average transaction prices:  Model S gro ss margins will likely be  quite sensitive to 
                                the amount of vehicle options that are purcha    sed.  Our 23% gross margin projection for 
                                Model S units includes 12% on the base vehicl e (approx $62k per-unit global average, before 
                                customer subsidies) and 50% on projected opti on content, addl battery range, and carbon 
                                reduction credits (a pprox $25k per-unit global  average).   Teslas recent announcement that 
                                initial production will be focused on highly-con tented versions of the vehicle means that 
                                margins should be quite strong initially.  An  d, although we dont consider it a direct read-
                                through, were encouraged that Roadster ATPs  have remained high and very stable, despite 
                                the vehicle being on sale since late 2008. 

                                                International sales:  Roadster sales were   50%+ non-U.S. in 1Q 11, a positive sign 
                                that brand equity is building outside of the U.S.  Our model assumes that Model S sales are 
                                50% non-U.S.  In a weak-dollar environment, non-U.S. sales could significantly higher margins

4 May 2011       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                              

                                than U.S. vehicles, as nearly all costs will be do llar-denominated.  Our Tesla valuation is very 
                                sensitive to the EUR / USD assumption. 

                                Raising price target on change to long-term EUR / USD assumption 
                                We are raising our price target to $24 from $21.50 based on a Discounted Cash Flow 
                                analysis.  The increase is completely related to a change to our long-term USD / EUR 
                                assumption to 1.30 from 1.20.  Every $0.10 weakening of the USD will add ~$3.00 per share 
                                to our Tesla valuation.  We are also fine  -tuning our 2011 / 2012 / 2013 EPS estimates to -
                                $2.02 / -$1.05 / +$2.33 from -$2.08 / -$1.11 / +$2.08. 

                                Valuation / Risks 
                                Our price target is based on a DCF analys       is. Valuing Tesla presents a unique set of 
                                challenges, given the fact that company revenue won't accelerate until 2012 and beyond. We 
                                believe that DCF is the most appropriate valuation method in this case. We assume 7% 
                                terminal growth beginning in 2020 (given our proje ction that Tesla will still be building out its 
                                vehicle portfolio and that only 9.5% of global sales will be vehicles able to be fueled from the 
                                grid in 2020, we believe that a 7% growth rate   is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT 
                                margin of 12.8% and a weighted average cost  of capital of 13.6% (we calculate WACC by 
                                using 15% cost of equity and 3.3% cost of   DOE debt and weight this over the expected 
                                capital structure from 2011 - 2015). 

                                Key downside risks include execution on the sc ale up from niche to volume manufacturing, 
                                risks associated with demand and average tran  saction price assumptions, risks associated 
                                with costs projections, and unknowns associated  with the future competitive landscape. In 
                                addition, we anticipate  limited near term revenue/earni    ngs to support the stock and, 
                                consequently, we anticipate that Tesla's shares ca n exhibit high levels of near term volatility. 
                                Upside could be derived from higher-than-ex pected Model S volumes or Powertrain sales 
                                contract wins. Given volumes of competitor ve  hicles in the 50k - 200k range, there is the 
                                potential for Tesla Model S volume to be sign       ificantly higher-than- expected. Additional 
                                customers / contracts for Powertrain sales could add significantly to our revenue / profitability 
                                targets (i.e. if current Toyota / Daimler de    velopment contracts turn into commercial 
                                production contracts).  Finally, Tesla valuation is sensitive to changes in the EUR / USD 
                                exchange rate.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
