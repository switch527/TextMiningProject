                   Tesla value to several oil and gas price sensitivities:            

                       •   A $10 rise in oil price globally could be 
                            worth 5% to Tesla shares based on our est. 
                            Tesla 2.6% share of the global xEV market in 
                            2025.  This assumes consumers shift 15% of 
                            the incremental cost burden to xEVs. 
                       •   A $1 rise in US gas price could be worth 
                            13% to Tesla shares based on our est. Tesla 
                            6.0% share of the US xEV market in 2025. 
                       •   Improves operating cost/benefit.  The typical 
                            US driver buys 480 gallons of gas per year.  
                            The burden of a $1 increase in gas price has an 
                            NPV cost of $3,500, equal to 25 to 30% of the 
                            cost of a 100-mile-range EV battery ($12,500).   
                       •   Reduces payback period.  A $1 rise in gas 
                            price reduces the payback period of an EV 
                            battery from 9.5 to 6.9 years at $500 per KWh 
                            and 25mpg for internal combustion engine.   

                   Our Tesla forecasts and $70 price target assume 
                   fuel prices rise, battery costs fall and Model S 
                   launch does not breach minimum liquidity levels.            Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with

                                                   Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                   uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                   regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                   leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                 
                                                   basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                   from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

and other considerations.

(as of March 31, 2011) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
