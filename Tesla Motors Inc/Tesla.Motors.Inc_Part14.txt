Cost-benefit methodology behind our xEV model.  We have attempted to determine the financial inflection point for operating 
costs, which is one of the objective factors driving our US xEV demand model. We note that several other factors also drive EV 
demand, some of which are more subjective including image, political will etc. These subjective factors could be even more influential 
than the cost factor in determining xEV demand.  For our model, we assume the average car drives 12,000 miles/year and gets 25 
mpg, and we estimate a weekly gasoline consumption of 8-9 gallons/week. We note that US consumers tend to feel the pain of high 
gas prices between $3.50-$4 per gallon. This means the average consumer would be comfortable spending no more than $30 per 
week on gasoline costs. As part of our xEV model, we have tried to maintain the weekly gasoline/electricity spend at $30 per week by 
substituting more PHEVs and EVs in the car fleet, as gasoline prices get to $5, $6 and higher between now and 2025.

Valuation: We argue Tesla cannot be valued on near-term multiple metrics like traditional auto companies given that we expect Tesla 
to multiply revenues by over 20x from 2010 to 2015, by more than 80x by 2020 and over 150x by 2025.  We have thus chosen a 
15-year time horizon for our DCF which captures the full utilization of Teslas manufacturing capacity in Fremont, the full maturation of 
the Model S, Model X (and top-hat derivatives) and also the ramp up of its mass market electric vehicle (the Gen 3).  We have applied 
a 12% WACC with a range of 10% to 14%.  The terminal value accounts for around 60% to 70% of the total DCF value across the 
range of methodologies we have applied to arrive at our $70 PT                                                                                      .

                                                   regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                   leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                 
                                                   basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                   from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of March 31, 2011) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
