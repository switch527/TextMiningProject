ACTV: Going Deep and Wide With Starcite

THINK ACTION:
We  like  the  potential  synergies  of  the  Starcite  acquisition  and  believe  the                  Brian Schwartz

  Starcite's customer base and selling Starcite's products into The Active
  Network customers.

Potential Risks of the Starcite Acquisition
  This is the largest acquisition since its IPO for The Active Network which by
  nature will carry risks.
  ACTV could lose focus on its other three core operating segments in favor of,
  what we view as, the faster growing business segment.
  Starcite had many customers that are subscription based and thus The
  Active Network will need to come up with a strategy to successfully migrate
  Starcite's customers over to ACTV's mostly transaction-based model.

  2012 Model Changes

We have added ~$36M in revenue and reduced our PF EPS by $0.02.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 21x EV/EBITDA
multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $47M. We assume ACTV maintains a slightly higher valuation multiple and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is similar to our 20%
long-term CAGR expectation.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.
