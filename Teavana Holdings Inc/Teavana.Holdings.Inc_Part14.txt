           FY Jan      2011A      2012E     2013E     The  details.  Teavana  announced  its  acquisition  of  Teaopia,  a  leading  Canadian
                                                      specialty tea retailer, for $26.9 million in an all-cash transaction. Teavana will use cash

           4Q           $0.32     $0.42        --     and $0.03-$0.04 accretive in FY13, excluding transaction costs.

                                                      The    acquisition    should    drive    long-term    earnings    growth.    Teaopia    had
           First Call      --    $0.62E    $0.79E
                                                      approximately CAD $17 million in sales for its 46 company-owned stores in high-
           P/E          43.0x     33.5x      24.4x    quality  mall  locations  across  Canada.  Despite  a  similar  product  mix,  overall  mall
                                                      productivity and loose-leaf tea contribution, Teaopia had sales productivity less than
                                                      half Teavana ($435,000 at Teaopia vs. $913,000 at Teavana). We believe that, over
                                                      time, Teavana's management team can raise sales productivity levels to Teavana's
                                                      levels. Should management be successful in achieving this and driving a 25% four-wall
                                                      contribution margin (similar to Teavana in the United States), the transaction could be
                                                      (excluding transaction costs and interest expense) up to $0.16 accretive ± see Exhibit 2.

                                                      The important takeaway: Teavana has a truly unique store operating model. We
                                                      find it interesting that a similar ± okay, basically a copycat ± concept (similar look,
                                                      store size, mall productivity, loose leaf tea contribution, and even POS) can have a
                                                      sales productivity less than half of Teavana's. What does this mean to us? We think
                                                      it shows that Teavana's ªspecialnessº arises not from its store format or product mix.
                                                      Rather, it stems from its unique, highly consultative store model as well as its unique
                                                      products. The aforementioned are what give rise to Teavana's $1,000 per square foot
                                                      sales productivity, and frankly, despite the best efforts of competitors, are not easily
                                                      duplicated.

VALUATION
At 33.5x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.1x 2012 PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high-growth retailer. We think the
Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new store
economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average of 31.6x 2012
P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 15.6x 2012 EV/EBITDA compared to 13.1x
EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We reiterate our $28 price target, which implies a 47.4x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
Risks that could impede TEA from reaching our price target include, but are not limited to the following: ability to identify
suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, retention of senior management.
