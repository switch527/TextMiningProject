Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.
3) Complications from M&A integration.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,
Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7. We reserve the right to amend or supplement this policy at any time.

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trade Ideas

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.
