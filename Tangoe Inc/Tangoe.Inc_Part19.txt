product-oriented approach an d a multi-tenant SaaS platform provides scale and                  
margin leverage over time.  Tangoe has also taken advantage of the fragmentation 
to make five key acquisitions since 2007,  entering new segments, geographies or 
acquiring a customer base.  The compan             ys recent partnerships with global 
system integrators IBM, Dell, HP and X            erox, significantly expand its reach.  
Tangoes solution supports 1,700 operator   billing models in 180 countries, 125 
currencies and 16 languages, providing significant barriers to entry. 
Sticky solution with high visibility 
Tangoes bundled technology and services generally pay for themselves within the 
first year, creating a sticky solution and  a recurring revenue stream.  The 2-5 year 
contracts and proven deployment methodolog y provide high visibility into future 
revenues, typically 70% in the year ahea d and 90% a quarter ahead.  Customers 
deploying Tangoes solution benefit immediately from the automation of bill 
processing, a tedious monthly ritual at mo st enterprises globally.  Customers can 
also reduce their spending by detecting err ors, optimizing contracts, provisioning 
new service or device and managing mobile devices remotely. 
Buy rating and a $17 price target 
Our $17 price target is based on a CY13             uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x (slight        premium to the peer group given market 
leadership), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 26%.  Risks 
include execution risk from  integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
projects not ramping fast enough and   customers taking expense processing in-
house after early gains from Tangoes platform.  See also pp. 31-33.

                               Investment thesis 

                               Outlook 

                               Tangoe is the clear market leader in the em   erging segment of communications lifecycle 
                               management.  Over the past decade, Tangoe ha s developed a platform to help enterprises 
                               manage and optimize their        telecommunications spending.  We believe Tangoe's 
                               comprehensive solution, robustly growing recu rring revenue (>25% organically) and global 
                               reach give investors an opportunity to own a quality stock early in its public life.   

                               With about $14bn in expenses under management, Tangoe is 3x larger than its closest 
                               competitor in the space, which today is     fairly fragmented and predominantly services-
                               oriented.  We believe Tangoes product-oriente d approach and a multi-tenant SaaS platform 
                               provides scale and margin leverage over ti    me.  Tangoe has taken advantage of the 
                               fragmentation to make five key acquisitions  since 2007, entering new segments, geography 
                               or acquiring a customer base.  And the compan  ys recent partnerships with global system 
                               integrators IBM, Dell, HP and Xerox significan  tly expand their reach.  The global presence 
                               developed over the past decade supports 1,700 operator billing models in 180 countries, 125 
                               currencies and 16 languages providing significant barriers to entry. 

                               Tangoes bundled technology and services genera lly pay for themselves within the first year, 
                               creating a sticky solution and a recurring reve nue stream.  Tangoes 2-5 year contracts and 
                               proven deployment methodology provide high visi bility into future revenues, typically 70% in 
                               the year ahead and 90% in the quarter ahea     d.  Customers deploying Tangoes solution 
                               benefit immediately from the automation of bi ll processing, a tedious monthly ritual at most 
                               enterprises globally.  Customers can also     reduce their spending by detecting errors, 
                               optimizing contracts, provisi oning new service, managing mobile devices remotely and 
                               device disposal/recycling. 

                               Valuation 

                               We believe its best to value companies like Tangoe based on their cash flows.  Our $17 
                               price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share esti mate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x 
                               (in line with the peer group), and a five-year grow th rate, net of dilution, of 23%.  We cross-
                               check our valuation with a DCF analysis, shown on pages 32-33. 

                               Risks 

                               Risks include execution risk fr  om integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
                               projects not ramping fast enough and customers  taking expense processing in-house after 
                               early gains from Tangoes platform.  Some       customers may also perceive aggregated 
                               customer data as a privacy issue.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                   

                               Investment Positives 

                               Commanding lead in a nascent, specialized market segment 
                               Tangoe is the clear market leader in the emerging segment of telecom expense management 
                               (TEM), with global scale and a rapidly growing adjacency into mobile device management.  
                               Tangoe offers a complete portfolio that includes  fixed and mobile TEM solutions, particularly 
                               attractive to multinational corporations who can consolidate their cost savings on to a single 
                               platform.  The bundled technology and servic es measurably reduce telecom expenses, with 
                               payback typically within the first year.   

                               Powerful barriers to entry 
                               Tangoe is the largest provider in the TEM soft  ware space with roughly 8% market share, 
                               based on annual recurring revenues.  The next ne arest competitor is less than a third the size 
                               in a still-fragmented market  dominated by consulting firms and relatively few purely product-
                               oriented solutions.  Tangoe currently manage s about $14bn telecom expenses annually in a 
                               market of over $400bn globally, allowing abundant  room to grow over time.  Tangoes global 
                               presence developed over the past decade, with  support for 1,700 operator billing models in 
                               180 countries, 125 currencies and 16 languages provide significant barriers to entry. 

                               Acquisitions accelerate market share, backed by strong organic analysis  
                               Tangoe has made five acquisitions since 2007,  each of which enabled the company to gain 
                               market share as well expand its portfolio.  In addition, organic revenue consistently grew over 
                               20% (over 25% for recurring) during this period , together delivering revenue CAGR of almost 
                               50% since 2007. 

                               Scale benefits from a product-oriented approach 
                               Tangoes on-demand software platform provides  customers relatively quick deployment that 
                               drives high automation rates after the initial setup.  The scalable multi-tenant architecture has 
                               the potential to cannibalize a largely consulti ng-oriented market that is over $500m in size, 
                               since product effectiveness is consistently hi gher and these scale benefits result in higher 
                               margins over time. 

                               Highly visible recurring revenue 
                               Tangoes contract term ranges from 24 mont     hs to 60 months with ASPs ranging from 
                               $150k-200k.  Tangoes revenue mix is 90% rec  urring given the nature of monthly telecom 
                               bills.  Multi-year contracts and the convenience of automating  a historically manual process 
                               tend to create a sticky solution with customers .  Retention rates have been consistently over 
                               90%, with any loss typically due to customers e  xiting the market alto gether, e.g., through 
                               consolidation or M&A. 

                               Diversified, blue-chip customer base  
                               Tangoe has flagship customers across the financial, healthcare, technology, consulting, and 
                               transportation verticals.  Some leading cust omers are Bank of America, Novartis, Dell, IBM 
                               and FedEx. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for 2008, 2009 
                               or 2010. Today, most customers are US-based mu ltinationals, but a new sales office in the 
                               Netherlands should help expand the companys footprint into Western Europe, a market only 
                               slightly behind the US in the development of TEM solutions. 

                               Strong channel partners expand reach 
                               In an effort to expand reach  and accelerate global growth, Tangoe has signed on leading 
                               system integration firms, including IBM, Dell, HP, Xerox and 16 other regional firms.  Share or 
                               partner-driven revenue is relatively small toda y, but over 20% of new bookings are coming 
                               from the channel, a share we expect to grow over time.

                               Investment Risks 

                               Once early gains are captured in reducing costs, customers may take efforts in-house 
                               Customers pay a percentage of savings to Ta   ngoe. Once systematiz ed, customers could 
                               decide to save themselves the payment to Ta ngoe by taking the processing of invoices in-
                               house.  There have been no recent incidents of customer loss in such a fashion. 

                               People-intensive model could hurt margins if customers dont ramp up as planned 
                               Integrating the customers IT environment into Tangoes infrastructure is a complex task and 
                               delays could impact margins.  The company  has a standardize approach developed over the 
                               past decade, but rapid growth into new geographies and use of partners to deliver solutions 
                               may impact the margin profile. 

                               Acquired assets may not get integrated efficiently 
                               The companys growth has benefited from five acquisitions made since 2007.  While each of 
                               these acquisitions has improved the companys    strategic position in  the market and the 
                               relatively low multiples paid have helped accret ion, integration of future acquisitions could 
                               become more complex as the company grows larger. 

                               Aggregated customer data could be perceived as a privacy or competitive risk 
                               Tangoes knowledgebase of contracts and best practices is built up over time by aggregating 
                               historical data, which some customers might  consider risky from a privacy perspective. Any 
                               dramatic changes in the regulatory environment may also impact Tangoes ability to compete 
                               internationally. 

                               Large customers or resellers such as IBM and Dell could concentrate revenues 
                               Loss of a large customer or channel could      significantly impact the business. Current 
                               customer count of over 600 and no customer over 10% of revenue reduce this likelihood. 

                               Lack of up-front billings suppress cash flow as compared to typical SaaS model 
                               The company bills customers monthly in arrears  as new invoices are processed. Unlike the 
                               typical SaaS company, where ad vance billing results in significa nt deferred revenue build-up, 
                               Tangoes business model does not benefit from up-front cash payments.  However, future 
                               cash flows should grow higher with the number of customers and expenses under 
                               management. 

                               Channel approach and expansion into new geographies increase cost profile 
                               The companys efforts to expand  internationally by partnering  with local resellers and by 
                               establishing local offices could increase costs and reduce margins during this expansion.

                               Industry Overview 

                               Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM) 

                               The telecom industry has seen significant cha nge over the past decade, with the growth in 
                               VoIP, mobile voice and data s ervices, and changes in regulator y regimes globally, most of 
                               which caused dramatic changes in tariffs and   the competitive landscape.  As corporations 
                               began to expand globally, spen ding on telecom services took  on a much more significant 
                               role. Enterprises are increasingly seeking solu  tions to effectively an d efficiently manage, 
                               control and optimize their expanding communica tions assets, services, usage and associated 
                               expenses. The CLM market provides solutions to  help meet this demand. The CLM market 
                               consists of the telecommunications expense ma nagement, or TEM, market and the mobile 
                               device management, or MDM, market, which is an emerging market adjacent to TEM. 

                               Corporations globally spend over $400bn annually on  telecom services, which include office 
                               phones, internet and data connectivity, wirele ss voice and data services and more recently, 
                               the remote management of mobile devices used  by staff.  Inefficient management of these 
                               expenses, including overpayments due to billing  errors, often results in enterprises incurring 
                               significant avoidable expenses. Below we disc uss some common trends  driving the uptake 
                               of CLM solutions. 

                               Large volume and complexity of bills 
                               A companys communications infrastructure is     critical for its smooth operations. With 
                               advancing technology, communication infrastructure has encompassed a growing diversity of 
                               technologies. Billing systems vary across operato rs, each with varying payment terms.  And 
                               different countries have different regulatory an d tax regimes. Multi-national companies have 
                               to contend with multiple operators, currencies, languages and regulatory requirements. This 
                               provides a ripe opportunity for telecom expense management.  

                               Significant increase in the number of mobile users and what devices are used for 
                               Mobile devices and their use fo r both voice and data applicat ions looks dramatically different 
                               today than it did just five years ago.  Not on ly are more people roaming with their devices as 
                               they travel, many are using smartphones an    d tablets to access enterprise applications 
                               remotely in addition to making plain old phon  e calls.  The need to manage expenses and 
                               devices is amplified by IT security and policy concerns as several personal devices are 
                               provisioned for corporate use and vice vers  a.  Gartner estimates worldwide converged 
                               mobile device enterprise shipments grew at   a CAGR of 54% from 2005-10. And mobile 
                               applications deployed by enterprises will grow at 30% in 2011. 

                               Dynamic changes in communication infrastructure and services creates a need for TEM 
                               Telecommunication expenditure, ranging 1%-3%  of revenue, is a significant portion of an 
                               enterprise budget. Gartner estimates TEM serv  ices to grow at a double-digit compound 
                               annual growth rate through 2014. There are   roughly 300 TEM vendors globally with about 
                               $1bn market size in 2011. The top 10 software-oriented vendors account for about $200m in 
                               recurring revenue.  The rest is a highly fragmented mix of services-oriented firms who 
                               perform custom projects for clients.  These pro jects typically dont use a robust technology 
                               back-end and have low repeatability across customers. 

                               Note the distinction between telecom expense s (over $400bn annually) and the TEM vendor 
                               space, which is estimated at about $1bn per ye  ar.  The latter is the collective revenue of 
                               vendors who provide TEM solutions to optimize  the $400bn annual spend.  The market size 
                               for mobile device management, MDM, is es  timated by IDC to be about $300m in 2010, 
                               growing to $1.2bn in 2015.  Depending on the definition and scope of MDM, various industry

                                  analysts size this market ranging from a few      hundred million dollars to  a billion dollars or 
                                  more per year.  We believe $300m is a reasonable estimate for 2010 given the plethora 
                                  smartphones and tablets hitting the market and  the number of enterprise applications being 
                                  made available on them.  We estimate MDM should grow by 25% y/y or more, over the next 
                                  five years.

                                     Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a relatively new area where typical functions include: 

                                                Device provisioning, configuration and inventory management 

                                                Distributing software, including OS updates, over the air directly to the device 

                                                Managing the software image remotely so user doesnt install disallowed software 

                                                Backup/restore capability for content on the device 

                                                Security and policy administration for the device 

                                                Device monitoring and remote kill if th          e device is lost, stolen or if employee 
                                                leaves the firm 

                                                Mobility management: roaming management, location reporting, etc. 

                                     Obviously the capabilities of ea  ch device determine the level of functionality that can be 
                                     made available via an MDM platform.  Enterpri  se-oriented devices like the BlackBerry were 
                                     built with many of these capabilities in the          back-end infrastructure.  And many consumer-
                                     oriented devices like the iPhone and Android              have an ecosystem of third-party software 
                                     vendors building such capabilities.  Vendors   in MDM range from small pure-play shops to 
                                     large enterprise software and security vendors.    

                                     Market penetration assumptions and scenarios 

                                     Considering the global enterprise telecom spend of $430bn, Tangoe currently manages about 
                                     $14bn, just 3% of this industry revenue strea  m. With such low penet ration today and with 
                                     Tangoe being the leading player, the opportunity ahead is large and attractive.  

                                     In our scenario analysis below, we change                  market penetration each year by 100 
                                     bps/120bps/150bps y/y in our base case/optimisti c case/aggressive case. It is worth noting 
                                     that a small increase in penetration levels ac ts as a powerful lever, almost doubling revenue 
                                     from $360m revenue in 2020 in the base case   scenario to over $600m in revenue with an 
                                     aggressive scenario.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                   

                               Competition 

                               As described in the Industry section above,   Tangoe operates primarily in the TEM domain 
                               with a growing presence in mobile device management (MDM).  Tangoe is the only company 
                               that has a presence in both TEM and MDM spac  e. Tangoe is ranked a leader in Gartners 
                               TEM Magic Quadrant for the breadth and completeness of its portfolio, process 
                               management and advisory services.   

                               Within the MDM space, Gartner rates Tangoe a  Challenger with competitive products that 
                               address the basic needs of MDM.  Industry an alyst IDC estimates Tang oes market share in 
                               MDM to be about 2% in 2010 as larger vendors such as Sybase (part of SAP), Microsoft, HP, 
                               IBM and Symantec take the top five spots in  the space, collectively with about 48% market 
                               share.  Clearly, Tangoe is a small player in MDM,  but its offering sold with TEM is likely more 
                               attractive to enterprise clients who dont want to invest in a large, standalone MDM solution. 

                               Market leader with significant lead vs. competition 
                               Tangoe is far ahead of its competitors in th  e domain of telecom expense management.  
                               Based on estimates of software-based vendors  with a recurring revenue model, Tangoe is

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                     

                                Other notable competitors fall in three broad groups: 

                                         Large SI firms with global presence  : focus on multinational customers and a 
                                         vendor- neutral, consulting-oriented approach: Accenture, CSC, Dell (Perot 
                                         Systems), IBM Global Services, HP (EDS), X erox (ACS) fall in this group. Note that 
                                         IBM is Tangoes largest partner and Dell, HP and Xerox are new partnerships. 

                                         Large telcos : AT&T and Vodafone provide TEM s  ervices to their large enterprise 
                                         clients. However, since these services are  provided by the operator themselves, in 
                                         many markets via private-label offerings,  there is a heavier services and consulting 
                                         component and a perceived lack of neutrality. 

                                         Smaller consulting and product providers  : Anatole (France), Asential, Avalon 
                                         Avotus, Ezwim (Netherlands), MDSL (UK       ), Telesoft, TNX, Ttmobiles (UK) and 
                                         Veramark. Each of these vendors specializes   in a region, fixed or mobile, size of 
                                         customer, BPO model, etc., with revenues ranging from $5m to $15m annually.  

                                Competition in the MDM space is much more fragmented at the lower end of the market. 
                                However, as discussed above, the top five players own about half the market. But given the 
                                rapidly evolving smartphone and tablet mark  etplace, we could see many of the following 
                                specialty vendors make headway on their own,   or get acquired by larger firms: AirWatch, 
                                Boxtone, Capricode (Finland),    Excitor (Denmark), FancyFon     (Ireland), Fiberlink, Fixmo, 
                                Fromdistance (Estonia), IBELEM (France), MobileIron, Good Technology (best known for 
                                push email platform), Zenprise, etc. 

                                Traditional security firms like Symantec, Mc Afee, and connectivity software companies like 
                                Smith Micro consider MDM an adjacent space to expand their core offering.

                               Summary of customer diligence 

                               We conducted several diligence calls across Tangoes customer base, ranging from relatively 
                               small to fairly large. 

                               Consistent themes from customers  
                               Customers acknowledged Tangoes deep domain ex pertise in operator contracts, billing and 
                               geographic variations.  They also descri   bed the maturity of Tangoes processes and 
                               consistency in their deployment methodology th  at gets projects ramped quickly.  Larger 
                               accounts also appreciate the high level of execut ive involvement even after the project is up 
                               and running.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                 

                               Other highlights: 

                                       Fixed and Mobile TEM widely deployed   MDM and new device recycling service 
                                       gaining traction, particularly with larger  enterprises who are introducing consumer-
                                       oriented devices into their enterprise environment. 
                                       Customer feedback on features makes it back into product 
                                       On-demand platform attractive to many cu stomers since they dont want to staff 
                                       TEM internally or invest in their own equipment 
                                       Some customers have been using the produc t for over 5 years are still happy with 
                                       results.  One customer said, We got back $3 for every $1 we spent with Tangoe. 
                                       Customer perception is that fixed and mobile are two different products, which they 
                                       are today.  Architecture work is on-going to create a common product. 
                                       Early days of international expansion were  rocky.  New office in Amsterdam helps 
                                       with European deployments (second largest TEM market) 
                                       Former HCL customers were pleased about Tangoes acquisition 

                               Customer case study summary show measurable ROI 
                               Although Tangoe does not disclose contract de tails, its ASP ranges from $150k- $200k, with 
                               top 100 customers approaching $600k. We have       summarized snap shots of successful 
                               customer case studies below.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                    

                               Savings continue to accrue over time 
                               The value proposition that clients derive out  of implementing Tangoe solutions ranges from 
                               reducing errors that typically affect 25% of all   bills to lowering ongoing cost by 20%-40%.  
                               Without streamlined expense management, co mpanies lose between $500k to $50m each 
                               year.  Tangoe manages spend 3x larger and 5x   more devices than its closest competitor, 
                               given its breadth and strength in product s pectrum, now about $14bn in expenses and 1.8m 
                               mobile devices. 

                               After the initial gains in the first year, Tangoe continues to optimize contracts based on 
                               market rates and manages turnover in devices, voice/data plans, applications on devices, etc. 

                               Business Model 

                               Tangoe generates its revenues from subscriptions and services related to its 
                               Communications Management Platform. Thes          e services include help desk, asset 
                               procurement and provisioning, an d carrier dispute resolution.  The recurring technology and 
                               services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Tangoe licenses its on-demand 
                               software primarily on a subscription basis un der agreements with terms ranging from 24 to 
                               60 months.  

                               The company bills its customers on a monthly     basis in arrears and hence does not have 
                               significant deferred revenues on  its balance sheet.  We note this significant difference from 
                               our other SaaS coverage, where annual or qu     arterly pre-payments are standard and cash 
                               collected up front with subsequent ratable revenue recognition boosts the cash flow margins 
                               for these companies.   

                               Figure 10 below shows the significant impa      ct pre-payments (shown as days deferred 
                               revenue, or DDR) can have on a companys un      levered free-cash-flow margins.  Note the 
                               difference in the theoretical cash flow margin s for a company growing revenue at 25% with 
                               DDR of 40 (a profile similar to Tangoe), compa red to another company growing at the same 
                               revenue rate but with DDR of 100 (typical of a SaaS company in our coverage).  Prepayments 
                               boost uFCF margin by about 4% points in this scenario, with an assumed baseline of 8% 
                               uFCF margin.  Investors should take this    into consideration when studying Tangoe. We 
                               discuss this further in the Valuation section.

                                 Tangoes bookings growth indicates positive momentum increasing from $9.7m in FY2008 to 
                                 $18.7m in FY2010 at a CAGR of 39%.The expected ARR for FY2011 is $28.5m (with 
                                 contribution from the HCL and Telwares acqu isitions) and that of FY2012 is $31.3m. Of the 
                                 new bookings, 40% - 60% come from the co  mpanys direct sales efforts and 20%- 30% 
                                 come via the partner.  IBM is the oldest ch annel partner and now brings in over 10% of new 
                                 bookings, while the new partners, Dell (via Perot) , HP (via EDS) and Xerox (via ACS) are still

                               The TCV is also showing a positive trend with  the TCV increasing from $23.5m in FY2007 to 
                               $60.2m in FY2010 reflecting a CAGR of 37%. The     Adjusted EBITDA margin for Tangoe is 
                               10% in FY2010 with retention rate >90%. In addition to +20% organic revenue growth,  

                               Tangoe started the transition to SaaS in 2  006. Revenue from recurring mix has increased 
                               from 28% recurring in 2006 to 84% in 2010. 1Q11 showed 89% recurring mix, 90% in 2Q11. 
                               Tangoe has seen 22 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. 

                               Tangoes main focus is on the sales and ma       rketing efforts to increase its recurring 
                               technology and services-related customer base.  It aims to increase the recurring technology 
                               and services revenue in absolute dollars and  as a percentage of total revenue over the next 
                               12 months. With a retention rate of over   90% and recurring revenues already at 90%, we 
                               expect margins to improve over time as scale increases.

                               2010, a CAGR of 48%. We expect the growth momentum to continue as Tangoe leverages 
                               its position as the leading provider of CLM so  lutions. The revenue is mostly recurring with 
                               more than 90% visibility going into each quarter and about 70% a year ahead. Acquisitions 
                               drove total revenue growth in tandem with strong organic growth, as shown in Figures 15-16

                               from $14.3m in FY2007 to $68.5m to FY2010      reflecting a CAGR of 68%. We expect the 
                               organic revenue to grow a bit slower as the revenue base grows.

                                since 2007.  However, we are modeling organic         growth rate at 18-20% to factor in 
                                conservatism in the model.

                                Tangoe has made five key acquisitions sinc    e 2007 to expand its product and customer 
                                footprint.  The companys acquisitions are based on three key motivations: 

                                         Expand technology assets 

                                         New geographies 

                                         New customers 

                                The company has been disciplined about sales multiples for these acquisitions, typically 
                                paying 2x-3x of sales at the high end and below  1x at the low end, depending on the type of 
                                asset and percentage of recurring revenue.  Tr aditional software M&A multiples are usually 
                                higher, with our 10-year industry database    showing acquirers payi ng 4x-6x maintenance 
                                multiples in public company software M&A.  Tangoes gradually increasing operating margins 
                                during this period also indicates they are effective in the integration process.   

                                Also of note is the fact that executives fr om the acquired companie s generally have stayed 
                                on at Tangoe to run their respective business as  a division within Tangoe, another sign that 
                                these integrations are effective. 

                                Figure 17 shows a summary of the acquisitions.  We describe them in more detail below the

                                    Traq brought wireless TEM capabilities to Tangoe s organic fixed TEM platform.  Traq also 
                                    helped Tangoe accelerate its transition to         a recurring revenue model, as most of Traqs 
                                    revenue was recurring.  The mobile TEM and  fixed TEM products remained separate, mostly 
                                    since operators providing these services continue  to retain separate billing systems and end-
                                    users of fixed line services vs. mobile services  are also different within the typical enterprise.  
                                    Specifically, fixed-line services in the ent       erprise are related to de      sk phones and data 
                                    connectivity, where the end user is seldom involv ed in provisioning, bill payments, etc.  On 
                                    the other hand, with mobile devices, enterprises have a mix of corporate-liable and individual-
                                    liable devices, and end users a re typically involved in the paym ent of bills, either directly or 
                                    through their IT department. 

                                    Information Strategies Group (ISG)   had a fixed TEM product with a recurring revenue 
                                    model.  ISG also brought international capabiliti es to Tangoes solution .  By July 2008, over 
                                    half of Tangoes revenues were recurring in na ture.  By the end of  2008, Tangoe crossed the 
                                    80% threshold with the addition of ISG to the revenue mix. 

                                    Internoded was Tangoes foray into Mobile Device Management (MDM).  By the second 
                                    half of 2008, MDM had begun to get the attent ion of enterprises as the iPhone and Android 
                                    devices were becoming mainstream, applicatio ns were proliferating and enterprises were 
                                    looking for solutions to manage these typica            lly individual-liable de vices in a corporate 
                                    environment.  MDM was a natural adjacenc              y to TEM and Tangoe expanded its market 
                                    definition to include device-ori ented services, calling it CLM.  Internodeds platform has 
                                    evolved in its capabilities sinc e the acquisition but remains a standalone part of Tangoes 
                                    portfolio. 

                                    HCL Expense Management Services    and  Telwares acquisitions were both clearly a 
                                    strategic expansion of operations and enlargem ent of the customer base, with the potential 
                                    to cross-sell to the customers of HCL and Telw            ares the capabilities of Tangoes existing 
                                    solution. Through this acquisition the co         mpany added more than 100 customers with 
                                    aggregate annual telecommunications expense  under management in excess of $3 billion.  
                                    Both acquisitions were made in 1Q11, just befo re Tangoes IPO.  We believe the price paid 
                                    for both was below 1x sales, as both bu             sinesses had declining revenues and limited 
                                    technology differentiation. 

                                    Our analysis of organic revenues indicates that the company has been consistently growing 
                                    total revenue at over 20% for the past three years, with recurring revenues growing 
                                    organically over 25%.

                                We expect EBITDA margin to grow at a sl        ower pace near-term since Tangoe plans to 
                                investments in technological and process improvements along with overseas expansion. The 
                                EBITDA is expected to increase from $6.8M  to $12m (74% growth) in 2011. We expect the 
                                cost of recurring technology and services reve nue which consists of costs associated with 
                                data center operations, customer product suppo      rt centers and client services group to 
                                remain relatively stable on an annual basis.  

                                Tangoes business model comes with lower gross margins because of higher proportion of 
                                consulting and service content associated wi    th taking new customers live.  Like other 
                                companies in our coverage with technology-enabled services, human capital involved in 
                                implementing its solutions na turally suppresses gross margins as compared to more pure 
                                SaaS models. Specifically, gross margin is expected to decrease to 53% in 2011 due to 
                                acquisition of HCL and Telwares which had gross margins significantly below corporate 
                                average compared to 56% for Tangoe last         year.  With increasing focus on expanding 
                                software functionality of current offerings R&  D expense is expected to increase in dollar 
                                terms but decrease in percentage terms,       over time. R&D, G&A and Sales marketing 
                                investments are expected to be up by 35%, 23% and 27% in 2011 due to increased focus on 
                                technological and process improvements   .

                                    Operating cash flow has been positive for full year 2009 and 2010. It is likely to increase post 
                                    debt repayment as net interest expense is expected to decrease by 117% from FY11 to FY12 
                                    which should effectevly increase the net income. Cash flow from financing will show a one-
                                    time inflow from the IPO. The uFCF margin   grew from (2%) in 2008 (critical mass of SaaS 
                                    transition) to 6% in 2010. It is projected to  grow to 11% in 2012. The capex is about 2% of 
                                    revenue.

                                           Valuation 

                                           Tangoes subscription model is driven by a  relatively steady, recurring revenue stream from 
                                           multi-year contracts as well as new in-year                     bookings.  We believe it is best to value 
                                           subscription-based companies on a growth-adjusted unlevered free cash flow basis.  Our $17 
                                           price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share esti mate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x 
                                           (slight premium to group given market leadership), and a five-year growth rate, net of dilution, 
                                           of 26%.

                                           Continuing our discussion from Figure 10, we note that since Tangoe doesnt bill customers 
                                           in advance, relative to other S aaS companies, its days of deferred revenue (DDR) metric is 
                                           relatively low, in the 47 range vs. our SaaS med ian of 93.  The current valuation for Tangoe, 
                                           therefore, is distorted by this fact, although the recurrent nature of its revenues is very similar 
                                           to other SaaS companies.  If Tangoe were to  bill customers in advance and had DDRs of 93 
                                           (median for our SaaS coverage), its unlevered cash flow margins would increase significantly, 
                                           from our CY12 estimate of 13% to 17%, based on   the analysis shown in Figure 11 earlier.  
                                           This would drive down the EV/FCF multiple, wh                       ich is at 24.3x currently, to 18.7x.  We

Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or otherwise, in a manner   inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including strategists and 
sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this  report constitute the current judgement of  the author as of the  date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without 
notice. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof in th e event that any opinion, forecast or estimate  set forth herein, changes or subsequently becomes

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
