                    We like TEAs 500 store potential Our Teavana real 
                    estate analysis validates managements 500 store 2015 
                    plan (vs. 179 today).  In our universe, TEA has one of 
                    the lowest saturation rates (2011e stores vs. long term 
                    plan) at 39% vs. the 72% average.      

                    steady comp performance We think Teavanas 
                    3% comp plan is achievable given 1) past performance 
                    and 2) our projected new store real estate/demographic 
                    analysis based on AlphaWise data.    

                    and ~260 bp gross margin expansion from 
                    2010-15e.  We think 2015 gross margin can reach 
                    65.5%, driven by positive mix as stores mature.  Older 
                    stores sell more higher-margin loose tea vs. 
                    lower-margin accessories.   

                    Current valuation reflects growth:  At 40x our $0.60 
                    2012e EPS (and 1.4x our 28% long term growth rate), 
                    we think shares largely reflect Teavanas sales and 
                    earnings potential.  We look for 1) a more attractive entry 
                    point or 2) sustained >MSD% same store sales growth.

                    Risks to our call:  (1) Weakening / strengthening                  companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                                                                                       a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                    economy and mall traffic; (2) Increased competition                have a conflict of interest that could affect the 
                    (stores, online); (3) positive margin mix shift fails to           objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors 
                    materialize.                                                       should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a

The retailer is the undisputed leader in its space and               Exhibit 5 
enjoys a premium positioning, which is reinforced by the             Teavana Store: Paramus Park Mall (Paramus, NJ) 
highly trained store staff that drives product connoisseurship.  
We think this could help drive trade-up among existing tea 
drinkers as well as attract new consumers to the beverage.  We 
like Teavanas focus on the healthy lifestyle  the same 
positioning behind Whole Foods and lululemons success.  
TEAs 179 locations are primarily located in shopping malls 
and lifestyle centers.  We think the companys proprietary 
product, education-rich sales environment, and brand 
awareness through its store footprint pose formidable barriers 
to entry.           

We like TEAs 25% square footage growth CAGR 
(2010-2015)  Our proprietary shopping center analysis gives 
us confidence TEA has enough high-quality potential locations

    •   2Q11 results. On September 2, 2011, TEA reported                     offer greater sales and EPS accretion potential.  
        2Q11 EPS of $0.03.  Net sales rose +36% (to $31.3 
        million).  Same store sales rose 6.9%, driven by a          Risks to our call:  (1) Weakening / strengthening economy 
        9.3% ticket increase.  Transactions declined -1.8%,         and mall traffic; (2) Increased competition (stores, online); (3) 
        inline with TEAs historical range (slightly positive to    positive margin mix shift fails to materialize. 
        slightly negative).

    •       Gross margin increased +223 bp y/y (to 61.1%),            and Stephen Bakke of the Morgan Stanley REIT Research 
        driven by better product margins (direct sourcing) and      team for use of their US mall data. 
        a sales mix shift towards loose tea (58% of 2Q11 
        sales vs. 57% in 2Q10).  SG&A deleveraged 204 bp to 
        49.1% while D&A of $1.4 million remained flattish as a 
        percent of total sales (4.6%).  Higher SG&A costs 
        were due to: 1) new hires (public company transition); 
        2) new store opening and training; 3) infrastructure; 
        and 4) distribution strategy related consulting fees.  
        The operating margin increased +24 bp to 7.4%.  Net 
        income rose 78.5% y/y to $1.0 million.  2Q11s $0.03 
        EPS was vs. LYs $0.02.    

    •       As of September 2, 2011, TEA had 179 
        company-owned stores.  The company is on track up 
        open 50 new locations in FY11.  Total inventory rose 
        82% y/y to $22.7 million.  Teavanas direct sourcing 
        strategy shift (TEA takes possession of goods earlier; 
        was in full force by 3Q10) drove the y/y increase.  
        In-store inventory remained flat vs. LY.  

    •       Management also initiated 2011 and long-term 
        guidance.  For 2011: $160 - $164 million sales (with 
        low- to mid-single digit same store sales) and $0.42 - 
        $0.44 EPS (based on $16 - $16.8 million net income 
        and 38.3 million shares).  Longer-term outlook (from 
        2010 figures): 25% revenue CAGR, +300 bp 
        operating margin expansion, and 30% net income 
        growth.        

    •   International franchise agreement with Alshaya 
        Group.  On September 2, 2011, TEA announced a 
        10-year franchise development program with the 
        Alshaya group of companies for opening stores in 
        Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab 
        Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan.  The first 
        stores are scheduled to open in 2012.  Under the 
        agreement, we expect TEA will receive a percentage 
        of sales (we estimate 5-6%, based on previous 
        industry franchise transactions).  In our view, we 
        believe the franchises could be slightly accretive to 
        2013 sales (not reflected in our model).  While we 
        view the Alshaya agreement positively, we think

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of August 31, 2011) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
