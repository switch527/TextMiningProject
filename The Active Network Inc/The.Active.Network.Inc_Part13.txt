THINK SUMMARY:                                                                  415-249-1982, bschwartz@thinkequity.com
In   selecting   our   2012   "Fab   Four",   ACTV,   KNXA,   LPSN,   &   ULTI   scored
exceptionally well in five critical areas: SaaS business model, horizontal solutions,
high  scarcity  value,  Enterprise-wide  deployments  and  a  cost-savings  value
proposition. On an application segment basis, we remain most bullish on the
Talent Management sector owing to its strong secular and cyclical trends and top
segment rank scoring among our five critical areas.

KEY POINTS:
In choosing our "Fab Four" ideas for 2012, we evaluated a dozen small, mid and
large cap Enterprise software companies that we follow in the following five critical
areas and selected companies that we viewed as strong in all five categories:
Company-specific secular trends and brief snapshots are located on page 2.
1. SaaS  business  model.  We  are  seeing  a  monumental  shift  occurring  in
Enterprise  Software  as  CIOs  transition  from  legacy,  client  server  software
infrastructure  to  SaaS  platforms.  Although  many  Enterprises  are  still  buying
software in the traditional, on-premise format, we prefer the predictability, stability,
and faster innovation cycles of the SaaS business model.
2.  Horizontal  solutions.  The  ability  to  sell  to  almost  any  size  organization
or industry vertical with little to no customization makes it easier to add new
customers and provides diversification from vertical slowdowns (i.e., such as the
current Housing industry is experiencing). This can also lead to higher operating
margins from lower C.O.G.S. and R&D requirements.
3. High scarcity value. With organic growth rates slowing among most of the
largest Enterprise software companies, it is logical to assume an organic growth
challenged large software vendor will attempt to identify a unique technology
asset and consider acquiring them as one of their eventual options.
4. Enterprise-wide deployments. Solutions that are adopted by every employee
increases  stickiness,  demonstrates  scale,  and  should  provide  better  data
analytics capabilities for the Enterprise than solutions sold solely into divisions. In
our view, pervasive usage makes a more compelling case for CIOs to standardize
on an Enterprise-wide platform and procure additional solutions over time from
this type of vendor than a divisional platform. This is not to say that companies
can not generate strong growth simply by selling into divisions. Years ago, who
would have ever envisioned salesforce.com becoming a $15B company simply by
selling salesforce automation software to the sales and marketing departments.
However, if divisional solutions never gain adoption Enterprise-wide than they
lack a compelling case around data integration and analytics, in our opinion.
Additionally, vendors solely selling into divisions will likely eventually succumb to
market saturation and risk a slow descent in their new business growth rates as
available runway shrinks.
5. Cost savings value proposition. Though we have no call on the global
macro outlook, clearly there are heightened concerns around slowing growth
rates among the BRIC economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We
recently experienced elements of a more cautious IT buyer and elongated sales
cycles in our November/December field checks, and from recent new business
results from industry bellwethers such as Oracle and salesforce.com. In a slowing
macro environment the IT buyer tends to be more focused on a quick ROI. And
we believe it is easier to validate a quick ROI with a cost-savings solution than a
demand generation solution, in most cases. Thus winning new business with a
demand generation value proposition tends to be more vulnerable to customer
business cycles in this type of macro backdrop, in our opinion.

KEY COMPANY-SPECIFIC SECULAR TRENDS

ACTV: SaaS-based online registrations lifecycle management platform is imperative in our view for events management
organizations  to  increase  participation  rates  and  enhance  customer  service;  shift  from  offline  to  online  registrations,
transactions and advertisement

KNXA: Skilled labor shortages; higher employee attrition; automating and outsourcing HR department requirements

LPSN: Real-time customer behavioral analysis are essential in our view for effective online selling and customer support

ULTI: SaaS payroll is starting to tip into the Enterprise market = larger deal sizes & improved revenue visibility; automating
HR department requirements

                                                                                                 Industry Report

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGETS

ACTV: Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 18x EV/
EBITDA multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $54M. We assume ACTV maintains a similar valuation multiple and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is in the middle of
our 15-20% long-term CAGR expectation.

KNXA: At approximately 14x our EV/FTM OCF estimate of $43M, we believe KNXA is one of the more attractively valued
stocks in our SaaS software universe. On an EV/2012E revenue basis, KNXA shares trade at just 2.1x versus the SaaS
companies group average of 4.3x. The stock also trades at a noticeable discount to the 2.9x group average on an EV/2012E
revenue basis for our Non-SaaS application companies. Our $32 price target is based on our assumption that the shares will
trade at 2.4x EV/2012E revenue, which we think is appropriate, as it is a noticeable discount to the SaaS group average. We
think KNXA shares should continue to trade at a discount to the SaaS group average owing to its higher services revenue mix
than most SaaS vendors. However, we don't think the shares should trade at a discount to the Non-SaaS group average due
to the higher visibility of its subscription model and faster organic revenue growth, cash flow growth and EPS growth than the
Non- SaaS group average, but we use a slight discount group average multiple to the Non-SaaS group to be conservative.

LPSN: Currently, LPSN shares trade at approximately 21x our EV/FTM cash from operations estimate of $29M, which is below
the entire SaaS group average of 27x. Our $14 per-share price target for LPSN shares is based on 23x our EV/2012 cash from
operations estimate of $31M, as we assume that LPSN will maintain essentially a similar valuation multiple in the out year and
we believe this multiple to be appropriate and conservative since we think that LPSN shares warrant at least a group average
multiple because of what we believe is LivePerson's leading market positioning in the Customer Intelligent Engagement market
and higher profitability profile than most other SaaS providers.

ULTI: ULTI currently trades at 5.3x our EV/FTM Rev estimate of $312M, which is a premium to the current SaaS Group average
of 4.3x. Our valuation analysis yields a $63 per-share price target for ULTI shares, which is based on 5.1x 2012E EV/ Rev. We
assume ULTI will maintain a slightly more conservative valuation multiple in the out-year and believe this multiple is appropriate
since historically ULTI trades at ~5x Ev/Rev.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGETS

ACTV: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4) failure to demonstrate
leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

KNXA: 1) Prolonged weakness in IT spending; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increase in customer churn; 4) slow customer
adoption of talent management software; 5) rising unemployment; 6) acquisition integration challenges; 7) competition.

LPSN: 1) Competition. The above-average industry growth and increasing strategic value of customer intelligent solutions
could attract the attention of larger software players. These larger software companies could then leverage the scale of their
business, and size of their customer bases, to price competing solutions aggressively; which could make new customer
additions and growth more challenging for LivePerson. 2) Macroeconomic fluctuations. LivePerson, like most other software
companies, are exposed to changes in customer demand caused by macro fluctuations such as a recession. Any significant
downturn in the economy most likely would result in a tightening of corporate IT budgets that could cause customers to defer
investing in customer intelligent solutions. 3) Increased churn. SaaS companies are focused on customer renewals to sustain
the business models. If renewals dip below historical levels, growth will become more of a challenge. 4) Legal Risk. The
company is currently involved in two patent infringement litigation suits. While we can not predict the ultimate outcome of
any legal proceedings, the suits could cause new customers from deferring purchases of LivePerson or existing customers
canceling service as a result of these cases. Additionally, there could be monetary damages that could have an adverse effect
on the companys financial position. The company has not accrued any monies for these cases as they believe the cases are
without merit and any amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
