Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                                EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

Company Description 
 
Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Executive Summary 
 
TLLP is a high-quality MLP with (1) 100% fee-based       cash flow, (2) a conservative capital structure that 
provides the flexibility to pursue grow th objectives, and (3) a strong GP that is a source for organic and drop-
down acquisition opportunities, in   our view. We have forecasted a five   -year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, 
assuming average annual (1) acquisitions of $100 million and (2) growth capex of $25 million. TLLP is likely to 
trade at a premium to other small-cap pipeline MLPs, in  our view, given the following factors: (1) the fact that 
it offers investors an attractive way to participate in  the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale infrastructure, (2) 
the partnerships above-average multiyear growth outlook, and (3) TLLPs low-risk business model. We believe 
key investment highlights and considerations include the following: 
 
•   A play on infrastructure development in the Bakken shale.  Revenue from this emerging play is 
    expected to account for 53% of the partnerships tota l revenue projected for the 12 months ending March 
    31, 2012 (S-1 guidance). Several larger MLPs are investing in the Bakken Shale, but the potential upside is 
    less impactful, in our view, given th  e relative size and geographic diversity of these partnerships. We 
    anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the    Bakken to be a driver of organic growth for the 
    partnership over time. 
 
•   Visible organic growth outlook   . Excluding acquisitions, our to         tal growth capex forecast of 
    approximately $133 million in 2011-16 could support a 6.0% distribution CAGR over the next five years. 
    TLLP has earmarked $15.5 million of  growth capex over the next two years. Incremental cash flow from 
    these projects is expected to result in an 18% year-over-year increase in EBITDA for the 12 months ending 
    March 31, 2013.  
 
•   Upside could come from pote  ntial drop-down acquisitions . Our five-year distribution CAGR 
    forecast increases to 9.1% assuming $100 million of      acquisitions annually. TSO still has a sizeable 
    portfolio of logistics assets, which the partnership coul d acquire over time to augment distribution growth 
    and potentially more than double its size. TSO still owns and operates three additional terminals, two 
    pipelines, and five marine terminals outside of the partnership. 
 
•   A relatively low-risk business model and stable cash flow. TLLP derives 100% of its revenue from 
    fee-based contracts. In addition, the partnership    s stable cash flow is underpinned by ten-year 
    terminalling, transportation, and storage agreements, and ten-year minimum volume commitments for all 
    of its assets. 
 
•   Strong balance sheet.  With $50 million of debt outstanding  and $100 million available (and a $150 
    million accordion feature) on its credit facility, the partnership has the financial flexibility to pursue 
    organic growth and acquisitions, in our view.  
 
•   Customer and geographic concentration risks.  The partnership relies on TSO as the key customer 
    for all of its assets (approximately 93% of pro fo rma 2010 EBITDA) and a source for potential drop-
    downs. Consequently, the partnership is highly dependent on TSOs refining operations, midstream 
    investments, and financial position, in our view. In a ddition, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from 
    its operations in the Bakken Shale (about 53%).

Partnership Formation, Initial Public Offering, And Structure 
 
In December 2010, Tesoro Corporation (TSO) formed TL         LP to own, operate, and invest in crude oil and 
refined products logistics assets. In connection with TLLPs initial public offering (IPO), TSO contributed 
certain crude oil and refined product logistics assets to  the partnership in exchange for a 2% general partner 
(GP) interest, a 56.2% limited partner (LP) interest, an d the incentive distribution  rights (IDR). TLLP began 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 20, 20 11. Approximately 42% of the partnership was sold to 
the public via the issuance of 13 mi llion units priced at $21.00 per unit.  The overallotment of 2 million units 
was exercised in full, which increased  public unit holders LP interest to  48.0% (15 million units) from 41.8% 
and reduced TSOs LP interest to 50.0% from 56.2%.

Currently, there are 15.3 million common units and 15.3 million subordinated units outstanding. The latter 
class of units is all held by TSO. In total, TSO owns a limited partner (LP) interest of 50.0% and a 100% 
interest in the partnerships general partner Tesoro Lo gistics GP and the IDRs. Mana gement estimates that at 
least 80% of TLLPs annualized distribution of $1.35 per unit is tax deferred through December 31, 2013. 
 
TLLPs limited partner interest is  divided between two tranches of eq uity: common units and subordinated 
units (both 50% of total LP units). The key differences  we perceive between common and subordinated units 
are as follows: (1) subordinated units are not entitled  to receive any distributions until the common units have 
received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters during the subordination 
period and (2) subordinated units do not accrue arrearages. Typically, an MLP will fund short-term 
distribution shortfalls through its revo lving credit facility, but may opt to   halt distributions to subordinated 
unit holders if coverage is expected to fall below 1.0x for an extended period of time. Hence, subordinated units 
act as a cushion for common unit holders, providing additional distribution security.  
 
TLLPs subordinated units are eligible to convert to common units on a one-to-one basis beginning on June 
30, 2014, assuming the partnership has paid an annualized distribution of at least $1.35 per unit for three 
years. Alternatively, subordinated  units are eligible for immediate conv  ersion assuming TLLP has paid an 
annualized distribution per unit in excess of $2.025 (150.0% of the annualized minimum quarterly 
distribution) for a period of four consecutive quarters.

Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                               EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

GP Sponsor Supports Growth From Acquisitions And Stability In Cash Flow 
 
Tesoro Corporation (TSO). TLLPs strategic relationship with its GP sponsor Tesoro Corporation enhances 
the partnerships growth prospects, in our view. TSO serv es as a strong partner to jointly pursue third-party 
acquisitions and as a source for potential drop-down ac  quisitions. TSO has a sizeable portfolio of logistics 
assets, which the partnership could acquire over time to augment distribution growth. As TLLPs largest 
customer, TSO also supports stability in the partnershi ps cash flow through its long-term transportation, 
terminalling, and storage agreements with minimum volume commitments. 
 
Management has stated its intent to use the MLP vehi     cle to build Tesoros logistics business. This could 
include potential joint bids for refining and logistics assets by TSO and TLLP.   TLLP should benefit from 
gaining exposure to deal flow that would normally be unsuitable for an MLP (e.g., package sale of refining and 
logistics assets). By pursuing acquisitions jointly,  the companies could potentially  consummate a transaction 
and divide the assets between the two entities based on   operational fit and relative risk profiles. Specifically, 
midstream properties would be more appropriate for TLLP, while retail or marketing-related businesses would 
be better suited for TSO. 
 
Tesoro Corporation is one of the leading independent refining companies in the United States. The company 
operates seven refineries primarily located in the Western United States with total refining capacity of 664,500 
barrels (bbls) per day. In addition to refining assets,   the company has a network of  880 retail stations in 15 
states that sell transportati on fuels primarily under the  Tesoro, Shell, USA Gasoline, and  Mirastar brands. 
Founded in 1968, TSO was originally  focused on the exploration and produc tion of crude oil. In 1969, TLLP 
purchased its first refinery near Kenai, Alaska. During the 1990s, TSO began to focus on its petroleum and 
marketing businesses and sold non-core assets including its exploration and production operations. From 1998 
to 2002, TSO acquired refineries in Hawaii, Washingt  on, North Dakota, Utah, and California. In 2007, the 
company acquired the Los Angeles refinery and 278    Shell-branded retail stations from Shell Oil Products. 
During this ten-year period, TSO increased its total refining capacity to 664,500 bbls per day from 72,000 bbls 
per day. The company is now the second-largest independent refiner and marketer in the United States, with 
an enterprise value of approximately $5 billion. 
 
TSOs long-term debt is currently ra ted Ba1 and BB+ by Moodys and Standa rd and Poors, respectively, with 
Stable outlooks. While TSOs debt ratings are one notch below investment grade, the companys credit metrics 
appear to be in line with those of other refiners and  its liquidity has improved significantly since the economic 
recession in 2008-09. As of Q1 2011, TSOs debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0x (versus the median of 2.2x for other 
refiners) and its net debt-to-EBITDA ra tio and debt-to-capitalization ratio we re 1.2x and 37%, respectively. As 
of March 31, 2011, the company had almost $1.7 billion of  available liquidity consisting of $742 million of cash 
and $974 million undrawn on the companys revolving credit facility.

Why Was Tesoro Logistics Partners Created? 
 
An MLP provides TSO with a number of benefits, including the following: 
 
•   A tax-advantaged structure with which to  increase Tesoros logistics assets.  Tesoro Logistics 
    Partners provides a platform for TSO to build its logi stics business and maximize the integrated value of 
    its midstream and downstream assets . In addition, an expansion of Tesoros logistics franchise should 
    enable TSO to diversify its asset base (e.g., mitigate its exposure to refining fundamentals).  
     
•   A premium valuation on midstream assets.   Historically, assets within an MLP structure have 
    traded at higher valuations in the market than those same assets would within a corporate structure. For 
    example, small-cap pipeline MLPs are currently tr     ading at a median enterprise value (EV)-to-2012 
    adjusted EBITDA multiple of 10.4x, versus 4.8x for North American refining companies.  
 
•   The opportunity to maintain control of the assets while participating in the upside potential 
    of the incentive distribution rights.  
 
•   Another financing vehicle.  TLLP provides TSO with a source of lower-cost equity with which it can 
    finance logistics-related growth. Historically, MLPs  have had good access to the capital markets, which 
    could help facilitate growth of the overall entity. 
 
Investment Highlights 
 
A Play On Infrastructure Development In The Bakken Shale 
 
TLLP offers investors an attractive way to participate  in the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale infrastructure. 
Crude oil gathering revenue from this region (i.e., the High Plains System) is expected to account for 53% of 
the partnerships total revenue projected for the 12 mont hs ending March 31, 2012 (S-1 guidance). There are 
several larger MLPs that are investing in the Bakken Shal e, but their potential upside  is less impactful, in our 
view, given the relative size and geographic diversity  of these partnerships. TLLP owns a crude oil gathering 
system tied to production from the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin. The High Plains System includes 700 miles 
of pipeline with the capacity to de liver up to 70,000 bbls per day to TSO s Mandan, North Dakota refinery and 
trucking operations that gather about 23,000 bbls per day of crude oil from the region.  
 
We anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the  Bakken Shale to be a driver  of organic growth for the 
partnership over time. TLLP already has committed to one project (i.e., an expansion of its High Plains System 
by Q2 2012 to accommodate the capacity addition at  TSOs Mandan refinery). The partnership has identified 
other potential opportunities that   have not been incorporated in it     s S-1 guidance. At this juncture, 
management has not quantified the potential amount of investments. For modeling purposes, we have 
assumed growth capex of $25 million   annually in 2012-16, which may prove to be conservative. TLLPs 
potential projects in the Bakken Shale include the following: 
 
•   Expansion of the High Plains System through the cons truction of additional gathering lines to access new 
    drilling locations. 

•   To establish additional outlet connections between the High Plains System and third-party regional 
    pipelines, which would increase optionality for sh  ippers and capture increm ental third-party volume. 
    Management has identified five potential interconnect  ions that it believes could be accomplished with 
    minimal capital: Enbridges pipelines at Ramburg, North Dakota and Portal at the U.S./Canadian border, 
    and True Companies Bridger pipeline at Richey, Mont ana, Belle Fourche pipeline at Fritz, North Dakota, 
    and Little Missouri pipelines at Fryburg, North Dakota. 

•   Increase High Plains Systems throughput capacity with additional pumping capacity. 

•   Construction of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan refine ry to increase the Williston Basin takeaway capacity 
    for crude oil.  
 
The Bakken Shale is one of the major emerging oil plays in North America. It is a key crude oil resource with 
approximately 4.0-6.3 billion bbls of recoverable reserv es (including the underlying Three Forks formation), 
according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral       Resources. This compares  with total U.S. proved 
reserves of 19.1 billion bbls. The Bakken play is a formation in the Williston Basin, which is spread across parts 
of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Canada. Development in the Bakken Shale has accelerated given 
the favorable crude oil price environment, advancements in drilling technologies, and E&P companies focus 
on liquids-rich areas due to more fa  vorable economics. Specifically, the rig count tied to the play in North

Upside beyond organic growth could  potentially come from acquisitions.  We forecast a five-year 
distribution CAGR of 9.1% predicated on assumed acqu isitions of approximately $500 million in 2012-16 (or a 
$100 million transaction each year) completed at an EBITDA multiple of 10x and average annual growth capex 
of approximately $25 million during that period. Potential acquisitions will likely be a mix of drop-downs from 
TSO and third-party acquisitions, in our view. 
 
The actual economics of a potential drop-down will likely   be a function of the orga nic growth profile of the 
acquisition target and the maturity of  TLLP as an MLP. For example, a higher  acquisition multiple is likely for 
TSOs terminals with more volume upside due to (1) a favorable demand outlook for petroleum products in the 
region, (2) a less competitive market,  (3) access to multiple sources (refin eries), and/or (4) enhanced service 
capabilities available. In addition, as the partnerships earnings base grows and a higher percentage of 
distributions are paid to the GP, it becomes more cha      llenging to consummate accr etive acquisitions, in our 
view. Accordingly, TSO may elect to reduce drop-down multiples in the outer years to ensure that the 
transaction benefits both TLLPs GP and LP unit holders. We view TLLPs potential drop-down opportunities 
as a competitive advantage given that they provide a built-in growth platform and eliminate the need to 
compete for third-party acquisitions.

The pool of potential drop-down assets should increase        as TSO continues to invest in logistics assets. In 
addition, management intends  to use TLLP as a vehicle to pursue th  ird-party acquisitions. Accordingly, our 
distribution growth forecast could pr ove conservative if the size and/or  timing of acquisitions consummated 
exceeds expectations. To note, the assumed EBITDA of         $50 million for our acquisition forecast in 2012-16 
compares with estimated cash flow of $66-68 million   from TSOs current remaining portfolio of midstream 
assets (see pages 10-11 for details). 
 
All else being equal, we forecast th at a $50 million increase or decrease  in our assumed acquisition spending 
estimate will increase or decrease our five-year distribution CAGR by roughly 1-2%, depending on the EBITDA 
multiple assumed (i.e., lowe r multiples imply higher gr owth leverage from acquis ition spending). Figure 5 
illustrates the sensitivity of our distribution growth fore cast to varying levels of  assumed acquisition spending 
and EBITDA multiples. Key assumptions used in this analysis are as follows: 
 
•    Acquisition multiples in the range of 9-11x EBITDA.  
•    Maintenance capex of approximately 9% of EBITDA, which is in line with TLLPs guidance for the 12 
    months ending March 31, 2012. 
•    Acquisitions in 2012 financed 100% with debt given that TLLP currently has only $50 million of debt 
    outstanding. We estimate 50% debt and 50% equity  financing thereafter. Finally, we assume a long-term 
    average interest rate of 6.75% and yield of 6.25% for the equity portion of the financing.

Drop-down of TSOs remaining logistics a  ssets could double the size of TLLP.    Based on an 
acquisition multiple of 10x EBITDA, we estimate a  pproximately $660-680 million  of immediate drop-down 
potential for TLLP. Management has not disclosed the earnings generated by TSOs remaining portfolio of 
midstream assets. However, it did note that the aggregate gross book value of TSOs retained logistics assets 
was $240 million as of December 31, 2010. This compares with the gross book value of $193 million for the 
assets currently in TLLP. Assuming that the relative gross book values are proportionate to cash flow, EBITDA 
of potential drop-down assets could approximate $66        million. Alternatively, we estimate EBITDA of  
$68 million for TSOs remaining portfo lio of midstream assets based on   the assets average throughput in 
2009 and 2010, estimated market-based rates, and margins in line with TLLPs S-1 guidance. Our assumptions 
include (1) average volume in 2009 and 2010 for TS   Os pipelines and terminals and the maximum storage 
capacity; (2) a transportation rate of  $0.61 per bbl for TSOs Alaska Pipeline based on its published tariff, (3) a

Entitled to right of first offer fo r future TSO midstream divestitures.  For a period of ten years after 
its IPO, TLLP has a right of first offer to acquire certai  n logistics assets if TSO decides to sell them. Potential 
drop-down assets include three terminals, two pipelines, and five marine terminals located in Alaska, 
California, and Washington. Please refer to the Appendix (pages 38-42) for descriptions of these assets. Having 
the right of first offer on substantially all of TSO           s potential midstream divest  itures should mitigate 
competition with third parties for futu re acquisition opportunities, which we  view as a significant benefit for 
the partnership. 
 
TLLP Has A Relatively Low-Risk Business Model And Stable Cash Flow 
 
100% fee-based revenues with no direct commodity exposure.   TLLP derives 100% of its cash flow 
from fee-based, transportation, terminalling, and storag e contracts with limited volumetric risk (see pages 12-
14 for details on minimum volume commitments). Essent  ially, the partnership receives a fee per unit (bbl) 
handled by its gathering system, terminals, pipelines, and/or storage assets. It does not take title to the 
product it handles and has no direct exposure to the pric e of crude oil or refined products. Accordingly, TLLPs 
cash flow should be relatively stable, in our view.   While the partnership has no direct commodity exposure, 
changes in commodity prices can ultimately affect the partnerships volume. For example, if crude oil prices 
were to decline significantly, the development of the  Bakken Shale could slow down. Consequently, a decrease 
in producer drilling activity in the region could lower  TLLPs future gathering throughput, thereby, decreasing 
cash flow.

TLLPs 100% fee-based cash flow compares favorably   with that of other small-cap pipeline MLPs. For the 
small-cap pipeline MLP subsector, fee-based cash flow   accounts for approximately 83% of total cash flow. 
Notably, large-cap pipeline MLPs and gathering an     d processing MLPs currently obtain 82% and 55%, 
respectively, of their cash flow from fee-based operations. 
 
Long-term commercial agreements with TSO bolster stability of cash flow. TSO is the partnerships 
primary customer and accounted for 93% of TLLPs pro forma 2010 EBITDA. The company is expected to 
account for 97% of the partnerships revenue for the 12  months ending March 31, 2012, compared to 96% of 
pro forma 2010 revenue. Notably, TLLPs contracts wi  th TSO are long-term in nature. For the High Plains 
System, TLLP entered into a ten-year crude oil gath    ering and transportation agreement and a two-year 
trucking transportation services agreement with TSO, which is the primary shipper on the system. In addition, 
TLLP secured a ten-year services agreement for all eight of its terminals and ten-year transportation and 
storage contracts for its assets in Sa lt Lake City. All ten-year agreements  may be renewed for two additional 
five-year terms at TSOs option. The trucking contract  will automatically be extended for successive two-year 
terms, up to a maximum of ten years. These long-term agreements should provide the partnership with a 
reliable stream of cash flow into the future, in our view. 
 
Ten-year minimum volume commitments also  mitigate volatility of cash flow.   Unlike for many 
other midstream operators, TLLPs volumetric risk is limited through a minimum volume commitment feature 
in all of its agreements with TSO. Th is feature should mitigate the sensitiv ity of the partnerships cash flow to 
variability in throughput volume for the first ten year  s of the partnerships existence. Notably, management 
estimates that 84% of TLLPs projecte d revenue for the 12 months ending  March 31, 2012, is supported by its 
minimum volume commitments (i.e., $81.7 million out of $97.3 million). This implies that TLLPs distribution 
coverage ratio would approximate 0.73x (cash flow deficit of $11.4 million) if  the partnership realized only the 
minimum volume during that time frame and did not realize a commensurate decrease in operating expenses. 
 
For the High Plains System, TSO has agreed to transport an average of at least 49,000 bbls per day of crude oil 
per month at the committed rate (i.e., $1.11 per bbl) from North Dakota origin points to TSOs Mandan refinery 
for a period of ten years. If applicable, TSO agrees to pay TLLP a shortfall pa  yment equal to the volume 
shortfall during a calendar month, mu ltiplied by the weighted average committed tariff rate paid by TSO for 
that month. The shortfall payment is  to be credited against amounts owed by TSO in excess of its minimum 
throughput commitment during any of the succeeding three months. Any remaining portion of the shortfall 
credit expires following the three-month period.  
 
Notably, TLLPs North Dakota pipeline throughput averaged 46,004 bbls per day in 2010. According to the S-1 
filing, management believes North Dakota pipeline  volume will approximate 54,200 bbls per day for the 12 
months ending March 31, 2012, which is above the     minimum volume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 
North Dakota pipeline throughput forecast, we believ  e that actual throughput will be above the minimum 
volume commitment each year. Consequently, our model does not reflect the impact of any shortfall payment 
adjustments.

TSO and TLLPs High Plains trucking transportation                services agreement provides for a minimum volume 
commitment of 22,000 bbls per day per month and a transpor tation fee of $2.72 per bbl for two years. TLLPs 
trucking volume averaged 23,305 bbls per day in 2010. Management anticipates volume to approximate 
22,900 bbls per day for the 12 months ending Marc                   h 31, 2012, which is above the minimum volume 
commitment. We anticipate actual trucking volume in 2011-16 to exceed the minimum threshold.

For TLLPs eight refined products te rminals, TSO has agreed to an aggregate average throughput minimum of 
100,000 bbls per day, per month at an av erage terminalling fee (i.e., $0.81 per bbl) for a period of ten years. If 
applicable, TSO agrees to pay TLLP a shortfall payment  equal to the volume shortfall during a calendar month 
multiplied by the weighted average throughput fee incurred by TSO for that month. The shortfall payment is to 
be credited against amounts owed by TSO in excess of  its minimum throughput commitment during any of the 
succeeding three months. Any remaining portion of the shortfall credit expires following the three-month 
period.  
 
TLLPs 2010 refined products terminal throughput averaged 113,950 bbls per day. According to the S-1 filing, 
management believes terminal volume from TSO will approximate 105,800 bbls per day for the 12 months 
ending March 31, 2012, which is above the minimum vo lume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 total refined 
products terminal throughput foreca st, we believe that actual throughput will be above the minimum volume 
commitment each year. Consequently  , our model does not reflect the                      impact of any shortfall payment 
adjustments.

For TLLPs Salt Lake City assets, TSO has agreed to tr  ansport an average of at le ast 54,000 bbls per day, per 
month of crude oil and refined products on TLLPs five sh ort-haul pipelines at the transportation rate of $0.25 
per bbl for a ten-year period. If applicable, a volume sh ortfall payment or credit adjustment would also occur. 
In addition, TSO is committed to pay TLLP a $0.50 per bbl  per month fee based on the partnerships Salt Lake 
City storage facilitys shell capacity of 878,000 bbls                    in exchange for storage an            d transportation services 
provided between TLLPs storage facility and TSOs Salt Lake City refinery. 
 
Notably, TLLPs 2010 Salt Lake Ci  ty short-haul pipeline throughput  averaged 60,666 bbls per day in 2010. 
According to the S-1 filing, management believes pipeline volume will approximate 65,800 bbls per day for the 
12 months ending March 31, 2012, which is above th  e minimum volume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 
Salt Lake City pipeline throughput forecast, we believe that actual throughput will be above the minimum 
volume commitment each year. Consequently, our model does not reflect the impact of any shortfall payment 
adjustments.

Annual fee escalators should offset po tential inflationary cost pressures.  The High Plains pipeline 
rate is subject to the Federal Ener                                             gy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in                                                     dexing methodology. Based on the 
formula of PPI plus 2.65%, TLLP should benefit from a 6.8% rate increase in July 2011. TLLPs terminalling 
fees and Salt Lake City transportation  and storage fees are subject to auto matic annual escalators. This should 
help mitigate the impact of potential increases in the partnerships cost structure in the future. The fees are 
adjusted annually by a percentage equal to the change in the consumer price index. Alternatively, if 
management is successful in keeping expenses level, the   annual rate increases should result in modest margin 
growth, all else being equal.  
 
Conservative Capital Structure Provides Flexibility To Pursue Growth Objectives 
 
Strong balance sheet. With only $50 million of debt outstanding  and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0x, TLLP 
has the financial flexibility to pursue organic growth in  itiatives and acquisitions, in  our view. The partnership 
has a $150 million revolving credit facility, which expire s in April 2014, with a $150 million accordion feature. 
This provides TLLP the option to me                                                    aningfully increase its borrowing ca                                               pacity in the future. TLLPs total 
liquidity of $100 million should be more than suffi                                                                           cient to finance its estimated 2011 growth capital 
expenditure of approximately $8 million. 
 
We believe that TLLP will maintain                                                 a strong balance sheet and a relatively                                                   conservative capital structure of 
50% debt and 50% equity over the long term. We foreca st that the partnership could end 2011 and 2012 with a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x and 2.6x, respectively. This                                                                         compares favorably to the median ratio of 4.0x for 
other small-cap pipeline MLPs.

$100 million acquisition assumption in Q1 financed wi                                                                           th 100% debt, which we anticipate the partnership 
would term out in Q2. We forecast                                                 that the partnership could end 2012                                                  with $76 million of liquidity and a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x, which compares with the maximum permitted covenant threshold of 4.0x. 
 
IDR reset option enables management                                                                      to better control co  st of capital.   Like most other MLPs, 
TLLPs general partner has IDRs, which entitle it to re                                                                          ceive an increasing percentage of the partnerships 
distributions as the distribution per unit surpasses certai  n tiers (see Figure 12). TLLP would have to increase 
its minimum quarter distribution (MQD) by 50% to reach the high splits, or 50/50 tier.

Similar to other MLPs, TLLP has an IDR reset option   in its partnership agreement. The reset option gives 
management better control of the partne rships cost of capital over the long term and allows TLLP to better 
compete for acquisitions and/or invest in organic                 projects that would otherwise not be accretive to 
distributable cash flow when the partnership becomes dee  p in the splits, in our view. As stipulated by the 
agreement, the general partner (TSO) holds the right to reset, at higher levels, the minimum quarterly 
distribution and incentive distribution levels. The cumu             lative cash flow accruing to the GP would not be 
altered, but instead, the future cash flow stream is affected.

Specifically, the GP would receive a lower percentage of incremental cash flow at the reset (higher) MQD than 
the 50% of incremental cash flow that it would receive under the initial distribution schedule. Hence, by 
resetting the incentive distribution tiers, the MLPs cost   of equity is effectively reduced. On the basis of our 
distribution growth forecast, the partnership would reac  h the high-splits tier in Q4 2015. From this point 
forward, the GP would begin receiving 50% of the partnerships incremental cash flow. 
 
TSO holds the right to reset the MQD and incentive dist  ribution levels (without the approval of the common 
unit holders) under the following conditions: 
 
•    If there are no subordinated units outstanding, and 

•    If the general partner has received incentive distributions at the highest level, or 48%, for each of the prior 
     four consecutive fiscal quarters. 
 
The GP would receive a certain number of TLLPs co                mmon units and additional   general partner units in 
exchange for resetting the incentive distribution levels. The number of common units received would be 
based on the amount of incentive cash distributions rece  ived for the two consecutive fiscal quarters prior to 
reset.

Overview Of TLLPs Assets  
 
TLLP owns and operates crude oil and refined product logistics assets. Specifically, the partnership owns crude 
oil gathering pipelines and a truck-ba sed crude oil gathering operation ti ed to production from the Bakken 
Shale/Williston Basin (i.e., the High Plains System). The system supplies crude oil to TSOs Mandan refinery in 
North Dakota. In addition, TLLP owns  and operates eight refined product  terminals with associated storage 
facilities located primarily in the Western United States, and five short-haul pipelines and storage assets in Salt 
Lake City, Utah. TLLPs terminalling assets are primarily  tied to TSOs refinery operations and play an integral 
role in helping TSO distribute refined products to market.

We expect TLLPs Crude Oil Gathering Segment (the High Plains System) to account for a significant portion 
of the partnerships cash flow (i.e., 56% of our pro   forma 2011 EBITDA forecast). For the 12 months ending 
March 31, 2012, management expects the segment to account for approximately 53% of TLLPs total revenue. 
TSO plans to expand the capacity at its Mandan refine ry to 68,000 bbls per day from 58,000 bbls per day (i.e., 
a 17% increase in total refining capacity). Concurrently, TLLP plans to spend approximately $6-7 million of 
growth capex on its High Plains system to accommodate              the expected capacity increase by Q2 2012. Excluding 
the impact of potential acquisitions, we believe that the partnerships gathering operations in the Bakken Shale 
will be the primary driver        of growth in the near term (i.e., 58%            of 2013 estimated EBITDA (excluding 
acquisitions), versus 56% of 2011E pro forma EBITDA).

Pipeline operations. Currently, TLLP operates approximately 700 miles of gathering and trunk lines tied to 
the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in North Dakota and                 Montana. The system also has access to Canadian 
crude oil through connections with third-party pipeline s. The partnership gathers crude oil (up to 70,000 bbls 
per day) for shipment to TSOs Mandan refinery in                central North Dakota. TLLPs crude gathering system 
includes the following: 

•    Approximately 143 miles of up to 6-inch injection lines in western North Dakota and eastern Montana,  

•    474 miles of up to 12-inch gathering and trunk lines in Montana and North Dakota, which lead to TLLPs 
     Dunn Center crude storage facility in North Dakota, and  

•    Approximately 88 miles of 16-inch trunk lines, whic  h transport crude oil from  the Dunn Center storage 
     facility to TSOs Mandan refinery

pipeline on the Canadian border (at Portal, North Dakota).  
 
TLLPs pipelines gathered an average of 50,695 bbls per day and 52,806 bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 
2009. Management estimates average pipeline volume of approximately 58,000 bbls per day for the 12 months 
ending March 31, 2012.

Trucking operations.  TLLP also utilizes trucks to gather crud  e oil from wells that are not connected to 
gathering pipelines. Local producers contact TLLP when they have crude oil  ready to be delivered onto TLLPs 
High Plains system. TLLP uses both proprietary and third-party trucks to gather crude oil from nearby wells or 
collection points and deliver onto TLLPs High Plains  system through one of the partnerships 13 proprietary 
truck unloading facilities. TLLPs trucking operation ga thered an average of 23,305 bbls per day and 22,963 
bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 2009. Mana        gement estimates that these trucks will gather 
approximately 22,900 bbls per day of crude oil for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.

Overview of TSOs Mandan Refinery. The Mandan Refinery began operations in 1954 and is located on 
the Missouri River near Mandan, North Dakota on approximately 950 acres. It primarily receives sweet (low 
sulfur) domestic crude oil from the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin, which is transported via TLLPs High Plains 
System. On March 21, 2011, TSO announced a $38 million project to expand the capacity at its Mandan 
refinery to 68,000 bbls per day by Q2 2012 from 58,000  bbls per day. Management has indicated that a larger 
expansion of the refinery would require significant capital requirements for major upgrades and is therefore 
unlikely in the near term. 
 
Over the past three years (i.e., 2008 -10), the Mandan refinerys average total throughput was 52,000 bbls per 
day (utilization of approximately 90%). In 2010, th e Mandan refinery processed approximately 50,800 bbls 
per day of crude oil and other feedstock. The refinerys yields include gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (e.g., 
approximately 60% of total volume), diesel fuel, and jet fuel, as well as heavy fuel oils and liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG). Turnarounds at the Mandan refinery usually occur every six years and typically last one month. 
Mandans last turnaround was completed in May 2010. To note, refineries perform turnarounds periodically to 
perform maintenance and overhaul operations. Turnarounds are also used to inspect and repair equipment.  
 
The primary markets for refined products produced at TSOs Mandan refinery include Minneapolis and St. 
Paul, Minnesota. A majority of Mandans refined products are transported east via NuStars North Refined 
Products Pipelines System, which originates at the Mand an refinery and terminates in Minneapolis. As shown 
in Figure 18, NuStars pipeline ha s multiple terminals in North Dakota and Minnesota. Only 19% of Mandans 
refined products produced are distributed through TLLPs Mandan Terminal.

Overview of the Bakken Shale.  The Bakken and Three Forks are formations in the Williston Basin, which 
spans parts of Montana, North Dako ta, South Dakota, southern Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Canada. The 
Williston Basins crude oil production in December 20  10 averaged 408,125 bbls per day (or 10.6% of total 
domestic onshore production), according to the Nort  h Dakota Pipeline Authority (NDPA). As a reminder, 
TLLPs High Plains System can deliver up to 70,000  bbls per day to TSOs Mandan refinery. Development of 
the Bakken/Three Forks is primarily concentrated in the states of North Dakota and Montana. 
 
The Bakken Shale is one of the most prolific unconventional oil plays in the United States. Favorable crude oil 
prices and advancements in horizontal drilling, frac turing, and completion technologies are prompting a 
reevaluation of earlier assessments of the plays technically recoverable reserve potential. For example, the 
United States Geological Survey (U SGS) performed a study on the Bakken  Shale in 1995 and estimated that 
only 151 million barrels of crude oil   (the midpoint of the range) were technically recoverable. In 2008, the 
USGS updated its assessment of the Bakken Shale and increased its technically recoverable reserve estimate to 
3.65 billion barrels (the midpoint of the range), which represents a nearly 25-fold increase from its previous 
forecast. Estimates of the plays recoverable reserv  es have been trending upward. The North Dakota 
Department of Mineral Resources provided a recoverable  reserve estimate of 4.0-6.3 billion barrels for North 
Dakotas Bakken and Three Forks formations based on      studies conducted in 2008 and 2010. Continental 
Resources, Inc.s (the largest prod ucer in the Bakken Shale, with 865,  000 net acres as of February 2011) 
forecast is even higher (i.e., recoverable reserves of   approximately 24 billion bbls based on todays drilling 
technologies). Notably, these figures compare to total U.S. estimated proven reserves of 19.1 billion barrels.

Since 2005, North Dakota crude oil production has increa sed at a five-year CAGR of 26%, to 306.6 Mbbls per 
day in 2010 from an average of 97.7 Mbbls per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration 
(EIA). In December 2010 (latest EIA data), the states crude oil production averaged 343.9 Mbbls per day, up 
42% year over year from 242.1 Mbbls per day. North Dakota is now the fourth-largest crude oil producing state 
in the United States, up from being the ninth largest fo ur years ago. Montanas average crude oil production in 
December 2010 of 67 Mbbls per day was essentially flat with year ago volume. The states crude oil production, 
which includes volume from other resource plays, averaged 65 Mbbls per day in 2010, versus 90 Mbbls per day 
in 2005.

Due to favorable drilling economics, the Bakken Shale is one of the most actively drilled unconventional shale 
plays in the United States. According to the Land Rig Newsletter, the rig count tied to the Bakken Shale (in 
North Dakota) has increased 130% year over year, to 128 rigs (as of May 6, 2011) from 98 rigs in the 
comparable year ago period. Continental Resources estimates that approximately 3,600 horizontal wells have 
been completed in the Bakken Shale as of February                                        2011 and expects that the current rig count could add 
2,000 horizontal wells annually. The company plans to spend $1.1 billion of growth capital in the Bakken Shale 
in 2011. As of May 12, 2011, the producers with the most rigs operating in the play included Continental 
Resources (i.e., 16 rigs), Hess Corp. (i.e., 16 rigs), Whit ing Petroleum Corp. (i.e., 12 rigs), and Petro-Hunt (i.e., 
6 rigs), according to the Land Rig Newsletter.

The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources forecasts that oil production in North Dakota could reach 
450,000-700,000 bbls per day within the  next 3-7 years. For the  U.S. portion of the Williston Basin, crude oil 
production could ramp up to 550, 000-800,000 bbls per day during the 2015  -2020 time frame, according to 
the state agency. Continental Resources has a more robust  outlook and projects that Bakken Shale production 
could reach 1 million bbls per day by 2015. Takeaway ca                                        pacity out of the Williston Basin projected for 2011 
(i.e., 653,000 bbls per day, includ  ing 418,000 bbls per day by pipeline                                               s and 235,000 bbls per day by rail) 
exceeds current production of 408,125 bbls per day. Howe ver, it appears that infrastructure bottlenecks could 
arise by 2015 if crude oil production                         increases to a level above the projec                         ted total takeaway capacity in the 
region (i.e., 1,070,000 bbls per day, including all potential pipeline and rail expansions).

TLLPs Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage Segment 
 
TLLP also operates eight refined product terminals primarily located in the Western United States, with total 
terminalling capacity of 239,000 bbls per day and storage capacity of 1,627,000 bbls. The terminals are located 
in the states of California, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah,  and Washington. In Salt Lake City, the partnership also 
owns 13 refined product and crude oi    l storage tanks with 878,000 bbls     of capacity and five short-haul 
pipelines, which serve TSOs nearby refinery. 
 
Terminals.  TLLPs  terminals provide distribution, truck load     ing, storage, inventory management, and 
blending services to its cust omers. The partnerships eight  terminals primarily receiv e refined products from 
pipelines connected to TSOs Los Angeles, Martinez, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. 
Revenue is generated largely from th roughput fees for delivering refine d product from TLLPs terminals to 
trucks and barges. TLLP also generates revenue from providing ancillary services such as blending, jet fuel 
filtering, and additive injections at certain terminals.

In 2010, the two terminals with the highest throughput  were Los Angeles (i.e., 35,286 bbls per day) and Salt 
Lake City (i.e., 25,457 bbls per day), which in total represented approximately 53% of TLLPs total terminalling 
throughput. Notably, the aforementioned terminals rece ive refined products directly from TSOs Los Angeles 
(refining capacity of 97,000 bbls per day) and Salt Lake City (refining capacity of 58,000 bbls per day) 
refineries, respectively. TLLPs Anch orage terminal is the largest based  on terminalling capacity (63,000 bbls 
per day or 26% of total), but its volume accounted for only 13% of TLLPs total in 2010 (utilization of 24%).

TLLPs terminals handle gasoline and gasoline blendstock s, 72% of 2010 volume, diesel fuel, 23%, and jet fuel, 
5%. As shown in Figure 25, TSO accounted for nearly all (i.e., 92%) of TLLPs terminal volume in 2010. TLLP 
expects this figure to decrease over time as a result of its efforts to secure additional third-party volume.

Los Angeles, California terminal (terminalling capacity of 48,000 bbls per day).  The Los Angeles 
Terminal was purchased by TSO in May 2007 from Shell  in connection with the acquisition of the Los Angeles 
refinery. The terminal receives gasoline and diesel from TSOs Los Angeles refinery via pipelines. Refined 
products are transported via trucks  and sold to the Los Angeles market. While there is no refined product 
storage at this facility, the Los Angeles terminal does  have 6,000 bbls of ethanol storage capacity and provides 
blending services. 
 
Stockton, California terminal (9,400 bbls per day).  TLLPs Stockton terminal is located northwest of 
San Francisco, California. The terminal receives gasoline and diesel from TSOs Golden Eagle refinery in 
Martinez, California via Kinder Morg ans SFPP Northern California pipeline. Through TLLPs two-bay truck 
loading rack, TSO distributes and sells refined products locally. The terminal has 20,000 bbls and 46,000 bbls 
of diesel and gasoline storage capacity, respectively. TLLP leases the Stockton terminal from the Port of 
Stockton under a five-year lease, which expires in 20    14 and may be renewed for   three additional five-year 
terms. 
 
Salt Lake City terminal (42,000 bbls per day).  In 2001, TSO purchased the Salt Lake City terminal in 
connection with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City re finery from BP. The terminal receives gasoline, diesel, 
and jet fuel through proprietary pipeli nes from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery. The facility has two gasoline 
storage tanks with total capacity of 17,900 bbls. Refined  products are distributed locally and regionally by TSO 
and other third parties through the terminals five-bay truck rack. Approximately 50% of products produced at 
TSOs Salt Lake Refinery are distributed through TLLPs terminal.  
 
Anchorage, Alaska terminal (63,000 bbls per day). The facility is located at the Port of Anchorage. The 
Alaska terminal receives gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel fr om TSOs Kenai refinery via the Tesoro Alaska Pipeline 
(TAPL) and from marine vessels. The terminal has a rail  rack, which has the capability to unload ten railcars 
and provides access to the Anchorage Fueling and Service Corporation (AFSC) jet fuel storage facility. The 
facility also has 883,000 bbls of storage capacity (2 51,500 bbls for gasoline, 99,000 bbls for diesel, 400,200 
bbls for jet fuel, 118,300 bbls for AvGas, and 13,800 bbls  for transmix). Refined products are distributed and 
sold locally by TSO and third parties through (1) TLLPs  two truck racks, (2) third-party barges at the Port of 
Anchorage dock, and (3) TSOs pipeline connected to AF  SCs jet fuel storage facility. Approximately 28% of 
TSOs Kenai refinerys refined products are distributed by TLLPs Anchorage terminal.  
 
Mandan, North Dakota terminal (22,500 bbls per day). The Mandan terminal is located at TSOs 950-
acre Mandan refinery and consists of a truck loading  rack. TSO acquired the Mandan refinery and associated 
terminal from BP in 2001. The Mandan  terminal handles only 19% of the refinerys total yield. The remaining 
product is distributed through NuStar s North Refined Products Pipeline  System. The Mandan terminal does 
not have refined product storage.

Vancouver, Washington terminal (19,600 bbls per day).  The facility receives gasoline and distillates 
from TSOs Anacortes refinery primar ily through the Olympic Pipeline, which is operated by BP. The Olympic 
Pipeline is connected to four refineries in Puget Sound  and transports gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to terminals 
in Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Vancouver, and Portland. The Vancouver terminal can also accept barge 
shipments from the Anacortes refinery  and third parties. The facility   has 298,000 bbls of storage capacity 
(160,000 bbls for diesel, 130,000 bbls for gasoline, and   7,400 bbls for ethanol). TSO leases the Vancouver 
terminal from the Port of Vancouver. The lease expire s in 2016 and may be rene wed for two additional ten-
year periods. 
  
Boise and Burley, Idaho terminals (34,500 bbls per day).    TLLP owns two terminals in Boise and 
Burley, Idaho, which were purchased by TSO in connection with its Salt Lake City refinery acquisition from BP 
in 2001. The Boise terminal receives gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery via 
Chevrons Northwest Pipeline, while the Burley terminal receives only gasoline and diesel. The Boise terminal 
also receives ethanol by truck. The Boise terminal includes eight storage tanks capable of holding 144,000 bbls 
of gasoline, 34,300 bbls of jet fuel, 54,000 bbls of di  esel, 21,000 bbls of ethanol,  and 1,000 bbls of transmix 
capacity. The Burley terminal also has five storag  e racks with 65,900 bbls and 81,000 bbls of diesel and 
gasoline storage capacity, respectively. Refined products are distributed from the terminals via trucks and sold 
locally by TSO. Approximately 41% of total refined prod   uct volume from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery are 
handled by TLLPs Boise and Burley terminals. 
 
Demand Growth In Tesoros Operating Footprint Is Expected To Outpace The U.S. Average 
 
According to the EIAs Annual Energy Outlook (2011)       , U.S. demand for liquid products, i.e., liquefied 
petroleum gases (LPG), motor  gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oils, petrochemical feed stocks, and other, is 
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.5% through 2035 (i.e., based on 2009-2035). Notably, in two 
of the three U.S. regions served by TS Os refineries (terminals), the growth  in regional demand is anticipated 
to exceed the average rate for the United States. The EIA estimates liquids products consumption in the Pacific 
and Mountain regions to grow at average annual rates of 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, to 6.26 quadrillion 
British thermal units (Btu) and 3.07 quadrillion Btu by  2035 (from 5.28 quadrillion Btu and 2.38 quadrillion 
Btu, respectively, in 2009). Demand in the other U.S. region (i.e., the West North Central region, served by the 
companys Salt Lake City assets and terminals in Boise an d Burley, Idaho) is expected to grow by 0.2%, to 2.76 
quadrillion Btu from 2.63 quadrillion Btu. In aggregate, demand in the domestic regions served by TSOs 
refineries is estimated to growth at an average annual rate of 0.6%.

Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                                 EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

Salt Lake City storage facility and pipelines.  TLLP owns crude oil and refined product pipelines and an 
878,000 bbl storage facility, which excl  usively support TSOs 58,000 bbls   per day Salt Lake  City refinery. 
These assets were purchased by TSO in 2001 in connection     with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City refinery 
from BP. TLLPs logistics assets facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products into and out of TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. Approximately 41% of the refine  rys yield is distributed vi a a third-party pipeline to 
TLLPs Burley and Boise Terminals. Further details of TLLPs Salt Lake City assets follow: 
 

•   Crude oil and refined product storage.  TLLP owns 13 crude oil and  refined product storage tanks 
    with total shell capacity of 878,000  bbls. The storage tanks are connected  to TSOs Salt Lake City refinery 
    though four proprietary pipelines. The crude oil storage tanks supply the Salt Lake City refinery, while the 
    refined product storage tanks store the refinerys product yield including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. 

•   Crude oil pipelines.  TLLP owns three crude oil pipelines (8, 10, and 16 inches), which are each 
    approximately two miles long. These pipelines transpor t crude oil from a Chevron  interstate pipeline and 
    Plains All Americans Pacific crude oil pipeline to T LLPs storage facility. Approximately 79% of the Salt 
    Lake City refinerys crude oil feedstock is delivered by TLLPs short-haul crude oil pipelines.  

•   Refined product pipelines.   TLLP also has two (6 and 8 inch)            refined product pipelines, which 
    transport gasoline and diesel three miles from TSOs refinery to Chevrons Northwest Pipeline.  
In 2010, TLLPs Salt Lake City pipe   line throughput averaged 60,666 bbls per day, versus an average of  
62,822 bbls per day in 2009, and the three-year averag  e of 64,126 bbls per day.  Management estimates an 
average throughput of 65,800 bbls per day for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.

Risks 
 
Risks Specific To TLLP 
 
Customer concentration.  In 2010, TSO accounted for 96% of TLLPs total revenue and 92% of the 
partnerships terminalling throughput. Thus, a disruption  to TSOs refinery operations and/or a change in 
TSOs financial position could negatively affect the partnerships cash flow and future growth.

•   Slower-than-forecast drop-downs from TSO.   TLLPs distribution grow th prospects are highly 
    dependent on acquisitions from its GP  sponsor, in our view. If there is a delay in the drop-down of assets 
    to the partnership, TLLPs ability to grow could be slower than forecasted. 
 
•   Geographic concentration in Bakken Shale. Currently, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from 
    its operations in the Bakken Shale region. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2012, TLLPs crude oil 
    gathering system in the Bakken Shale is expected to   account for 53% of total revenue. If TSOs Mandan 
    refinery were to experience any disruptions for a pr  olonged period of time, th is could have a negative 
    impact on the partnerships primary source of revenue. 
 
•   Lower refining margin.  A decrease in TSOs refining margin could materially affect the amount of 
    crude oil and refined products handle d by TLLP. Margin could deteriorate if crude oil (feedstock) prices 
    increase and/or refined product pr ices decrease due to lower demand   (i.e., economic weakness, high 
    unemployment, inventory levels, etc.). Weak refining margin could cause TSO to reduce refined product 
    production at its refineries, which could result in lower throughput volume for the MLPs assets. 
 
•   Declining production. The partnerships crude oil gathering volume is dependent on the production 
    profiles of the Bakken Shale. Lower-than-expected pr  oduction volume, inability to secure incremental 
    volume to offset declining wells, or a decline in drilling activity due to lower crude oil prices or rising costs 
    could negatively affect future earnings and cash flow. 
 
•   Lower commodity prices.  While TLLP currently has no direct co mmodity price risk, a majority of its 
    revenue is tied to the exploration and production operations of producers in the Bakken Shale. Lower 
    crude oil prices could have the potential to dramatically decrease producers drilling activity and 
    consequently, the partnerships throughput volume.

Risks Applicable To All Energy MLPs 
 
•    Legislative risk. The potential for U.S. tax reform, which coul d result in the corporate taxation of pass-
    through entities, is a risk for MLPs. Discussion around  carried interest, derivative legislation, and cap and 
    trade could also result in headline legislative risk.  
 
•    Access to capital markets. MLPs are dependent on debt and equity markets to finance growth projects 
    and acquisitions. A dislocation in either of these mark ets could reduce a partnerships ability to increase 
    distributions, as investments would become more expensive on the margin. 
 
•    A severe economic downturn. Energy demand is closely linked to             overall economic growth. A severe 
    economic downturn could reduce th e demand for energy and commodity  products, which could result in 
    lower earnings and cash flow. 
 
•    Interest rate risk. As evidenced from the period 1998-99, MLPs have generally underperformed during 
    periods of rapidly rising interest rates.  
 
•    Regulatory risk. MLPs are regulated across a number of industries. TLLPs crude gathering assets are 
    subject to state and Federal Energy Regulatory Co  mmission (FERC) regulation s. Increased regulations 
    and standards to address safety and environmental concerns could affect an MLPs ability to grow.  
 
•    Environmental incidents and terrorism.  Many MLPs have assets that have been designated by the 
    Department of Homeland Security as potential terrori st targets, such as pipe lines and storage assets. A 
    terrorist attack or environmental incident could disrupt the operations of an MLP, which could negatively 
    affect cash flow and earnings in the near term. 
 
Valuation 
 
Valuation--$26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on a blend of (1) our thr ee-stage distribution discount model, which assumes an 
8.5% required rate of return and a long-term growth rate  of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow 
multiple of about 15x our 2012 estimate.  
 
Discounted Distribution Model (DDM) Model 
 
Our primary valuation tool is a three-stage distribution  discount model. Our model assumes a required rate of 
return of 8.5%. For our growth estima tes, we have assumed a  five-year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, a second-
stage growth rate of 2.5%, and a pe     rpetual growth rate of 1.25%. The reduction between our second and 
perpetual growth rate assumptions reflect the fact that  eventually 50% of incrementa l cash flow at TLLP will 
accrue to the general partner.

of about 15x to our 2012 distributable cash flow estimate. TLLP currently trades a price-to-2012E DCF multiple 
of 14.3x, versus 10.4x for small-cap pipeline MLPs. Distributable cash flow is defined as the cash available to be 
distributed to limited unit holders after payments ar              e made for maintenance capital expenditure and cash 
distributions to the general partner. 
 
TLLP Versus The Small-Cap Pipeline MLP Peer Group 
 
TLLP trades at a yield of 5.5%, an enterprise value (EV)-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 13.3x, and a 
price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 14.3x. In comparison, small-cap pipeline MLPs trade at a median yield of 
6.8%, an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 10.4x, and a price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 10.4x. 
Notably, on a price-to-DCF-to-growth basis (which is akin to a PEG ratio), TLLP trades at 1.2x, versus 2.1x for 
the peer group.  
 
The drop-down model has proven to be a successful strategy, as evidenced by the premium valuations 
afforded in the market for MLPs with this business mo  del. Investors seem willing to pay a premium for the 
visibility of future growth, in our  view. MLPs that have drop-down opportunities are not reliant on third-party 
acquisitions or on finding internal organic projects to  fuel growth. While the timing of drop-down acquisitions 
is not always certain, the market is clearly ascribing a certain value to the growth visibility afforded by having a 
parent company with significant MLP-able assets, in our view. In addition, we believe there is less 
integration risk with drop-down assets than with third-party acquisitions. 
 
Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (HEP) is a good compar                    able for TLLP, in our view, given its (1) strategic 
relationship with its GP sponsor Holly Corporation (H  OC), which is an independent petroleum refiner and 
marketer (similar to TSO), (2) depe ndence on HOC for throug hput, (3) similar asset ba se (e.g., pipelines and 
terminals), (4) access to a midstream portfolio of drop-down assets, and (5) largely fee-based cash flow.

EV-to-EBITDA definition. When comparing TLLPs value on a basi s of its EV-to-EBITDA multiple, we use 
an adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA generated by the partnershi p is used to support the cash distributions to both 
the limited and general partners. However, enterprise valu e reflects only the interest of the limited partners. 
Therefore, in order to produce an apples-to-apples comparison, we deduct the cash flow accruing to the 
general partners from EBITDA. For example, if a part nership is generating EBITDA of $100 million and $10 
million is accruing to the general partner, we dedu              ct $10 million from EBITDA   in calculating our EV-to-
EBITDA multiple. We believe this is the most appropriate way to adjust EBITDA when comparing it to 
enterprise value. 
 
Projected Yield As A Check 
 
While we rely on a dividend discount model and cash fl  ow multiples as our primary valuation tools, we also 
look at yield as a gut check to our other valuation esti mates. In general, we tend to examine our distribution 
forecast several years out and evaluate whether, based   on our valuation range, the projected yield could be 
reasonable.

Looking out one year and assuming that TLLPs yield      was in a range of 5-7%, TLLP units could be worth  
$21-30 per unit, with 14% downside risk to 21% upside potential from the current market price. The potential 
flaw in this analysis is that our distribution estimates  could be inaccurate (both to the upside potential and the 
downside risk), as the timing and magnitude of potential acquisitions is unknown. 
 
Financial Overview And Model Assumptions 
 
Overview Of 2011 Estimates 
 
For 2011, we have forecasted pro forma EBITDA and DC  F per unit of $52.0 million  and $1.46, respectively. 
Based on our distribution estimate of  $1.35 per unit, we forecast a coverage  ratio of 1.08x in 2011E (or excess 
cash flow of $3.4 million).  
 
Our 2011 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $12.4 million, which consists of the following: 
        Maintenance capex of $4.6 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        Growth capex of $7.8 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 79,967 bbls per day 
        Pipeline throughput of 51,137 bbls per day; 
        Trucking volume of 22,830 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 115,718 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 63,840 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls 
 
TLLP provided Q1 2012 trailing-12-months (TTM) guid ance in its prospectus. The company forecasts EBITDA 
of $52.9 million, which is in line with our forecast of $52.7 million (excluding assumed acquisitions). Figure 33 
compares our Q1 2012 TTM estimates to TLLPs guidance.

Overview Of 2012 Estimates 
 
We have assumed TLLP comp letes a $100 million acquisition at an EB ITDA multiple of 10x in Q1 2012E and 
invests $25 million in growth capex. We have forecasted EBITDA and DCF per unit of $68.1 million and $1.71, 
respectively. Based on our distribution estimate of $1.52 per unit, we forecast a coverage ratio of 1.13x in 2012E 
(or excess cash flow of $6.1 million). Our 2012 distribu tion forecast represents a 12.2% increase over our 2011 
distribution estimate. Excluding ou  r $100 million acquisition assumpti                               ons, we estimate that TLLP will 
generate $58.1 million of EBITDA and DCF per unit of $1.60. 
 
Our 2012 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•    Total capex spending of $131 million, which consists of the following: 
           Maintenance capex of $6.0 million (9% of EBITDA); 
           Growth capex of $25.0 million; 
           Assumed acquisition capex of $100 million; 
•    Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 90,528 bbls per day 
           Pipeline throughput of 67,545 bbls per day  the pr  ojected 18% year-over-year increase reflects the 
            anticipated benefit of 2011-12 growth capex and assumes no material change in pipeline rates; 
           Trucking volumes of 22,983 bbls per day: 
•    Average refined products terminalled of 124,192 bbls per day 
•    Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 68,243 bbls per day 
•    Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls

Overview Of TSOs Portfolio Of Potential Drop-Downs 
 
Following the close of TLLPs initial pu blic offering, TSO still holds a portfolio of logistics assets that it could 
potentially sell to the partnership over time. Approximatel y 45% of TSOs logistics assets (based on book value 
as of December 31, 2010) were contributed in the fo  rmation of the partnership. TSOs remaining logistics 
assets, i.e., TLLP has a right of first offer (ROFO) to acquire, include three product terminals, two pipeline 
systems, and five marine terminals. Similar to TLLPs current asset base, these assets are tied to TSOs refining 
operations (i.e., Anacortes, Kenai, Los Angeles, and Martinez refineries). Notably, TSOs Rocky Mountain 
trucking operation and Hawaii logistics assets (i.e., mooring facility, pipeline, and neighboring refined product 
facilities) are not included in the partnerships ROFO agreement. This is largely due to the less stable cash flow 
profile of the assets.

We anticipate that the initial drop-down could include a TSO refined products terminal or a pipeline given the 
similarity of these facilities to TLLPs existing asset base. Notably, management has indicated that some 
potential drop-down assets could have meaningful additional capex requirements, which would likely preclude 
the MLP from a near-term drop-down. For example, management believes the Golden Eagle Wharf will 
require a significant amount of ca  pex to maintain compliance with     numerous government mandates. 
Management estimates that initial capex investments could exceed $100 million. Thus, we believe that TSO 
would refrain from initially dropping-down the Golden Eagle Wharf and other similar assets that require a 
significant amount of capital investme nts. We expect TSO to hold and develop these assets until they become 
MLP-suitable (i.e., stable, fee-based cash flow). Figure 40 provides an overview of assets which could be sold to 
the partnership over time.

Overview of Tesoros Refineries 
 
Los Angeles, California refinery.  TSOs Los Angeles refinery is loca ted on 300 acres approximately 20 
miles south of Los Angeles. It curre  ntly has a crude oil capacity of 97,000 bbls per day and processed an 
average of 98,800 bbls per day of crude oil and other feed stocks in 2010. TSOs Los Angeles refinery primarily 
produces California Air Resources Board (CARB) gasoline, CARB diesel fuel, conventional gasoline, diesel fuel, 
and jet fuel. The refinery also has the capability to pr oduce heavy fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and 
petroleum coke.  
 
The Los Angeles refinery receives crude oil from (1) TSOs leased marine terminal at the Port of Long Beach 
and (2) third-party pipelines, whic h transport domestic crude from th e San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles 
Basin. Approximately 33% of total refined products prod uced from the refinery are distributed via TLLPs Los 
Angeles terminal. The remainder is transported through third-party refined product pipelines and terminals to 
end users in Southern California, Ariz ona, and Nevada. Notably, a small amount of refined products produced 
from the refinery is shipped to international markets from TSOs Long Beach marine dock.  
 
Martinez, California (Golden Eagle) refinery. The refinery is located approximately 30 miles northeast 
of San Francisco on 2,200 acres in Ma rtinez, California. It is TSOs larg est refinery, with 166,000 bbls per day 
of refining capacity. In 2010, the Ma rtinez refinery processed an averag e of 124,000 bbls per day of crude oil 
and other feedstock. It produces transportation fuels including CARB gasoline, CARB diesel fuel, conventional 
gasoline, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and petroleum coke.  
 
The Martinez refinery receives crude oil from numerous  proprietary and third-party assets. It receives foreign, 
Alaskan, and California crude oil through its two mari  ne terminals, which have access to the San Francisco 
Bay, and third-party pipelines. Martinezs refined pr  oducts are distributed through TSOs two marine and 
refined products terminals, TLLPs Stockton terminal,   and third-party terminals.  Notably, only 6% of the 
Martinez refinerys refined products are distributed through TLLPs Stockton terminal.  
 
Salt Lake City, Utah refinery. TSOs 150-acre Salt Lake City refinery has a refining capacity of 58,000 bbls 
per day. In 2010, the refinery processed an average of 50,100 bbls per day of crude oil and other feedstock. The 
refinery produces transportation fuels (i.e., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel), heavy fuel oils, and LPG.  
 
The refinerys feedstock includes crude oil produced in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Canada. Crude is 
transported to TSOs refinery through Plains All Amer     icans Pacific and Chevrons interstate pipelines. 
Notably, these are the only two crude oil pipelines that  serve Salt Lake City, which has five refineries with 
approximately 190,000 bbls per day of re  fining capacity. In addition to th  ird-party pipelines, the refinery 
receives crude oil through a proprietary Rocky Mounta    in crude oil trucking busi ness. TSO distributes the 
refinerys product to Utah, Idaho, and eastern Washington through TLLP-owned and third-party terminals. 
Notably, TLLPs Boise and Burley terminals receive th  eir refined product volume primarily from TSOs Salt 
Lake City refinery via Chevrons Northwest Refined Prod uct Pipeline. In addition, TLLP owns 878,000 bbls of 
storage capacity and five short-haul pipelines adjacent to TSOs Salt Lake City refinery that transport crude oil 
and refined products to and from the refinery.   
 
Kenai, Alaska refinery.  The Kenai Refinery is located 60 miles  southwest of Anchorage in Kenai, Alaska. 
The Kenai refinery has a current capacity of 72,000 bbls per day and processed 53,400 bbls per day of crude oil 
and other feedstock in 2010. The refinery primarily sour  ces its crude oil from Alaska, but also uses foreign 
crude as feedstock. The Kenai refinery primarily produces gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel, diesel fuel, 
heating oil, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and asphalt.   
 
Located on the Cook Inlet, TSOs Kenai refinery receives crude oil from TSOs proprietary marine terminal, a 
third-party pipeline, trucks, and TSOs 24-mile pipeline, wh ich is connected to the Cook Inlet oil field. Refined 
products are transported through TSOs TAPL pipeline to TLLPs Anchorage terminal and the Anchorage 
International Airport. Refined products are also distributed through TSOs Kenai marine terminal and the Port 
of Anchorage. Approximately 28% of Kenais refined products are delivered to TLLPs Anchorage Terminal.  
 
Mandan, North Dakota refinery. For details on TSOs Mandan Refinery, please refer to page 20. 
 
Anacortes, Washington refinery. The Anacortes refinery is located on  the Puget Sound, 70 miles north of 
Seattle, Washington. The refinery has total processing capacity of 120,000 bbls per day. Notably, the Anacortes 
refinerys naphtha hydrotreater was involved in a fire on April 2, 2010. The refinery was temporarily shut down 
to repair the unit. In November 2010, TSOs Anacortes    refinery resumed operations at planned rates. As a 
result of the fire and subsequent down-time, the Anacortes refinery processed an average of 39,300 bbls per 
day in 2010. The refinery produces gasoline (including CARB gasoline), diesel fuel, jet fuel, heavy fuel oils, 
LPG, and asphalt.

The Anacortes refinery receives most of its crude oil from Kinder Morgans Trans Mountain Pipeline (i.e., 
Canadian crude) and TSOs marine te rminal located at the refinery. Kinder Morgans Trans Mountain is a  
715-mile pipeline, which imports crude oil and refined pr oducts from Edmonton to Puget Sound. The pipeline 
services numerous refineries in the area and has an operating capacity of 300 Mbbls per day. The Anacortes 
refinery distributes refined product via (1) a third-party refined product pipeline, (2) TLLPs Vancouver 
terminal, and (3) TSOs marine terminal to markets in Washington, Portland, the West Coast, and Pacific Rim. 
Approximately 21% of the refinerys refined products are distributed through TLLPs Vancouver Terminal.  
 
West Coast Crack Spreads Have Historically Been At A Premium To The Gulf Coast Spread 
 
Since 2000, the West Coast crack spread (based on  Bloombergs Alaskan North Slope (ANS) Crude Oil 3-2-1 
Crack Spread/U.S. West Coast) has averaged $16.51 per  bbl. The spread has averaged $18.48 per bbl year to 
date and is currently at $13.12 per bbl. Typically, crack spreads widen in to the summer driving season due to 
increased demand. 
 
Notably, the historical West Coast crack spread represents a 117% premium to the average Gulf Coast spread of 
$7.59 per bbl (as measured by Bloombergs WTI Cushing Crude Oil 3-2-1 Crack Spread/U.S. Gulf Coast). The 
variance is even greater when comparing the West Coas t crack spread with the Gulf Coast assuming Louisiana 
light sweet (LLS) crude oil as the feedstock for the latter (i.e., 179% higher than the historical average of $5.93 
per bbl). The current and average year-to-date West Coast crack spreads of $13.12 per bbl and $18.48 per bbl, 
respectively, are significantly above the comparable Gu lf Coast-LLS crack spreads of $6.12 per bbl and $5.27 
per bbl.
