  appreciate the recurring nature of ACTV's revenue stream, in our opinion.    EPS is Non-GAAP
  We think ACTV's revenue model is more recurring in nature with better visibility
  than the Street assumes owing to, what we view as, a sticky customer base
  (~5% annual churn), great products, consistent organic registrations growth
  within the base, high customer satisfaction levels, and a large TAM that is
  lightly penetrated. These model characteristics are very similar to other SaaS
  companies in our coverage universe, which are typically valued on EV/Sales. A
  better appreciation of the underlying value of a highly visible, recurring revenue
  stream like The Active Network's could legitimize a higher valuation for the
  ACTV shares, in our opinion. Bottom line: The recurring nature of ACTV's
  revenue stream, along with solid secular trends, gives us conviction that
  The Active Network is going to be a much larger and more profitable
  company in the future and legitimizes a higher near-term valuation, in
  our opinion.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our new $19 (was $18) price target for ACTV shares is based on the
same EV/EBITDA multiple (i.e., 18x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $56M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the
out year and believe this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple
is below our 20% long-term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 2.2x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50%
discount to the current SaaS companies' group average of 4.4x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based
on 2.2x our EV/2013E revenue estimate of $480M, as we use the same valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV
shares should continue to trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue
mix and lower gross margins than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the
model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.
