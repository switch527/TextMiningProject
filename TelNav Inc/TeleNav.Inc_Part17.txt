                                         our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still undervalued, in our 
                                         view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get better clarity on the business 
                                         model, improved metrics relating to the growth of premium and ad-based navigation

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                     undervalued, in our view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     better clarity on the business model, improved metrics relating to the growth of 
                                     premium and ad-based navigation services, and better visibility into re-accelerating 
                                     revenue and earnings growth. 

                                     Our December 2011 price target of $7.50 is based on an assigned multiple of 5x 
                                     CY12E PF EBITDA of $47.4mn.  Our multiple is based on the communication 
                                     software/services peer group current median multiple of ~7x, but with a discount that 
                                     takes into consideration significant shifts in the competitive landscape (Android 
                                     gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining share in autos). 

                                     Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                             leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
