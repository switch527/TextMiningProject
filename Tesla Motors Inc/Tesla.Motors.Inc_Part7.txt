                    capex in 1Q, we expect Tesla full-year capex to reach 
                    $195m (near the low-end of the companys $190m to 
                    $215m target).  Our 2012 EPS improves to ($2.28) from 
                    ($2.80) previously on changes to the timing of SG&A 
                    and R&D expenses vs. our previous forecasts.  Our free

The ultimate hedge against higher oil?

Cost-benefit methodology behind our xEV model.  We have attempted to determine the financial inflection point for operating 
costs, which is one of the objective factors driving our US xEV demand model. We note that several other factors also drive EV 
demand, some of which are more subjective including image, political will etc. These subjective factors could be even more influential 
than the cost factor in determining xEV demand.  For our model, we assume the average car drives 12,000 miles/year and gets 25 
mpg, and we estimate a weekly gasoline consumption of 8-9 gallons/week. We note that US consumers tend to feel the pain of high 
gas prices between $3.50-$4 per gallon. This means the average consumer would be comfortable spending no more than $30 per 
week on gasoline costs. As part of our xEV model, we have tried to maintain the weekly gasoline/electricity spend at $30 per week by 
substituting more PHEVs and EVs in the car fleet, as gasoline prices get to $5, $6 and higher between now and 2025.

                                                   Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                   uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                   regulations.  For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                   leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                 
                                                   basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                   from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of April 30, 2011) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
