Four avenues to long-term growth 
Beyond its core business Telenav is developing four new growth areas  in-dash 
navigation with auto OEMs ; additions of new carriers  (including T-Mobile US and 
China Mobile); fleet tracking and mobi            le resource management; and mobile 
advertising. Of these, the first three are already generating revenue and short start 
to contribute more meaningf ully in CY11. Mobile advert ising remains a promising 
opportunity, but could take some time to develop fully.  
Valuation & risks 
The chief risk the company faces comes from free alternatives such as Googles 
for-free Navigation service which comes  bundled on many Android phones. While 
a threat, we think Telenav has an advantage   in its close relationship with carriers 
and their ability to offer their service on  a much wider range of handsets including 
feature phones, a market largely overlooked  by other providers. We have valued 
Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 3% perpetual growth rate in 
line with long-term industry growth and  a 12.5% discount rate (using a 5.5% risk 
free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%).

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                 

                                Investment Thesis 

                                Telenav is an emerging provider of mobile location-based services (LBS). LBS offers the 
                                promise of providing value to mobile subscri  bers through the application of Internet data 
                                offerings filtered for the users current geogra phic position. Telenav currently monetizes LBS 
                                by offering a turn-by-turn navigation service v ia wireless carriers for use on a wide variety of 
                                handsets. Wireless subscribers pay for this service through their normal cell phone bill and 
                                have access to a navigation service that provides real-time driving instructions, similar to the 
                                experience on a personal navigation device      (PND). Telenav is also working on further 
                                applications of its technology to other LBS areas. 

                                Consumer navigation is undergoing a rapid tran sformation. The age of paper maps is giving 
                                away to a variety of digital offerings. This began with the advent of PC-based mapping 
                                systems such as Google maps. The next stage  was the rapid growth and commoditization of 
                                the PND market which gave consumers a low-       cost, somewhat portable real-time driving 
                                directions. The next stage of this process will the widespread deployment of real-time driving 
                                offerings on mobile phones. We think these  offerings will be supplied through two channels 
                                 subscription services billed through the carri er, and over-the-top offerings supplied by 3rd
                                                                                                                              
                                parties on smartphones. Telenav is the leader in carrier-billed plans. 

                                TeleNav provides this software as a service (S   aaS) on a white label basis for carriers to 
                                supply under their own brand. Today TeleNav has over around a dozen carrier customers, but 
                                AT&T and Sprint provide the bulk of the co    mpanys customers and revenues.  At AT&T 
                                consumers opt-in to an AT&T Navigation su  bscription paying a monthly recurring revenue 
                                (MRR), while Sprint subscribers typically get acce ss to Sprint Navigation from Telenav via a 
                                bundled plan that covers voice minutes, a data  plan and a few other data services. Telenav 
                                also has agreements to provide service to oth  er carriers including China Mobile, Telcel in 
                                Mexico, T-Mobile USA and several others.  

                                Telenav is benefitting from growing consum     er interest in cell phon  e-based navigation, 
                                improving subscriber trends at Sprint and soli  d operating leverage derived from its SaaS 
                                model. In addition, we think  the company has four other growth legs which should start to 
                                contribute meaningfully in 2011 and beyond. Th    ese include: growth at other carriers; an 
                                enterprise-oriented mobile asset tracking busine ss; in-dash navigation  platforms with auto 
                                OEMs starting with Fords Sync platform; and further out the growth in mobile advertising. 

                                Risks and Valuation 
                                We see two primary sources of risk for Telena  v. The first is their dependence on a small 
                                number of carrier customers for their revenue  . Carriers are known to be very demanding 
                                customers. While we believe Telenavs relationship  with its carrier partners is strong, the risk 
                                exists that these carriers source navigati  on elsewhere or more likely pressure Telenav to 
                                bring down its prices. A second, related risk is   competition from OTT navigation providers. 
                                The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet landscape 
                                including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These th ree all offer comparable navigation services 
                                bundled with their mobile operating systems (O S) at no cost to carriers or consumers. We 
                                think Telenavs relationship with the carriers   shield them to some degree from this 
                                competition, but long-term expect pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. 

                                We have established a $12 price target for Tele nav. Our valuation is based on a discounted 
                                cash flow analysis using a 3% perpetual growth ra te in line with long-term industry growth 
                                and a 12.5% discount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%). 
                                We have also valued our company using comparable companies analysis. At our price target 
                                the company trade at 13 2010E earnings and 11x 2011E earnings. At these levels, the 
                                company would trade at a discount to our coverage universe multiple of 18x 2010E and 14 
                                2011E. We believe this discount fully reflects  the competitive pressure on the company and 
                                the associated risks.

                                Navigation Trends 

                                Navigation has undergone a tremendous change in the past ten years. For thousands of years 
                                finding your way from point to point was t  reacherous or at best inconvenient. Maps were 
                                once closely guarded national secrets that could shape the fate of empires. As people 
                                became more mobile, especially with the intr     oduction of the automobile 100 years ago 
                                consumer use of maps has gone up considerably, but were still largely confined to static, out-
                                of-date pieces of paper. That changed dramatic ally in 1999 with the launch of several online 
                                mapping services including Mapquest and Google  Maps. With this dawn of the digital maps, 
                                navigation became incredibly easy and widespread. 

                                Today, it is hard to find paper maps at all.  This is profound shift, but one which has gone 
                                largely unnoticed as it gradually creeps into ev  eryday life. We see this whole evolution as 
                                similar to what happened with the notion of   time. For centuries this was immeasurable for 
                                most people outside of a small coterie of s    pecialists. Gradually clocks and then watches 
                                become so commonplace that they were woven into   the fabric of daily  life. Similarly, we 
                                think location or position is  becoming yet one more metric that will deliver value in new 
                                ways.  

                                The first step in this process is improved na   vigation systems. Digital maps have become 
                                portable, beginning with the in    troduction of in-dash navigation systems in cars. This 
                                portability accelerated five years ago with      the advent of relatively low-cost portable 
                                navigation devices (PND). The introduction of  low-cost merchant GPS semiconductors from 
                                SiRF brought navigation fully into the realm   of consumer electronics. Today you can buy 
                                PNDs for under $200 that can cover most of th e worlds drivable surfaces. Below we update 
                                our global PND model. Exact counts are difficu lt to come by, but we think the market likely 
                                peaked last year.

                                          One of the difficulties PNDs faced has been                      trying to determine penetration rates. The 
                                          market has typically compared PND  unit sales to estimates of ca r sales or cars on the road. 
                                          By that metric the market looks relatively  underpenetrated, with 2009 PND volumes equal to 
                                          about 6% of cars on the road in the US and                 Europe. However, PND sales in both Europe and 
                                          the US have exceeded auto sales for the past several years. Moreover, we think a better 
                                          metric of penetration is to compare PNDs to auto sales after factoring in-dash systems. Most 
                                          luxury cars today come with some form of in-d  ash navigation system built-in at sale. If we 
                                          strip these out penetration rates appear to be cl                 ose to saturation. We calculate this in the 
                                          chart below. Admittedly, this is not a perfect metric of comparison, as PND purchases are 
                                          made independent of car purchases. Noneth                       eless, we think the trend has significant 
                                          implications.

                                          We do not think the penetration of position                 ing and location systems has come anywhere 
                                          close to peaking. However, we do think the method of distribution is set to move away from 
                                          auto-related channels, particularly the cell phone.

                                          The next evolution of navigation is already                  well underway, with a shift from standalone 
                                          navigation sources to becoming just one more fe ature in the personal data device known as 
                                          the cell phone. 

                                          As with the rest of this proce ss, the shift in cell phones will have multiple steps. The first, is 
                                          the transition of current systems to cell phone   equivalents. This will include navigation and 
                                          mapping features. With time, however, combin                       ing precise positioning   data with mobile 
                                          access to the Internet will open up the field to a far wider range of offerings.  

                                          Companies are searching for new ways to make  money and deliver this value by giving users 
                                          data about things around them. This idea is known as location-based services (LBS). We 
                                          expect to see a wide range of business models  chasing this, and we already seeing dozens 
                                          of start-ups try different approaches. 

                                          As business models evolve, the underlying st                   ate of the industry will make these services 
                                          more readily available to a wider and wider audience. 

                                          The first technical requirement will be data-enabled cell phones. On the following page is our 
                                          global handset model. By our count 88% of the 1. 4 billion phones sold this year will be data-
                                          enabled in some way (EDGE or CDMA 1x and up                         ). This includes high end 2G phones with 
                                          some basic data capabilities, that could arguab ly handle navigation and LBS. Almost half of

                               Competitive Landscape 

                               Inside and Outside the Walls 

                               As navigation moves to the cell phone we ex pect to see a new set of companies providing 
                               navigation services. In the past, navigation   was largely a hardware-base offering either in-
                               dash navigation sourced from auto componen t suppliers or stand-alone PND vendors like 
                               Garmin and TomTom. On phones, navigation  becomes a software feature. Here, we see two 
                               primary sources of competition for Telenav  ot her providers of carrier branded, white-label 
                               navigation SaaS vendors and o ver-the-top third party providers who operate without any 
                               direct relationship with carriers. 

                               White Label Competitors 
                               Until recently, the only way to na vigate in real-time on a cell  phone was to work through the 
                               wireless carriers. Typically, these carriers did not provide the service themselves, but sourced 
                               solutions from SaaS vendors on a white-label basis, meaning the carriers attached their brand 
                               to the service. Qualifying as a  carrier supplier is a grueling  process, and typically on a small 
                               number of companies have the staying power to  provide carrier-grade solutions. As a result 
                               only a small number of companies today offer th  is service to carriers. In the US, there are 
                               effectively only two vendors  TeleNav and Netw orks in Motion which was recently acquired 
                               by Telecommunications Systems (TSYS, not rated). TeleNav is a supplier to AT&T, Sprint and 
                               T-Mobile US, while NIM/TCS supplies Verizon. In Europe and elsewhere there a number of 
                               smaller vendors in various stages of roll-outs . The most prominent of these was Wayfinder 
                               which was acquired by Vodafone in 2009, but has since been shut down. 

                               We believe this white label model is very st icky. There are considerable barriers to entry in 
                               the form of carrier qualification procedures. Furt her, carriers are unlikely to switch vendors 
                               once they have deployed a service. We have heard of instances when one white label vendor 
                               is able to offer significantly lower-priced servic es than an incumbent supplier, but are unable 
                               to gain entry to the carrier an  d displace the incumbent. From a carrier point of view, the 
                               benefit of a slightly cheaper service are far out weighed by the risks of switching. Since 
                               carriers typically operate under   intense regulatory and media   scrutiny any disruption of 
                               service that resulted from a switch would likely draw public reaction. This does not mean that 
                               TeleNav has signed up lifelong customers, but it  does limit the competition in the white label 
                               space to some degree. 

                               Over the Top 
                               An emerging trend is for consumers to seek navi gation and other data services from parties 
                               beyond the carrier. These are often referred to as over the top providers, as in coming over 
                               the top of carrier walled garden service offerings . In general, the over the top vendors only 
                               provide service to relatively open handset platforms, which effectively means smart phones 
                               only. By contrast, white label vendors spend si gnificant resources porting their solutions to 
                               be available on all phones offered by a particular   carrier. In the case of TeleNav, they have 
                               ported their solution to over 500 handsets, wh ich include smartphones and feature phones 
                               which lack a true operating system. 

                               In navigation today we see two classes of ov  er-the-top vendors. The first are independent 
                               developers who provide navigation apps. This  arena is largely limited to phone platforms 
                               with healthy app ecosystems meaning the Apple iPhone. A search on the AppStore for 
                               navigation typically yields aroun d 50 apps offering a  range of navigation  services. The best 
                               selling of these come from PND vendors who have ported their solution to the iPhone 
                               including TomTom and Navigon. The TeleNav solution is available on the iPhone, but we view 
                               this as a small opportunity for the company.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                   

                                The second category of over-the-top navigation  comes from smartphone platform vendors  
                                in particular, Google, Nokia and Microsoft.   All three have their own operating systems for 
                                smartphones, and all three have launched free        turn-by-turn navigation solutions. These 
                                companies have the advantage of vast scale and  the ability to pre-load their applications with 
                                their smartphone OS. The downside  of this is that  their offerings are ty pically only available 
                                on a limited number of handsets. 

                                This approach also raises concerns with carri  ers. Carriers are often wary of letting other 
                                parties get too close to their subscribers. Wirel ess operators today live in fear of becoming 
                                dumb bit pipes who offer commodity access          service at thin margins. While they are 
                                increasingly realizing that they cannot compete wi th Internet companies in many fields, our 
                                sense is that most carriers still feel they ha ve advantages in offering LBS and navigation 
                                services. We believe they are not comfortable giving up this service to other large 
                                companies. To some degree this should give          TeleNav a valuable a  lly in building their 
                                business.  

                                That being said, we see two risks from the over-th e-top providers. The first is that they are 
                                setting prices at zero and this will put pressure  on TeleNav to bring prices down, converging 
                                on free. Carriers have proven that they are willing to pay for a service they see as valuable, so 
                                we do not think this pressure will be intense or  sudden. However, we do expect a gradual, 
                                continual decline in navigation prices. We al  so expect carriers to in  creasingly bundle the 
                                navigation service as part of broader package as  Sprint has done. We will explore this topic 
                                further in a later section. A second, less like  ly prospect, is that the over-the-top providers 
                                succeed in becoming de-facto platforms for the   majority of phones. In particular, we think 
                                Googles Android platform shows some potential on this front. While this possibility exists, it 
                                will only come about after prolonged resistance fr  om carriers, and in that fight the carriers 
                                will need trusted partners like TeleNav to compete.  

                                Pricing Models 

                                Carriers sell TeleNavs services using two diff erent pricing models. The first is the monthly 
                                recurring revenue (MRR) in which consumers opt- in for an additional service paid monthly. 
                                AT&T uses this model. It charges consumers  $10 a month to sign up for navigation. The app 
                                is pre-loaded on most AT&T phones, but consumers  have to pro-actively sign up for it. This 
                                results in a higher per user fee paid to TeleNa v, we estimate this to be around $5 per month 
                                per subscriber. But it also limits the growth of the subscriber base. 

                                The second model is a bundled offering. In th is model consumers buy a bundle of services 
                                from a carrier which includes voice minutes, a  data plan and a small number of data services. 
                                In the case of Sprint, they have been prom       oting their Simply Everything plan which 
                                includes unlimited voice, data and texting for $99. It also includes Sprint TV, a Nascar service, 
                                an NFL service and Sprint Navigation, powered  by TeleNav. In this model consumers have 
                                TeleNav service but may not realize it. Sprint  pays a far lower price per subscriber to TeleNav 
                                here, we estimate this to be below $1 per month per sub. However, it results in a far higher 
                                number of subscribers. Of TeleNavs 14.5 million  subscribers as of March 31, we estimate 
                                that between 12 and 13 million are Sprint customers.  

                                These models reflect differing carrier motives. For MRR, carriers are looking for additional 
                                revenue streams. This has been somewhat successf ul. After traditional voice, text and data 
                                charges, we believe navigation has been on       e of the most popular carrier subscription 
                                services. For bundling, we believe  the primary interest is marketing. Most consumers will 
                                likely be ambivalent about signing up for naviga tion. However, for some the appeal of having 
                                that one extra service may be enough to convin     ce them to sign up for the bundled plan. 
                                Whatever this number is, it makes up for all the others, and thus serves as an effective 
                                marketing tool.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                      

                                 So the trade-off for Telenav is lower prices versus more subscribers. Is it better to get $5 for 
                                 MRR or $1 for a bundle. Given TeleNavs SaaS           model, the cost of each incremental 
                                 subscriber is very low. They have built a da   ta center which carriers a high fixed cost, but 
                                 additional resources beyond that are minimal.  As a result, they have tremendous operating 
                                 leverage. In general, they are better off with bu ndled pricing plans. The elasticity of demand 
                                 in this model such that at $1 per sub they typically get far more than 5 additional subscribers, 
                                 the ratio is probably closer to 12. So while revenue on MRR is higher on a per subscriber 
                                 basis, total operating margin dollars ends up being higher in a bundle.  

                                 The graph below illustrates this clearly. Th is shows subscriber count, average revenue per 
                                 subscriber, operating margin perc entage and total operating ma rgin dollars all indexed for

                                 total subscriber and more importantly total do     llar level TeleNav has   enjoyed significant

                               The shift to SaaS gains steam 

                               The adoption of Software-as -a-Service solutions (and mo re broadly the popular moniker 
                               Cloud Computing) has been well-publicized,   and we estimate the   majority of venture 
                               money spent on software overall (majority in     application software) is now within this 
                               segment. While services-based software remains  relatively early stage, we believe adoption 
                               is accelerating and will be the  largest technological/business  model disruption the software 
                               industry has seen since client-server adoption in the 1980s. 

                               The proliferation of broadband makes it more fe asible to offer software over the web and via 
                               mobile phones. The compelling economics of an on-demand solution have gradually 
                               outweighed security and performance fears that  have previously hindered the market. More 
                               importantly, rapidly evolving business drivers,  which are compartmentalizing legacy business 
                               processes (outsourcing, globalization, a shift  to core-competencies) have made the current 
                               enterprise software model less relevant and are fu eling corporate acceptance of software-as-
                               a-service functionality to cost-effectively diff erentiate from competitors. Finally, momentum 
                               of web services integrations have enabled SaaS  firms to innovate much more quickly than 
                               legacy vendors and lessen the wide functional gap that had plagued immature vendors. 

                               A recently published IDC survey shows that comp anies expect, on average, 20% of their IT 
                               budgets will be earmarked for cloud computing in 2013, up from 14% in 2010.

                               A look at the technology 

                               We believe the technology is different than todays software stack as the code base needs to 
                               be developed and optimized for the Web, in a mu lti-tenant architecture. As such, successful 
                               applications are embedding more  advanced Web 2.0 capabilities  and scripting (AJAX, mash-
                               ups, etc.) to deliver robust functionally within the browser. Furthermore, we believe the most 
                               successful vendors longer-term will enable meta data customization that offer customers the 
                               ability to customize the presentation layer need s (as well as workflow and some other areas) 
                               to be able to offer feature/functionality, customization, and scalability together.

                                    Software-as-a-service enables economies of sc            ale through a multi-tenant architecture 
                                    approach (multiple tenants/customers are supported  on a single instance of an application) 
                                    that scales at lower infrastructure costs. This   is possible through the pooling of resources 
                                    (such as network connections and partitioning of large databases ensure efficient utilization 
                                    of resources) while still being able to diffe     rentiate data belonging to different customers 
                                    using metadata to configure the way an appl ication appears and behaves for its users. The 
                                    provision of shared services (billing,          metering maintenance of hardware & other 
                                    infrastructure) across all customers contributes to a reduction in fixed cost per customer.

              Virtualization doesnt limit application instances or database instances     Virtualization is driving IT costs down 
              by enhancing server utilization, enabling better systems management, and lowering admin costs by virtualizing the

              applications to internet-type performance is unproven in core business areas

                                    There are three popular implementation models in  the industry, of which we believe only the 
                                    multi-tenant model truly delivers a generationally more efficient delivery of software. 

                                        Hosted on-premise:  A commonly cited on-demand appr  oach from legacy on-premise 
                                        vendors is a delivery model that resembles that of a Managed Service Provider, whereby 
                                        customers have web-access to an on-premise              offering such that they maintain the 
                                        benefits of on-premise software (via customization) but outsource the data center costs. 
                                        A hosted on-premise offering (like Oracles legacy on-demand business or Microsofts 
                                        recent push on the Dynamics portfolio) does   not lead to significant infrastructure cost 
                                        savings.  

                                        Isolated Tenancy:  utilizes one application version with configuration capabilities 
                                        alongside a separate data model for each cu  stomer, thus enabling  modification to the 
                                        data structure and ease of transitioning to an on-premise version (SAPs traditional 
                                        model).

                                    Telenavs solution architecture  is multi-tenant, allowing large deployments (now over 14m 
                                    subscribers) hosted on a common infrastructure that enjoys the scale benefits of SaaS. 

                                    Although the overall themes from our previous           reports on SaaS in 2006 [Software-as-a-
                                    Service: Opening Eyes in '07; Half the Market  in '13] and 2008 [SaaS and Cloud Computing: 
                                    End game clearer in '08 - Legacy checkmate]  continue and many are strengthening, several 
                                    new dynamics have emerged: 

                                    1.   Platforms are forming as cloud computing moves front and center - There is a more 
                                         pronounced push towards platforms-as-a-s          ervice. Cloud computing platforms have 
                                         emerged that enable corporate IT, ISVs, SI  s, and independent developers to build and 
                                         deliver SaaS applications over the Internet (without the heavy investments in 
                                         infrastructure). CRMs Force.com, Googles  App Engine, Amazons EC2 web services 
                                         are all gaining traction, helped by slow capital spending during the recent recession. 

                                    2.   Software and Internet heavyweights are star         ting to respond - Google, Yahoo!, SAP, 
                                         Microsoft, Oracle. However, the heavyweights  entry into SaaS has been tentative at 
                                         best. We see various struggles (similar to the reason for SAPs delay in 
                                         BusinessByDesign). Structural misalignment,  time-to-market with R&D impediments, 
                                         cannibalization threats, and  business model hurdles may all be potentially too high to 
                                         overcome 

                                    3.   Ecosystems appear to be changing - The larg er SI providers appear to be only dabbling 
                                         and seem reticent to significantly push SaaS, as the services attached are still relatively 
                                         small. However, all major SIs have initiatives to engage with many SaaS vendors and 
                                         many have built practices around extending  their historical on-premise competencies to 
                                         hybrid models that include certain cloud-based applications.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                               

                               SaaS is distinct trend from other technological shifts 

                               We see SaaS and the shift to cloud computing as more than just a technology and a business 
                               model adjustment for the industry as it points to a migration to outsource much of corporate 
                               ITs administrative processes (i.e., storage, security, application management, database 
                               management, etc.) while accelerating the pace  of innovation and likely improving economic 
                               productivity more generally. This differs dramat ically from other trends pushed down from 
                               the CIO such as SOA (Services Oriented Ar       chitecture), Virtualization, use of software 
                               appliances, etc. New platforms and services   are being developed for enterprises moving 
                               beyond four-walled systems. Such a transfor  mation is likely to have a more pronounced 
                               impact on a corporations productivity than a shift in architectures within an IT department 

                               Marketing messages often cloud the value differences between 
                               SaaS and Virtualization 

                               While there has been increased rhetoric aroun   d different marketing messages and even 
                               some confusion as to virtualization technologi es being a substitute to SaaS, we stress that 
                               the use of virtualization technology to lower IT support costs for client/server software is a far 
                               cry and distinct from SaaS. We believe the value from SaaS is derived from multi-tenancy and 
                               provider control of one-version of software as th is drives faster innovation (i.e., focused R&D 
                               on one version), better scaling, and lower management and infrastructure costs. 

                               Multi-tenancy is most likely to perform at intern et scale only if customization/configuration is 
                               done at the metadata layer. This requires a   different approach to application development 
                               than the traditional client/server model, and take s time to tune and optimize and build mature 
                               functionality. Salesforce.com has been buildi  ng this for almost ten years and has only 
                               recently enabled complex workflow and business   logic rules. We believe competitors will 
                               have difficulty replicating this and anticipate  many iterations of development before they can 
                               match performance

                                  Service Delivery Platform:  TeleNav operates on a modular and scalable hosted service 
                                  delivery platform (SDP). This allows TeleNav   to respond to voice and data requests from 
                                  clients by bringing multiple types of in       formation together. Communication between 
                                  TeleNavs SDP and client softwa re installed on mobile phones or other GPS devices occurs 
                                  on wireless carrier partners networks. TeleNav s SDP can be scaled up by adding individual 
                                  service elements, such as application servers       or database nodes. The ease of capacity 
                                  addition enables TeleNav to serve a growing end user base without disruption in service. 

                                  TeleNavs SDP is closely integrated with it       s wireless carrier partners network. This 
                                  integration with networks allows TeleNav to ac  hieve efficient server load balancing and to 
                                  minimize downtime. Usin g proprietary applications, TeleNa v has successfully integrated its

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                       

                                 SDP with various third-party content providers.       This integration helps in the delivery of 
                                 enhanced location based services. 

                                 Client software: TeleNavs client application is designed to support over 500 mobile phone 
                                 models, operating on all major mo bile operating systems. The client software is adaptable to 
                                 evolving feature sets in new phones to create an improved user experience. It also works 
                                 together with the service delivery platform to  extract the latest inform ation, data, and other 
                                 services without the need to use phone memory  for data-intensive services like map and POI 
                                 storage. Requests made by end users are ca          ptured by the SDP interface using client 
                                 software. 

                                 Client software can be adapted to offer a      customized user interface to support preferred 
                                 features and functions. TeleNav can wirelessly   provide automatic updates of its service to 
                                 mobile phones without the need to upload new  client software. The client application caches 
                                 the route and navigation information at the beginning as well as during the trip, so that in the 
                                 event of a loss of or decline in connectivity du ring the trip, simplified  navigation services can 
                                 be provided. 

                                 Customers: 

                                 TeleNav primarily distributes and offers its      LBS to end users through wireless carrier 
                                 partners. These partners provide LBS to their subscribers either as a stand-alone service or as 
                                 a bundle plan combining various voice and data  services. TeleNav charges its wireless carrier 
                                 partners a monthly subscription fee for each         end user that subscribes to LBS. This 
                                 subscription fee is either fixed or derived on  a revenue sharing basis. TeleNav customers are 
                                 primarily concentrated in the United States      (97% revenue in 9M/10 ), with the remaining 
                                 revenues coming from Asia and Europe.  

                                 TeleNav derives a substantial portion of its re venue from two wireless carrier partners, Sprint 
                                 (55% of revenues in 9M/10) and AT&T (34% of revenues in 9M/10).

                                   Business Overview: 

                                   Revenue Stream 
                                   TeleNav has partnered with various wireless ca  rriers to reach out to its end users. These 
                                   partners offer TeleNavs LBS to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle 
                                   with data or voice services. For customer su        bscription to LBS and activation for certain 
                                   services, the partners pay TeleNav a monthly f ee on a per-end-user basis. The subscription 
                                   fee is either fixed or derived on a revenue sharing arrangement wherein a minimum fee per 
                                   end user is defined. The monthly fee per end user is lower when the end user subscribes to 
                                   a bundle plan compared to a standalone            subscription. The revenue generated for any 
                                   subscriber varies and changes over time.

                                 Revenue has grown 82% from $8 million in 3Q09  to $15 million in 3Q10, primarily due to an 
                                 increase in end users of TeleNavs services. This is driven by an increase in subscribers to 
                                 Sprints Simply Everything plans as well as grow th in subscribers for AT&T Navigator.  The 
                                 average monthly subscribers have grown from  1.0 million in March  2008 to $14.5 million in 
                                 March 2010.  

                                 Since demand for mobile phones is higher du        ring the holiday season in November and 
                                 December, activations in these months al         so increase. Therefore, the business has 
                                 experienced seasonality during the past.  

                                 However, TeleNav has witnessed an 18% fall in  ARPU from $1.24 in 3Q09 to $1.02 in 3Q10, 
                                 mainly due to: 

                                     An increase in end users accessing TeleNav        services through white label offerings 
                                     launched by the wireless carrier partners     . The monthly fee per end user on these 
                                     offerings is lower compared to the branded offerings. 

                                     Bundle offer plans also fetch a lower per end user fee. 

                                 Nevertheless, the impact of decline in ARPU   was offset by the increase in the number of 
                                 average monthly paying end users.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                      

                                 Financial Overview: 

                                 Revenue Forecast 
                                 TeleNavs revenue increased 131% from 48 milli  on in FY08 to 111 million  in FY09. This is 
                                 primarily due to the introduction of bundling pl ans by Sprint and the resulting increase in its 
                                 subscriber base. This increase in end users ha     s more than offset the decrease in ARPU 
                                 witnessed during this period.  Since navigation  is increasingly becoming an important feature 
                                 of smartphones, we expect the number of LBS end users for LBS to continuously increase. 
                                 We have, therefore, modeled TeleNav revenues  to grow at a CAGR of 57% over six years 
                                 ($28 million in FY07 to  $265 million in FY12E). We expect Te leNavs subscribers to increase 
                                 from 3.1m in FY08 to 23m by FY12, with ARPU declining from $1.87 to $0.98.

                                 TeleNavs gross margins have hovered in the rang e of 78% to 84% in the past nine quarters. 
                                 For 3QFY10, the company reported gross margins of 84%, up from 83% in 2QFY10. 
                                 TeleNavs gross margins are affected by declines in ARPU and changes in usage rates. The 
                                 company expects its gross margins to decline as ARPU declines and the cost of revenue 
                                 increases in both absolute terms and as a   percentage of revenue. Accordingly, we model 
                                 gross margins to decline from 82% in FY10 to 78% in FY11 and 75% in FY12.    

                                 On the operating margin front, TeleNavs marg       ins have risen substantially, from -9% in 
                                 1QFY08 to 42% in 3QFY10. The  company expects operating expenses to increase as builds 
                                 its infrastructure, add employees, and incur and  other administrative costs. Accordingly, we 
                                 model operating margins to decline from 40% in FY10 to 31% in FY11 and 29% in FY12.

                                  TeleNavs cash conversion cycle has fluctuated  over the years, increasing from 12 days in 
                                  FY07 to 71 days in FY08 and then declining to         40 days in FY09. This   was largely due to 
                                  fluctuations in the receivables turnover, which  increased from 48 days in FY07 to 109 days in 
                                  FY08 and then declined to 78 days in FY09.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                 

                                Valuation 

                                Initiate with a $12 price target 
                                Our valuation is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a 12.5% discount rate and a 
                                3% growth rate. We obtained this rate us       ing a weighted average cost of capital in 
                                conjunction with the capital asset pricing model,  adjusted for Cisco's capital structure. Our 
                                growth rate is determined by comparison with  other companies in the industry, the overall 
                                industry growth rate, and overall economic gr  owth. Our discount rate is derived from the 
                                CAP Model using a weighted average cost of capi tal. The discount rate is premised on a risk 
                                free rate of 5.5%, a country premium of 5% and a beta of 1.4. The growth rate is based on 
                                our estimate of long-term economic growth. 

                                We think of TeleNav as a SaaS company that ha ppens to offer navigation services. As such, 
                                we believe the valuation should be bounded at the high end by SaaS leaders such as 
                                Salesforce.com and Concur, and at the low      end by navigation hardware companies like 
                                Garmin and TomTom. PNDs are flat-to-declin ing hardware businesses and not good comps 
                                for the SaaS-based TeleNav.  

                                TeleNavs high growth, solid margins a sticky   and scale-driven business should deserve a 
                                premium. However, TNAV is in a business mode l transition for which we apply a discount. 
                                Near-term, recurring subscriber fees (e.g., AT &T Navigator for $10 per mo nth) are moving to 
                                bundled services (ala Sprint),  which have driven most of the recent growth, but also pushed 
                                down ARPU. Mid-to-longer-term, free offerings  from Google, Nokia, Microsoft and others 
                                could further transition the business to   free-to-subscriber, paid for by new revenue 
                                streams such as advertising and m-commerce.  Th e first transition is already in progress, but 
                                its too early to accurately model the second transition.   

                                Our $12 price target embeds a CY11 P/E of 11x, in line with the PND vendors but at a 
                                discount to a broader universe of consumer electronics stocks. TeleNav is currently trading at 
                                an CY11 P/E of 8x, a discount to PND vendors 9x and the broader universe of 14x.   

                                We value our SaaS coverage on a cash flow basis using an EV/uFCF multiple, since we 
                                believe unlevered free cash flows are the best reflection of a subscription based business 
                                model. TNAV is currently trading at 6.4x on CY11 estimates vs. our SaaS coverage of a dozen 
                                companies at 25x.  The $12 PT would imply an       EV/FCF multiple of 14.3x, still at a steep 
                                discount to the peer group. 

                                Risks 

                                Customer concentration 
                                TeleNav primarily distributes and offers its   LBS to end users through wireless carrier 
                                partners. These partners provide LBS to their subscribers either as a stand-alone service or as 
                                part of a bundle plan. TeleNav derives approximately 90% of its revenue from two wireless 
                                carrier partners, Sprint (55% of revenues in 9M /10) and AT&T (34% of revenues in 9M/10). A 
                                high concentration of customers and absence      of long term exclusivity contract are risk 
                                factors for TeleNav. 

                                Intense competition 
                                TeleNav operates in an intensely competitive in dustry and faces stiff competition from larger 
                                companies with higher customer bases and sound er financial, technical, marketing and sales 
                                & distribution resources.  Developments like G oogles decision to offer free, voice-guided, 
                                turn by turn navigation to An droid based mobile devices and Nokias offering of maps on its 
                                smartphones to facilitate free  turn by turn navigati on could have negative implications for 
                                TeleNavs business operations.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                  

                                The free offering of LBS to subscribers may also  adversely affect TeleNavs relationship with 
                                wireless carrier partners. They may decide to t erminate relation with TeleNav, not market its 
                                services aggressively, or reduce subscripti on fees. Any such developments could hamper 
                                profitability, increase sales and marketing expense, and damage market share. 

                                Dependence on carrier partners for growth 
                                TeleNav is dependent on its carrier partners for marketing and distribution of its LBS. TeleNav 
                                relies on its wireless carrier partners to prom ote GPS enabled mobile phones that are pre-
                                loaded with TeleNavs client software.  

                                Shift in pricing plans 
                                TeleNav offers LBS to customers through direct  subscription or bundled plans offered by its 
                                carrier partners. Though direct customer subscrip tions result in higher ARPU, there has been 
                                a significant shift in TeleNavs customer base using its LBS through bundled service plans 
                                from wireless carriers. Growth of bundle service subscribers in the customer mix has lead to 
                                decline in ARPU from $5.49 in 2Q08 to $1.      02 in 3Q10. Though bundled services gives 
                                TeleNav the scale, they lead to decline in AR  PU, which, if not offset through new revenue 
                                streams and economies of scale, could lead to a decline in margins.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG , a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the  Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.
