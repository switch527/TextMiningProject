                                                      We   think   that   Teavana   Holdings,   Inc.’s   (TEA-NYSE)   differentiated   store
          Price                             $20.89
                                                      experience and unique in-store labor model make it one of the most attractive

                                                      think significant growth exists after the first 500 stores. The stock remains one of the

                 EPS (Net) Summary
                                                      KEY INVESTMENT POINTS
           FY Jan      2011A     2012E     2013E      The Teaopia acquisition can drive meaningful long-term earnings growth. As
                                                      noted previously, we think Teavana's acquisition of Canadian retailer Teaopia should
           1Q           $0.09     $0.10        --
                                                      drive about $0.16 in earnings (see Exhibit 2) once fully converted to the Teavana store
           2Q           $0.03     $0.04        --
                                                      model, product and selling culture. TEA acquired this 46-store retail chain for $26.9
           3Q           $0.02     $0.03        --     million in an all cash transaction. The transaction will be neutral to earnings in FY12
           4Q           $0.32     $0.42        --     and $0.03-$0.04 accretive in FY13. Over time, TEA's management expects to raise
           YEAR         $0.46     $0.59     $0.81     Teaopia's sales productivity levels (currently at less than half of Teavana's) to Teavana's
           First Call     --     $0.60E    $0.80E     levels. Management seems happy with the acquired asset base and believes that it can
           P/E          45.4x     35.4x     25.8x     quickly implement the Teavana labor model and product offering.

                                                      CPG opportunity. In contrast to the average tea offering in grocery stores today (which
                                                      are stored in a warehouse for a few years before getting packaged and distributed),
                                                      Teavana's teas typically turn every month. While management would not commit to a
                                                      timeline on a CPG offering, it is clear that all options remain on the table. Specifically,
                                                      management seemed open to a grocery store offering, single serve offering, and
                                                      bottled drinks.

                                                      Innovation. Teavana continues to rollout new product introductions, with a new iced
                                                      tea campaign launching this summer and 15 new tea flavors this fall. Importantly, the
                                                      Company also continues to innovate in the tea merchandise category, particularly as
                                                      it endeavors to make brewing tea more convenient. Finally, look for the Company to
                                                      focus on a CRM system after it hires a new VP of Marketing.

VALUATION
At 35.4x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.1x 2012 PEG, we believe valuation is attractive for a high-growth retailer. We
think the Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong
new store economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average
of 32.1x 2012 P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 16.3x 2012 EV/EBITDA
compared to 13.4x EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We reiterate our $28 price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59
2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk. Risks include, but are not
limited to: deterioration in the consumer spending environment, slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk
associated with being in a seasonal, cyclical, and trend focused sector.

Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our price target include but are not limited to the following:
ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, retention of senior management.
