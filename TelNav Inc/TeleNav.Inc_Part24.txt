                                    •   Paying subs increased to 17,700 from 16,100 last quarter, representing 64% y/y and 
                                         10% q/q growth. This shows solid growth amid an environment of free turn-by-turn 
                                         competitor offerings. 

                                    •   ARPU of $0.94 vs. $1.10 last year and $1.03 last quarter. The decline was expected 
                                         due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings and, to a lesser extent, the 
                                         Sprint re-negotiation (the resolution came with roughly 9 days left in the September 
                                         quarter). 

                                    •   As a reminder, the term of the Sprint agreement was extended for one year with 
                                         TNAV’s preferred provider status now expiring two years later than originally 
                                         scheduled. TeleNav will receive a guaranteed annual fixed fee from Sprint for 
                                         navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles which will change from 
                                         year to year over the contract period. TeleNav will recognize revenue from the fees 
                                         monthly on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 

                                    •   The AT&T contract, which is a three-year agreement that automatically renews on an 
                                         annual basis, comes up for renewal in March 2011. Unlike the Sprint contract, this one 
                                         is a revenue share agreement (MRC). Management commentary is that it fully expects 
                                         the contract to renew. 

                                    •   TNAV saw revenue growth at all key carriers in the quarter. 

                                    •   Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter was $131M, up from $113M in FQ4/10. 
                                         Net cash per share increased to $2.92 from $2.69 last quarter.  

                                    •   FQ2/11 revenue/EPS guidance of $45M-$47M/$0.14-$0.16 vs. consensus of 
                                         $43M/$0.13.

ESTIMATES 

Our FQ2/11 estimate ticks up nicely on the heels of the strong FQ1/11 report. Our revenue 
estimate goes to $46M from $44M, sitting at the midpoint of guidance, while our EPS 
estimate of $0.16 (up from $0.11) is at the high-end of the guidance range. 

Our F2011 estimates were increased, as well, with our new revenue/EPS estimates of 
$190M/$0.67 falling in the middle of the guidance range.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our $10 target price implies a 5x multiple on our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $61M and 
takes into account prepayment amounts received in October. We believe that core 
operating fundamentals are strong and continue to believe that opportunities from mobile 
advertising and commerce exist going forward. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
