                                       In 4Q11, we are looking for EPS of $0.26 and EBITDA of $9.8 million. The consensus 
                                       estimate is $0.25.     Our estimate assumes total sales increase 18.0% to $117.1 million  driven 
                                       by 9% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 50 bp to 26.5%. We forecast 
                                       operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 27.8% to $21.2 million, no change from last years 
                                       margin of 18.1%  leading to a 78-bp improvement in operating margins to 7.9%, or $9.2 
                                       million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.8 million, a 50-bp expansion in margin to 8.4%. We 
                                       assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate and 21.1 million shares outstanding, 
                                       which gets us to EPS of $0.26.  

                                       In 2012, our EPS estimate remains at $0.99.                  Consensus EPS is $0.97. Our EBITDA 
                                       estimate is $38.0 million.       Our estimate assumes total sales increase 12.5% to $442.5 million 
                                       (vs. consensus of $435.0 million), with gross margins improving 30 bp to 26.6%. We forecast 
                                       operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 5.1%                  to $79.6 million, a 90-bp year-over-year 
                                       improvement in margin  leading to a 116-bp improvement in operating margins to 8.0%, or 
                                       $35.5 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $38.0 million, a 120-bp improvement in margin to 
                                       8.6%. We assume interest expense of $1.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate and 21.0 million shares 
                                       outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.99.  

                                       In 3Q11, CHEF reported a LPS of $0.06, or               an EPS of $0.19 when adjusting for several 
                                       one-time items. Adjusted EPS was in line with both our estimate and consensus of $0.19. 
                                       Total sales increased 19.7% to $101.7 million  versus our estimate for 13.5% growth. Gross 
                                       margins improved 21 bp to 26.2%, which was better than our estimate for 75-bp deterioration. 
                                       Operating expenses (excluding D&A) grew 24. 3% to $19.1 million when we exclude a one-
                                       time stock compensation expense and add expected incremental public company costs. We 
                                       were looking for growth in operating expenses (excluding D&A) of 9.1%. Operating margins 
                                       deteriorated 42 bp to 6.9%, or $7.1 million, while EBITDA margins deteriorated 47 bp to 7.4%, 
                                       or $7.5 million. We were looking for operating margin deterioration of 20 bp and EBITDA

                                  margin deterioration of 5 bp. Interest expense came in at $0.5 million after adjusting for the 
                                  post IPO capital structure and one time charges re lated to debt repayments in connection with 
                                  the IPO. Using a normalized 39% tax rate and pro forma 20.8 million shares outstanding gets us 
                                  to EPS of $0.19.  

                                  Additional Takeaways  

                                     The company has seen no change in customer behavior; 

                                     Both case volumes and revenues per case increased in 3Q; 

                                     The companys unique customer growth was in line with trends seen in 1H11; 

                                     The company temporarily increased transportati on infrastructure (fleet capacity increased 
                                      30% in 3Q) and labor infrastructure in order to maintain high service levels with the 
                                      recently acquired Harry Wils customer base       this was a conscious decision made to 
                                      minimize rates of (unwanted) attrition  and maximize retention; 

                                     The decision to increase fleet capacity was larg ely a function of adjusting to new delivery 
                                      windows for the acquired customer base. With  time, the company will optimize routes and 
                                      change delivery windows to minimize incremental expense; 

                                     With the Harry Wils acquisition  one of CH  EFs largest competitors, the split between 
                                      organic growth and acquisitions will shift sli ghtly to higher acquisition growth. This is not 
                                      an indication that organic growth is slowing  it is merely a function of the fact that CHEF 
                                      acquired a competitor that it had previously been gaining share from;  

                                     Mix remained unchanged sequentially, while inflation abated slightly  largely a function 
                                      of lower rates of inflation in dairy; and 

                                     The improved gross margin was a function of   a mix shift within the protein category to 
                                      higher margin items.

Methodology: Our target price values CHEF at an  FY12 EV/EBITDA of 9.4x and P/E of 16.2x. 
Risks: Key risks to our CHEF price target include increased compe  tition from traditional broadline op erators or consolidation among  other regional 
specialty distributors, deterioration in the national or New York economy as it relates to disc  retionary spending at restaurant s, the success and 
completion of future acquisitions at fair  prices, significant increases in raw material costs, and tainted product or product recall which could tarnish the 
company's image.
