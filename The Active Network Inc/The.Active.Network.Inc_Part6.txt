Strong Technology Revenue Growth 
Contributes to Beat Quarter  

Active Network reported Q4 results at the higher end of guidance for Revenue 
and Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact from StarCite acquisition). Total 
revenue grew 23% Y/Y to $76.0MM vs. our $74.9MM and consensus 
$74.4MM. This was the companys third straight quarter with revenue growth 
above 20%. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of StarCite acquisition, 
came at $2.3MM ($400K including about $1.9MM in severance costs related to 
the StarCite acquisition) vs. our $2.4MM and consensus $2.4MM. GAAP net 
loss per share was ($0.16), above our ($0.23) and consensus ($0.22). 
Technology revenue was up 33% Y/Y to $65.5MM and Marketing Services 
revenue was down 15% Y/Y to $10.6MM 

Registrations in Q4 increased 13% Y/Y to 17.3MM bringing Net Registration 
revenue to $46.4MM. Average revenue per registration increased 4.6% Y/Y to 
$2.68. For 2011, registrations grew 14% Y/Y to 80.3MM with revenue per 
registration at $2.85. Some 51,300 organizations utilized Actives technology 
solutions, up 8% Y/Y. 

 

Guidance 

For 1Q12, Active Network guided for total revenue between $89MM and 
$93MM ($91MM at midpoint), above consensus $87.9MM. Adjusted EBITDA 
(including a $5MM impact from StarCite acquisition) is expected to be between 
negative $5MM and negative $3MM (negative $4MM at midpoint), below 
consensus $5.2MM. For FY12, Active expects total revenue between $425MM 
and $435MM ($430MM at midpoint), above consensus $409MM. Adjusted 
EBITDA is expected to be between $46MM and $50MM ($48MM at midpoint), 
below consensus $51MM. 

Although management explained on the call how purchase accounting affects 
their 2012 guidance, we believe it would be helpful to highlight here that the 
above guidance excludes about $14MM in deferred revenue (most of which 
flows right through to the bottom line) from Actives recent acquisitions (mostly 
StarCite). If the company were not subject to these accounting rules, revenue 
guidance for FY12 would have been close to $439MM-$449MM ($444MM at 
midpoint, up 32% Y/Y). Similarly, Adjusted EBITDA would have been about 
$60MM for a margin of about 13.5% (more than 200bps improvement Y/Y).

Management Continues Executing on Strategy 
Active Network remains our small-cap top pick as we still believe the company 
is just beginning to realize the benefits of leverage built into its model. As our 
guidance clarification above has shown, if the company was not subject to 
purchase accounting rules on its recent acquisitions, 2012 guidance would have 
shown a very nice margin improvement over 2011. Management remains 
focused on execution and balancing strategic acquisitions with platform and 
product enhancements that attract and retain customers. As management shared 
on the call, back-end functionality (business automation) is the most sticky part 
of Actives offerings and where it invests about 90% of efforts and dollars. 
Other areas of focus include integration of products where strong synergies exist 
(StarCite), new product development (for outdoors, swimming, endurance), and 
mobile / social. In Q4 Active launched its mobile platform which allows 
customers to offer customized, branded iPhone and Android apps to consumers. 
With 19% of Active.com traffic in the quarter coming from mobile devices, the 
company plans to expand efforts in mobile.  

We believe the company is in the early stages of a material, long-term 
opportunity. By phasing off duplicate R&D spend for legacy systems and by 
migrating off-line registrations to online, Active is just beginning to realize the 
benefits of leverage built into its model. Currently, the North American market 
is penetrated approximately 6% and presents a significant growth opportunity. 
Similarly, international revenue is just about 3% of total revenue for Active 
Network and the company is in the early stages of building international 
presence  just opened its fourth international office in Sydney, Australia in Q4.

   Statement of Risk 

Risks include 1) integration of recent acquisitions and impact on margins, 2)

concerns include the failure to compete successfully against current or future 
competitors, failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, and 
inability to expand business outside North America. The company's failure to 
expand customers' use of its applications and to increase the percentage of 
participants who register through its website are two additional risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.
