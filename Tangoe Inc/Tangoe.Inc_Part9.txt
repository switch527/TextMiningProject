Chasing the Wolfbone Play in Delaware Basin, Texas

The Permian Basin is going through a drilling renaissance. We watched the Midland Basin Wolfcamp Shale play unfold in the last 18
months and we are turning our attention to the Delaware Basin, to an equally high potential trend: the Wolfbone Play in eastern Reeves
County. This play is tightly held and the first movers are: J. Cleo Thompson (private), Clayton Williams Energy Inc. (CWEI-$79.26,
Buy), Comstock Resources (CRK-NR), Eagle Oil and Gas (private), Atlantic Operating Company (private), Patriot Resources (private)
and Concho Resources (CXO-$102.81, Buy). In addition to Reeves County, Pecos County could have Wolfbone potential. Moving toward
the north central parts of Reeves County and spilling into Ward County, producers such as Energen Corp. (EGN-NR) are pursuing a
highly prospective and overpressured 3rd Bone Spring Sand. There are many ways to slice and dice the Delaware Basin and we expect
to have a more granular view of the various plays as 2012 unfolds.

Initiating Coverage With a Buy; Best Telecom Expense Management Dance Partner

We are initiating coverage of Tangoe, Inc. (TNGO) with a Buy rating and $30.00 target price. Having consolidated a significant number
of  competitors  and  expanded  its  suite  of  offerings  via  both  internal  development  and  strategic  acquisitions  in  fixed  and  wireless
Telecommunications  Expense  Management  (TEM)  and  in  Mobile  Device  Management  (MDM),  Tangoe  has  become  a  one  stop
Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM) provider. In our view, as a sector dominator, the companys accelerated revenue and
earnings growth, combined with its recurring and predictable financial model, create a compelling investment that should outperform the
broader market.
