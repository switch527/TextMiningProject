 Overview: 
 TeleNav is the leading provider of locati on based services (LBS) for mobile devices,  including the carrier-branded navigation applications offered 
 by Sprint and AT&T.  Its scalable, web-based platform integrates        third party map, point of interest and traffic data, deliverin g voice guided 
 directions on more than 500 types of mobile phones.  The company          has grown revenues rapidly by ta pping into its carriers vast  distribution 
 networks, and hopes to leverage its 14.5 million installed user base to gain a foothold in the nascent-but-promising mobile advertising market. 
  
 Rating Rationale: 
 TeleNavs hosted service model drives recurri ng, subscription-based revenues and strong  cash flows.  The company has rapidly an d profitably 
 grown sales of its core navigation product by leveraging the ma rketing and distribution infrastructure of key carrier partners,  though maintaining 
 exclusivity is a key concern given the high levels of revenue co ncentration.  Overall, its large installed user base provides a  first mover advantage, 
 but pressure from OEMs and OS providers with free navigation applications could intensify anticipated margin pressures.  
  
 Business: 
 Provides voice guided navigation services  for GPS-enabled mobile phones (94%), includ ing the turn-by-turn navigation applicatio ns offered by 
 leading US wireless carriers Sprint (55% of revenues) and AT&T (34% ).  In total, has 14.5 million end users and partners with 1 5 wireless carriers 
 in 29 countries. US is 97% of sales.  In tegrates third party content to provide 3D moving maps, points of interest (POIs), traf fic alerts, gas prices 
 and weather updates.  TeleNavs web-based delivery platform su pports more than 500 types of handsets and all major operating sy stems.  Client 
 software is typically pre-installed on mobile phones, allowing us    ers to access updated information and routing services without       using device 
 memory for map and POI storage.  End users are generally bille  d on a monthly basis through their wireless carrier, which offer   services on a 
 bundled (Sprint) or stand-alone basis ($10/month for AT&T).  Carri ers pay TeleNav monthly fees on a per-subscriber or revenue s haring basis.  
 Other 6% of revenue is generated from mobile phone-based workfo  rce management/tracking systems  (Xerox) and in-dash navigation s ystems 
 (Ford).  Also targets mobile/location based advertising.  Relie  s on the marketing and distribution channels of its wireless net  work partners to 
 drive adoption; also sells directly to end users through its website and mobile phone application stores (iTunes App Store).  R&D team consists of 
 670 employees, primarily located in China.  Leases data center space in Sunnyvale, Sacramento and Santa Clara.

 Latest Results and Outlook 
 
 Recent Financial Trends: 
 For the nine months ended March 2010, revenue increased 59% as a result of a 102% increase in average monthly paying end users, primarily due 
 to adoption of Sprint's bundled "Simply Ev erything" plans, which provide navigation se rvices at no additional charge.  The stro ng user growth 
 was partly offset by a 21% decline in monthly ARPU driven by an   increasing mix of carrier-branded and bundled channels, in addi tion to a fee 
 reduction from key partner Sprint; in July   2009, TeleNav agreed to lower Sprints per-us  er fees in exchange for an extension of   its exclusive 
 agreement through calendar 2010.  Gross profit grew 60% as the re sult of lower content and customer support costs, which were p artially offset 
 by the decrease in ARPU and rising per-subscriber usage rates.   Operating profit grew 77% due to strong leverage on sales and m arketing costs, 
 though adjusted net income grew more slowly  at 64% as the result of a tax benefit in th e prior stub period.  Cash flow from ope rations declined 
 by 9% due to a $14 million increase in receivables.

 Management has built an impressive track r ecord of rapid-yet-profitable growth and m aintains a respectable 12% ownership stake  following the 
 IPO.  The CFO has public company experien ce and executive compensation is very reasona ble.  That said, only one of six board me  mbers is 
 independent by our standards, and there was modest insider se lling on the deal ($12 million).  Nonetheless, managements solid  execution keeps 
 our governance rating at strong.

                                                     About Renaissance Capital 
                                                                   
Renaissance Capital LLC (Renaissance Capital or RC), founde d in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991, is the global leader in 
IPO research.  Its clients represent the Whos Who list of t he largest and most active institutional IPO investors.  As an 
independent research provider, Renaissance Capital does not rece  ive payment for research or investment banking services 
from companies under coverage.   
 
In addition to IPO research, Renaissance Capital maintain     s the FTSE Renaissance IPO Composite Index, the definitive 
benchmark of IPO performance and activity, and it manages the IPO Plus Fund, the first mutual fund to focus solely on investing 
in IPOs.  The Fund has a 10 year track record.  FTSE is jointly owned by the Financial Times of London and the London Stock 
Exchange. 
 
Renaissance Capital was established by three Wharton MBA gra duates after they spent over a decade on Wall Street (Merrill 
Lynch, Citi, Bear Stearns, Kidder Peabody   and Credit Suisse First Boston) where they   worked in the areas of investment 
banking, helping young companies raise capital via initial public  offerings, as well as portfolio management, equity research and 
corporate financial restructuring.   
 
Institutional clients have valued Renaissance Capitals IPO research for nearly two decades because of its timely, market savvy 
insights on every US initial public offering and a growing roster  of non-US IPOs.  Renaissance  Capital augments its seasoned 
judgment with a proprietary, expert system for evaluating newly public companies. 
     
                                                                   
                                                       Important Disclosures 
                                                                   
                                                                   
Renaissance Capital Rating Distribution 
 
Renaissance Capitals composite investment ratings fall into three categories:  Outperform (15 to 20), Marketperform (10 to 
14) and Underperform (4 to 9).  These categories are defined as follows: Abov e Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform better than the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months.  Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over   the next 3 months.  Below Average: the subject company is 
expected to perform below the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months. 
 
For purposes of FINRA/N YSE disclosure rules, RCs  Outperform rating most closely corresponds to a buy recommendation; 
RCs Marketperform rating most closely corresponds to a hold/neutral rating; and RCs     Underperform rating most closely 
corresponds to a sell rating.  However Above Average, Average  and Below Average are not the same as buy, hold/neutral and 
sell ratings, as RCs stock ratings are determined on a relative  basis.  An investors decision to buy or sell a stock should 
depend on individual circumstances and risk tolerance.  For the y ear 2009, the distribution of RCs research opinions were as 
follows:  
 
 
                                                                   
                                 Outperform 20% 
                                 Marketperform 74.9% 
                                 Underperform 5.1% 
                                                                   
                                                                   
RC does not have an investment banking operation, and does not have investment banking relationships with any of the companies it 
researches, therefore no distribution of research ratings by investment banking clients are shown above.

Historical Recommendations and Price  
 
The following table details the history of all RC research recommendations on TNAV since its initial public offering.   
 
                                                                   
                                                                  
Firm Certifications  
 
RCs research team is responsible for the rating and recommendat ion expressed herein.  Each member of the research team 
responsible for this report has certified  to RC that the views expressed herein accu rately reflect his or her personal views ab out 
the subject securities and issuer.  Accordingly, RC certif  ies that the recommendation, rating and views expressed herein 
represent the personal views of each member of the research team.  Further, no member of the research team was, is or will be 
paid compensation directly related to the specific recommendation, rating or views expressed herein.   
 
RC is a registered investment   adviser providing portfolio management services  to a diversified mutual fund, the IPO Plus 
Aftermarket Fund (the Fund), which is r egistered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
The Fund may take positions that are contrary to recommendati  ons expressed in a public research report published by RC.  
Also, the Fund may invest to a limited extent in the securities  of public companies that are the subject of a research report 
published by RC.  As a diversified mutual fund, the Fund is limite d to investing no greater than 5% of Fund assets in the share s 
of any one issuer.  As of the date of this report, the Fund does   not beneficially own 1% or more of  the securities of the issue r 
subject to this report.   
 
Members of the research team are compensat ed primarily from firm revenue on the basis of several factors, including quality of 
research, client feedback, stock picking, comp etitive factors and overall revenues of RC  consisting of fees from research and 
money management.  Members of the research team may also rece ive, as one aspect of overall compensation, benefits from a 
compensation program based upon an increase in the net asset value of the Fund. Although members of RCs research team 
(and their households) are prohibited from making direct inve    stments in the securities about   which they report, research 
personnel are permitted to invest in the Fund.  While the Fund       is limited in the amount it can invest in a single stock, 
compensation tied to the Fund or the performance of an investment  in the Fund, could indirectly influence a recommendation or 
rating on such a stock expressed in the report.   
 
In as much as neither RC nor any affiliate has investment banking functions, no research personnel are compensated directly 
or indirectly from investment banking revenue.
