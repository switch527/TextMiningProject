      Strong 4Q10 results; increased confidence for on-time launch of Model S                          28
      Tesla reported 4Q10 EPS of -$0.47 vs DB es timate of -$0.54. Overall, we continue                24
      to be impressed with Teslas ability to po  st good near-term results vs the plan                20
      they laid out during their IPO marketing, grow the powertrain business, and hit key              16
      milestones with respect to the Model S development.  The strong execution gives                  12
      us increased confidence for an on-time launch of the Model S in mid-2012, which                   6/10                                                          12/10

      We noted the following positives from Teslas earnings release and                             Performance (%)        1m                          3m                       12m

      1) According to management, the Mode l S is essentially 100% sourced and the                  
      company has already produced 15 Alpha prot otypes.  This is  marginally ahead of               Stock & option liquidity data 
      our expectations at this point. 2) The Powertrain business continues to grow.                  Market Cap (USDm)                                                           2,178.7
      Based on Tesla's comments, it appears th at a production contract for the Toyota               Shares outstanding (m)                                                            95.4

      and Tesla is likely in the best position to  win a production contract for the Smart           Option volume (und. shrs., 1M avg.)       
      Fortwo EV. 3) Tesla announced that they   now plan to have enough capacity to                 
      produce 20k units of the Model S on one shift, compared to their original 10k units 
      per shift plan. This will drive higher up-front  capital costs, but substantial labor and 
      overhead savings.  We have been a bit   concerned with the companys targeted 
      25% gross margin, but this type of action increases our confidence        . 
      Tesla indicated that they may raise additional capital as early as late 2011 
      Tesla's management mentioned that th ey may look to raise $100MM-$150MM of 
      additional capital to fund   the development of Model X (a crossover vehicle 
      developed off the Model S platform). This may be perceived by investors as an 
      indication that the company is worried about liquidity and may have 
      underestimated the capital that needs to be deployed to develop automobiles. We 
      believe the company has ample liquidity to make it through 2012 and that if TSLA 
      does raise capital in 2011 to fund the        Model X, it would likely be to support 
      accelerated timing for the launch of that ve hicle. This could actually be a positive, 
      as we believe that it is critical for Tesla to broaden its vehicle portfolio in front of 
      major EV competition from more established automakers. 
      Our $21.50 target price is based on a Discounted Cash Flow analysis 
      Our DCF assumes a 7% terminal growth rate, a terminal EBIT margin of 11.9% 
      and a weighted average cost of capital of  13.5% (cost of equity: 15.0% / cost of 
      debt: 3.3%). Key downside risks include ex ecution on the scale up from niche to 
      volume manufacturing and demand / avg  trans price assumptions. Upside could 
      be derived from higher-than-expected Mo          del S volumes or potential for the 
      Powertrain business to be a long-term earnings generator.

15 February 2011       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                       

                                Tesla Motors reported 4Q10 EPS of -$0.47 (excluding stock-based comp) vs DB estimate of -
                                $0.54.  The bulk of the variance was related   to gross profit ($11MM vs DBe of $7.4MM), 
                                driven by better powertrain revenue ($9MM      vs our $5MM forecast) and unusually high 
                                margin on development services (driven by  mismatch of timing between revenue and cost 
                                recognition).  The company provided 2011   revenue guidance of $160MM-$175MM, which 
                                compares to $145MM run rate in 4Q10, co        nsensus of $152MM, and our estimate of 
                                $174MM.  We are maintaining our FY2011 / 2012 EPS estimates of -$2.08 / -$1.11 (wed note 
                                that this excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense). 

                                Overall, we continue to be impressed with Teslas ability to post good near-term results vs 
                                the plan they laid out during their IPO market ing, grow the powertrain business, and hit key 
                                milestones with respect to the Model S deve      lopment.  The strong execution gives us 
                                increased confidence for an on-time launch of   the Model S in mid-2012.  Additionally, the 
                                company announced that they are increasing  Model S capital spending in 2011 (guidance is 
                                $190MM-$215MM vs our forecast of $130MM).  In addition to deferral from the 2010 plan of 
                                ~$20MM, the higher spending is to enab         le increased component in-sourcing and, 
                                importantly, to enable Model S capacity of   20k units on only one shift (compared to their 
                                original plan of 10k units per shift).  These increased investments should pay dividends in 
                                terms of unit costs, which increases our confidence in the 25% targeted gross margin for the 
                                Model S.   

                                Based on these positives, weve made adjust ments to the out-year volumes and margins in 
                                our DCF model which results in a higher valuation.   We are raising our target price to $21.50 
                                from $17 and maintaining our Hold rating based on valuation.   

                                We noted the following key positives in Teslas earnings release and conference call: 

                                    Execution has been very strong vs. the plan   laid out during market ing for TSLAs June 
                                    IPO.  According to management, the Mo      del S is essentially 100% sourced and the 
                                    company has already produced 15 Alpha prototy  pes.  This is marginally ahead of our 
                                    expectations at this point.   Based on discussions with comp any engineers at the Detroit 
                                    Auto Show, there do not appear to have b  een any major stumbling blocks discovered 
                                    during the prototype build, whic h is impressive.  Additiona lly, although we believe the 
                                    actual near-term results are largely irrelevant, we believe it is important that Tesla has put 
                                    up strong results vs the plan they laid out during the marketing for their June 2010 IPO.   

                                    The Powertrain business continues to grow.    Based on Tesla's comments, it appears 
                                    that a production contract for the Toyota RAV4 is imminent (the company currently has a 
                                    $69MM development contract) and Tesla is likely in the best position to win a production 
                                    contract for the Smart Fortwo EV.  Additi onally, the company commented that theyve 
                                    had substantive discussions with other automa kers but may limit themselves to current 
                                    contracts, so as to not take resources aw    ay from the Model S development.  We 
                                    continue to be cautious about the sustainability of Teslas powertrain business (our belief 
                                    is that Teslas OEM customers will develop  their own technology over time), but in the 
                                    near-term contracts for three Daimler vehicles  (Smart Fortwo, Mercedes A-Class, and a 
                                    Freightliner truck) and the Toyota RAV4 a   re providing a significan t validation of the 
                                    technology to be used in Teslas own vehi    cles and an important liquidity boost (we 
                                    forecast approximately $35MM of annual gross profit in 2011 and 2012).   

                                    Tesla announced that they now plan to have enough capacity to produce 20k units of the 
                                    Model S on one shift, compared to their orig inal 10k units per shift plan.  This will drive 
                                    higher up-front capital costs, but will save  in labor costs (signifi cantly less headcount in 
                                    the one shift than the original plan for tw o shifts) and overhead (keeping the plant open 
                                    for two shifts would have driven significant overhead costs), each of which will show up 
                                    in higher variable margins.  We have been  a bit concerned with the companys targeted 
                                    25% gross margin, but this type of action increases our confidence.

15 February 2011       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                       

                                Tesla indicated that they may raise additional capital as early as late 2011 
                                Tesla's management mentioned that they ma y look to raise $100MM-$150MM of additional 
                                capital to fund the developmen t of Model X (a crossover vehi cle developed off the Model S 
                                platform).  Although a headline came across to   this effect a few days ago, we expect that 
                                some investors may take this (along with the  increased 2011 Capex outlook) as an indication 
                                that the company is worried about liquidity   and may have underestima ted the capital that 
                                needs to be deployed to develop automobiles.   

                                We believe that the company has ample liquidit y to make it through  2012.  As of 12/31/10, 
                                the company had $571MM of available liquidit y ($178MM of cash and $393MM available on 
                                its DOE loan).  Were expecting a cash burn  of $466MM over the next 6 quarters ($78MM 
                                per quarter), a substantial increase from the $58MM burn rate in 2010.  We believe that if the 
                                company does raise capital to  fund the Model X, it would li kely be to support accelerated 
                                timing for the launch of that vehicle.  Considering our belief that it is critical for Tesla to 
                                broaden its vehicle portfolio in front of major EV competition from more established 
                                automakers, we would consider this type of acceleration a positive development. 

                                Valuation / Risks 

                                Our price target is based on a DCF analys      is. Valuing Tesla presents a unique set of 
                                challenges, given the fact that company revenue won't accelerate until 2012 and beyond. We 
                                believe that DCF is the most appropriate valuation method in this case. We assume 7% 
                                terminal growth beginning in 2020 (given our proje ction that Tesla will still be building out its 
                                vehicle portfolio and that only 9.5% of global sales will be vehicles able to be fueled from the 
                                grid in 2020, we believe that a 7% growth rate   is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT 
                                margin of 11.9% and a weighted average cost  of capital of 13.5% (we calculate WACC by 
                                using 15% cost of equity and 3.3% cost of   DOE debt and weight this over the expected 
                                capital structure from 2010 - 2014). 

                                Key downside risks include execution on the sc ale up from niche to volume manufacturing, 
                                risks associated with demand and average tran  saction price assumptions, risks associated 
                                with costs projections, and unknowns associated  with the future competitive landscape. In 
                                addition, we anticipate  limited near term revenue/earni   ngs to support the stock and, 
                                consequently, we anticipate that Tesla's shares ca n exhibit high levels of near term volatility. 
                                Upside could be derived from higher-than-ex pected Model S volumes or Powertrain sales 
                                contract wins. Given volumes of competitor ve  hicles in the 50k - 200k range, there is the 
                                potential for Tesla Model S volume to be sign      ificantly higher-than- expected. Additional

price of any stock.
