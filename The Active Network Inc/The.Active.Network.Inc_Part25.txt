Active to be able to achieve scale efficiencies across most of its expense lines,
particularly COGS and R&D. We believe R&D spend should be able to decline
to a mid-teens rate (versus 22% in 2010) as Active rolls off its legacy platforms.
We  also  expect  significant  leverage  in  COGS  over  time,  benefiting  from  call
center integration, Web hosting scale, and moving to a self-serve model.

Investment Thesis  
 
Leadership Position in Underpenetrated Market.  We believe Active is the clear leader today in providing Web-based 
reservations in the four key verticals it serves today: sports, community activities, outdoors, and business events. As the 
market leader with the most scale (70 million reservations in 2010), we believe Active is able to invest significantly more 
resources than competitors in both its technology and marketing to organizations and consumers. Furthermore, Active 
estimates a North American Technology Fee market opportunity of $10B, indicating Active had less than 2.5% market 
share  in  2010.  Similarly,  Active  estimates  it  had  approximately  5%  of  North  American  customers  and  5%  of  total 
registrations in 2010. In total, we estimate that the market is approximately 10% penetrated online today. This compares 
to more mature markets in the United States, such as online travel reservations, which we estimate have over 50% online 
penetration.     
 
Strong Value Proposition for Organizations and Consumers.  We believe  Active Network provides a strong value 
proposition for both organizations (its customers) as well as consumers. Historically, many organizations have relied on 
paper-based systems or simple spreadsheet applications to manage events and registrations. Additionally, organizations 
typically have taken reservations by phone or walk-up registrations. For organizations, Active Network has developed an 
automated Web-based  platform  to  enable  organizations  to  manage  events  and  registrations  more  efficiently,  thereby 
saving resources and enabling the organization to focus on its core competencies of running the event. Actives solutions 
also enable an organization to attract additional participants and improve conversion rates. For instance, Active estimates 
that for the New York City Triathlon, it delivered a 469% ROI through both cost savings and additional revenues. For 
consumers, we believe the two key advantages of Actives platform are to discover new events through Actives directory 
as well as providing a fast Web-based solution for registering for events.   
 
Beneficiary of Network Effect. We believe Active is a clear beneficiary of the network effect, which we believe will 
enable Active to enjoy scale efficiencies over smaller competitors. We believe the network effect occurs as 1) Active adds 
new organizations, 2) the additional organizations lead to more participants to book online at either the organizations 
website or though one of Actives sites, and 3) the growth of registrations attracts new potential customers.

                                                                                                  Company Report           

                                                    
 
 
Highly Predictable Revenue Model.  In 2010, 85% of Actives revenues were technology based, for which the revenues 
are highly predictable. For its technology solutions, Active typically signs three-year contracts, and enjoys less than 5% 
annual  registration  revenue  churn,  which  we  believe  is  an  indication  of  the  high  ROI  it  delivers  to  organizations. 
Additionally,  while  most  revenues  are  transaction  based,  based  on  historical  events,  Active  has  strong  insights  into 
forward-booking trends.     
 
Multiple Growth Drivers Should Drive Mid-Teens Long-Term Revenue Growth.  We believe Active has numerous 
growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term revenue growth, including the following: 1) growth in the number of 
customers (approximately 5% today of market); 2) growth in online penetration (in its most mature Triathlon market, Active 
has 36% online penetration with participants versus 2% online penetration in total; 3) the ability to provide additional 
modules  to  customers  as  well  as  marketing  services  solutions;  4)  we  expect  Active  to  remain  acquisitive,  acquiring 
companies to bolster its market positions in current verticals, expand into additional verticals, or add additional technology 
solutions;  5)  expand  internationallywe  believe  the  international  opportunity  should  be  at  least  as  large  as  the  U.S. 
market, although it represents less than 3% of revenues today; 6) increase eCommerce offerings (i.e., Active recently 
launched Daily Deals [Schwaggle] for which it plans to launch in 25 cities by the end of 2011).  
 
Highly Scalable Model Should Lead to Significant EBITDA Margin Expansion and Growth. While EBITDA margins 
were just 9% in 2010, we believe margins can potentially reach 30% or higher longer term. We expect Active to be able to 
achieve  scale  efficiencies  across  most  of  its  expense  lines,  particularly  COGS  and  R&D.  In  particular,  we  note  that 
approximately 35% of Actives 2010 R&D spend was spent on legacy platforms. We believe R&D spend should be able to 
decline to a mid-teens rate as Active rolls off its legacy platforms.  We also expect significant leverage in COGS over time, 
benefiting from call center integration, Web hosting scale, and moving to a self-serve model.

Marketing Services Revenue. We estimate Marketing Services Revenues of $43.9M in 2011 and $51.3M in 2012, 
growth of 4.7% and 17.0%, respectively . The key drivers for marketing services include Online Services, Commerce, 
and Field Marketing. We expect Online Services to benefit from online advertising growth including email, search, and 
social. We expect Commerce to benefit from growth of membership programs, growth of registration platforms, and Daily 
Deals adoption (Schwaggle). We expect Field Services to benefit from the growth of access to events, activities, facilities, 
and consumers.    
 
Gross Margins.  Cost of revenues for Active consists of credit card processing fees, payroll and related costs, customer 
support and call center expenses, and amortization of capitalized software. We estimate gross margins of 57.4% in 2011 
and 59.1% in 2012, versus 56.6% in 2010. We expect gross margins to expand in both 2011 and 2012 driven by call 
center integration, scale in Web hosting, and the rollout of self set up. We believe gross margins can expand to the low 
60s longer term.    
 
Operating Expenses.  We expect total operating expense (excluding SBC) to remain relatively flat as a percentage of 
revenues in 2011 versus 2010 given public company costs and continued high levels of technology investments. We 
expect increased operating expense leverage in 2012 and beyond.      
 
   •   Sales and Marketing.  We expect Sales and Marketing expenses to account for 21.3% of revenue in 2011 and 
       20.3% in 2012 versus 20.9% in 2010. We expect Sales and Marketing to increase modestly as a percentage of 
       revenue in 2011 given significant investments in headcount. Longer term, we expect S&M expenses in the high-
       teens as a percentage of revenues.

    •   Research and Development.  We expect Research and Development expenses to account for 21.3% of revenue 
        in 2011 and 20.3% in 2012, versus 21.8% in 2010. We expect modest leverage in R&D in 2011 and increased 
        leverage in 2012 as the platform scales and investments in legacy platforms begins to decline. Longer term, we 
        expect R&D to represent approximately 15% of revenues.      
     
    •   General and Administrative.  We expect General and Administrative expenses to account for 13.6% of revenue 
        in 2011 and 13.5% in 2012, versus 13.6% in 2010. We expect G&A expenses to remain flat in 2011 despite 
        increased public company costs and then to decline as a percentage of revenue in 2012 and to decline to the 
        10% range longer term.

EBITDA.  We  expect  EBITDA  of  $32.8M  in  2011  and  $53.5M  in  2012,  representing  increases  of  30.2%  and  63.0%, 
respectively.  We  expect  just  modest  EBITDA  margin  leverage  in  2011  given  increased  public  company  costs,  and 
investments  in  S&M  and  the  ActiveWorks  platform. And  we  expect  increased  EBITDA  margin  leverage  in  2012  and 
beyond as Active benefits from scale efficiencies and legacy technology investments begin to decline.

Valuation 
 
We arrive at a $23 per-share price target for Active based on 26x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $53.5M. We believe a 26x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth, and 30% and 63% EBITDA growth in 2011 and 
2012, respectively. Our price target also equates to 22x our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $75.7M, discounted back to 2012 at 
12%.   
 
Our $23 price target is also justified by a DCF analysis. In our 10-year DCF analysis, we have assumed a revenue CAGR 
(2011-2020)  of  14%  and  an  EBITDA  CAGR  of  30%.  Additionally,  we  estimate  a  FCF  CAGR  (2012-2020)  of  41%.    
Furthermore, we have assume a weighted average cost of capital of 11.7%, FCF growth in perpetuity  of 5%, and a 
terminal FCF multiple of 15x.

Relative to shares of a peer group of leading eCommerce companies, Active shares trade at a 2012E EV/EBITDA multiple 
of  20x versus 15x for the peer group. While Active shares trade at a premium, we believe the premium is justified given 
our higher long-term growth estimate for Active. We estimate Actives long-term earnings growth at approximately 35% 
versus the peer group at 22%, and, hence, Active shares trade at a 2012E EV/EBITDA/Growth multiple of 0.6x, in line 
with the peer group at 0.7x.

                                                                                                 Company Report          

                                                    
 
Business  Segments.  Active  Network  reports  revenues  under  Technology  revenues  as  well  as  Marketing  Services 
revenues. For 2010, Technology revenues represented 85% of the total while Marketing Services represented 15% of 
revenues.    
 
    •   Technology revenue.  Technology revenues consist of registration revenues (83% of Technology revenues in 
        2010) as well as software license, maintenance, and hosting revenues.   
            o   Registration  revenues.  Registration  fees  are  typically  based  on  a  percentage  of  the  total  dollars 
                processed for a registration and typically have both a fixed and variable component. Active Networks 
                typical contract length for registration customers is three years. In 2010, Active processed 70.2 million 
                transactions  for  47,300  organizations  totaling  $197.6  million  in  registration  revenues  or  $2.28  per 
                registration.  
            o   Licensed   software,   maintenance,   hosting,   and   implementation   revenues.  Licensed   software, 
                maintenance, hosting, and implementation fees accounted for 17% of technology revenues in 2010. We 
                expect these revenues to decline as a percentage of revenues over time as the company transitions 
                customers to transaction-based solutions.     
     
    •   Marketing Services revenues. Marketing Services accounted for 15% of 2010 total revenues. The Marketing 
        Services segment provides customers with 1) online services (e.g., email, targeted newsletter promotions); 2) field 
        marketing (e.g., event promotions and sponsorships); 3) commerce revenue (e.g., membership programs, training 
        programs, and websites). The contract length for Marketing Services customers is typically less than one year.   
 
 
Acquisitions.  Active Network has been pursuing growth though acquisition strategy  to  expand into new categories and 
geographies over the last several years. Below we list some of the companys major acquisitions.

                                                                                                  Company Report           

                                                    
 
 
Market Opportunity 
 
North American Technology Market Opportunity.  Active Network estimates that there are 800,000 potential customers 
in North America across its four key customer groups: sports, community, outdoors, and business events. Based on this, 
Active has approximately 5-6% market share of potential customers. Furthermore, Active Network estimates that its target 
market includes over 1.8 billion annual registrations in the United States (Active estimates it processes approximately 5% 
of registrations today), representing $110 billion in registration spending. Assuming a 9% take rate, which we believe is 
reasonable, this would equate to a potential North American market of roughly $10 billion in revenues.    
 
Triathlon Market Shows Potential of Platform.  Active Networks most developed segment is the triathlon market, which 
the company estimates that it works with 60% of the triathlon organizations and over 60% of those participants transacting 
online, suggesting Active registers 36% of triathlon participants in North America. In contrast, Active estimates that it 
processes  just  2%  of  total  registrations,  suggesting  a  significant  opportunity  if  Active  can  continue  to  increase  its 
penetration rates in the less mature markets.   
 
Marketing Services Opportunity.  Active estimates that its North American Marketing Services opportunity is $10 billion, 
equivalent to the size of its technology revenues. We note that in Actives most mature endurance vertical, nearly half of 
its revenues come from marketing services fees.    
 
International  Opportunity.  While  still  small  today  (less  than  5%  of  2010  revenues),  Active  believes  the  longer-term 
opportunity for International (primarily Europe and APAC) should be as large as the North American market.    
 
Growth Drivers 
 
We believe Active Networks should benefit from numerous growth drivers, which we believe should enable Active to 
achieve mid-teens long-term revenue growth.     
 
    •   Increase   number   of   organizations .   In   2010,   Active   worked   with   approximately   47,000  organizations, 
        representing  approximately  5%  of  its  potential  customer  base.  We  believe  that  through  increased  sales  and 
        marketing, and continued adoption of Web-based solutions, the company should be able to significantly increase 
        its organization count over the long term.  
 
    •   Increase Online Penetration.  Of the organizations that Active works with, approximately 20% transact online 
        today. We expect this percentage to increase significantly longer term through increased training of its customer 
        base, increased awareness of Actives websites, and emerging forms of marketing including social and mobile.  
        We note that in the companys triathlon segment, approximately 60% of registrations are online today. We note 
        that higher online penetration should also increase Actives revenue per customer.  
 
    •   International.  International  represented  less  than  5%  of  revenues  in  2010,  though  we  believe  Active  has  a 
        significant opportunity to expand internationally, primarily Europe and APAC. We believe Active will focus on the 
        endurance and corporate events categories initially.  
 
    •   Additional  Vertical  Markets.  We  believe  there  is  an  opportunity  to  expand  into  other  markets  whereby  its 
        technology platform can deliver similar benefits to a specific market vertical.  For example, Active recently entered 
        the faith-based category through the acquisition of Fellowship Technologies, whereby it added 1,700 churches as 
        clients.    
 
    •   Sell Additional Modules to Installed Base.  We expect Active to focus on cross-selling additional modules into 
        its  installed  base,  encompassing  both  technology  and  marketing  solutions.  We  note  that  marketing  services 
        represent nearly 50% of endurance category revenues but only 15% of total revenues, and, hence, we believe 
        there is an opportunity to further cross-sell these solutions into its other verticals. Additionally, we expect Active to 
        cross-sell technology solutions such as call-center services and survey services.    

                                                                                                                            
 

                                                                                                                Page 11
                                                                                                                       234

                                                                                                            July 5, 2011  
                                                                                                  Company Report           

                                                    
 
    •   Acquisitions.  We  expect  Active  to  remain  acquisitive  in  order  to  gain  further  market  share  in  its  current 
        categories, expand into additional categories, and expand internationally.   
 
    •   Daily  Deals.  We  expect  Active  to  aggressively  expand  its  group  buying  platform  Schwaggle  to  additional 
        geographies.  Schwaggle offers deals on fitness-related products and services. Schwaggle  is currently  in four 
        cities (San Francisco, New York, Los Angles, and Chicago) though the company plans to roll out to a total of 25 
        cities by the end of 2011 and to select international markets in 2012. Schwaggle offers a variety of discounts from 
        endurance sports, to spas, to magazine subscriptions, to golf lessons.

Management Overview 
 
Dave Alberga,  CEO.  Mr. Alberga oversees the executive management team for all of Active Networks markets and leads 
the  general  managers  in  new  business  development.  Prior  to  Active  Network,  Mr.  Alberga  headed  operations  for 
Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., a leading portal and transaction company. Additional experience includes senior 
management  positions  with  Linear  Technology  Corporation,  Silicon  Valley  Technology  and  consulting  and  brand 
management at the Boston Consulting Group and Procter & Gamble Company. Mr. Alberga holds a Master of Business 
Administration degree and a masters degree in arts from Stanford University. He earned a bachelors degree in general 
engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point.  
.  
Matt Landa , President.  Mr. Landa heads all operations including strategy, sales, professional services, technology, and 
financial execution. Prior to Active Network, Mr. Landa was president and chief executive officer of Silicon Valley-based 
CMC Industries. Prior to CMC Industries, Mr. Landa was chief operating officer of Silicon Valley Technology (SVT), a 
high-volume  manufacturer  of  electronics  products.  Additional  experience  includes  serving  as  an  associate  of  Monitor 
Company, a strategic consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Landa holds a Master of Business Administration 
degree  from  Stanford  University  and  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  from  Dartmouth  College  with  concentrations  in 
engineering and economics. 
 
Scott Mendel  , Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Mendel is responsible for Active Networks corporate finance, accounting, 
and  investor  relations  functions.  Prior  to  joining  Active  Network,  Mr.  Mendel  worked  in  finance  positions  for  General 
Electric (GE) for over 20 years. In his most recent position, chief financial officer for GEs Healthcare IT division, he led a 
150-person global finance function and headed up the financial due diligence and integration of a $1.2 billion acquisition in 
2006.  Mendel  received  his  undergraduate  degree  in  finance  from  Indiana  University  and  his  Master  of  Business 
Administration degree from Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management.

served as chief operating officer from April 2000 to February 2011. Previous to Active Network, he was co-founder and 
president of LeagueLink, a Web-based service for administering recreational sports leagues. Active acquired LeagueLink

from University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Business and a Master of Business Administration degree from 
Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management.  
 
Risks to Price Target 
 
Acquisitions.  Active has been highly acquisitive, with over 25 acquisitions over the past five years. Going forward, we 
believe the company will likely continue to be acquisitive to gain share and expand into new categories and geographies. 
While  we  believe  the  companys  track  in  integrating  acquisitions  has  been  good  thus  far,  acquisitions  always  create 
uncertainties and could be a distraction for management.  
 
Competition.  While we believe the market for Web-based reservations and activity-based software is highly fragmented, 
we  believe  the  large  and  growing  market  opportunity  is  likely  to  attract  additional  entrants.  Today,  Active  primarily 
competes with legacy registration methods such and pen and paper, mail, and phone-based reservations. Additionally, 
Active competes with internally developed software applications, off-the-shelf software (e.g., Microsoft Excel), as well as 
companies that offer Web-based solutions in one or more of its vertical areas.  
 
Slower Adoption of Web-Based Reservation Systems.  While online penetration for events and activities registration is 
still low today, which presents significant growth potential for the company, slower-than-expected online adoption from 
organizations and participants may limit Active Networks near-term growth potential.  
 
Macroeconomic Environment.   We believe the activities and events market is sensitive to consumer sentiment and the 
overall  economic  environment.  For  instance,  the  company  experienced  a  significant  slowdown  in  its  business  in  the 
second  half  of  2008  due  to  the  economic  downturn.  In  addition,  due  to  the  companys  exposure  to  the  parks  and 
recreation segment, governmental budgetary cuts could adversely impact the companys growth rates.

Transition to ActiveWorks Platform.  While we believe the companys transition from its legacy platform to PaaS-based 
ActiveWorks should drive increased efficiencies and margin expansion, the transition is time consuming and requires 
significant investment. We note that in 2010, approximately 35% of Actives research and development spending was on 
the legacy platform. We currently expect Active to transition off the legacy platform by 2014. Delays in the transition (i.e., 
difficulties in convincing customers to migrate) would likely adversely impact Actives operating leverage.    
 
Expand into New Businesses.  While we believe the ActiveWorks platform should enable the company to expand into 
new verticals, new verticals may require significant incremental investment. Additionally, new businesses may require 
additional expertise that Active may not have, and as such Active would need to invest in additional personal.  
 
International Expansion.  We expect Active to look to expand more internationally in the future, given the potentially large 
international market for Actives solutions.  That said, differences in a specific countrys culture and lack of international 
operational experience of Active could limit the companys success internationally. We believe it is likely that Active will 
look to a partner and acquisition strategy for international, which could create additional risks and uncertainties.    
 
Environmental Impact.  Actives business, especially the Outdoors vertical, could be negatively affected by environmental 
conditions.  For instance, during the Gulf oil spill in the summer of 2010, Actives outdoor growth was negatively impacted.
