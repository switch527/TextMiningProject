                                     Areas of focus for the conference call: 
                                             Cadence of sales throughout 2Q, and sales trends into 3Q12. 
                                             Updated guidance for FY12. 
                                             The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact due to 
                                               acquisitions and inflation. Additionally, some color on trends on unique customers. 
                                             Progress on transitioning to the new facility in the Bronx and to the Praml facility in 
                                               Las Vegas. 
                                             Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                               operators that Chef serves.  
                                             Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its 
                                               customers. Additionally, managements outlook for inflation especially in dairy. 
                                             Trends in case volumes and revenues per case. 
                                             Managements thoughts on the opportunity for new market entries  specifically, how 
                                               many markets the company can ultimately enter and an outline of the criteria 
                                               management uses to evaluate potential markets. 
                                             An update on the quality of the acquisition pipeline, and on the companys sense of urgency 
                                               to enter new categories such as meat, seafood, produce, direct ship pastry and supplies. 
                                             Some color on the competitive environment. 
                                             Now that the company has acquired three comp anies over the last 13 months  some 
                                               commentary on the stickiness of the acquired customers, including: how retention 
                                               levels change as the transaction ages, a ty pical percentage of customers CHEF expects 
                                               to retain one year post acquisition, and how order sizes progress. 

                                     Dairy trends in 2Q12 and projections for the remainder of 2012.                  Exhibit 2 details dairy 
                                     prices in FY12 to date, year-over-year price comparisons, as well as forecasts for the remainder 
                                     of the year. While dairy could remain deflationary for the rest of FY12  the magnitude abates 
                                     materially  as a result, we believe the dairy h eadwind could be slightly lower than previously 
                                     discussed and guided. We will ask for an update on dairy on next weeks call.

                                $9.3 million. Our estimate assumes total sales increase 19.0% to $118.1 million  driven by 
                                9.0% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 75 bp to 27.2%. We forecast 
                                operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 22.5%  to $22.9 million, or a 55 bp increase as a 
                                percentage of sales to 19.3%  leading to an 8 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.3%, or 
                                $8.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.3 million, a 20 bp expansion in margin to 7.9%. We 
                                assume interest expense of $0.4 million, a 41.0% tax rate, and 20.9 million shares outstanding, 
                                which gets us to EPS of $0.23  an 18.4% increase from 2Q11.  

                                In FY2012, our estimate is $0.91 vs. consensus of $0.91. Our EBITDA estimate is 
                                $36.6 million. Our estimate assumes total sales increase 15.2% to $461.0 million (vs. consensus 
                                of $463.1 million), with gross margins improving 67 bp to 27.0%. We forecast operating 
                                expenses (excluding D&A) grow 16.6% to $87. 8 million, a 24 bp year-over-year deterioration 
                                in margin  leading to a 39 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.4%, or $34.1 million. 
                                This gets us to EBITDA of $36.6 million, a 44 bp improvement in margin to 7.9%. We assume 
                                interest expense of $1.8 million, a 41.1% tax rate, and 20.9 million shares outstanding, which 
                                gets us to EPS of $0.91.
