 Reason for Report:
                                                 CONCLUSION:
 Company Update
                                                 We are reiterating our Overweight rating on TEA shares as we round into the new year
 Changes            Previous       Current       and in view of the significant growth prospects ahead for this high-end purveyor of
 Rating                    --   Overweight       teas and tea-related gifts. We believe Santa hauled around tea from house to house this
 Price Tgt                 --       $27.00       year and Teavana likely saw upside in their category--especially when cold-weather

                                                 term, we believe Teavana is still in the early stages of its domestic store growth, and
 FY12E Rev (mil)           --       $165.3
                                                 we are encouraged by continued e-commerce strength as well as Teavana's market
 FY13E Rev (mil)           --       $208.5

 52 Week Low                        $14.28        Price Versus Transactions? That Is The (Investor) Question. In the bulk of
 12-Month Price Target              $27.00         our note we have set aside five plausible reasons why Teavana's same-store sales
     35x FY14E EPS                                 have been largely price-driven as opposed to transaction-driven. Read on for the

                                                   fundamental flaw in their growth strategy. We believe Teavana is growing rapidly

 Book Value/Share                     $1.38        and expanding the high-end tea category in the process. Moreover, we believe their

 Debt to Total Capital                  8%         in greater quantities on subsequent, but less frequent, visits. There's no shame in

 Fiscal Year End:                      Jan        from their innovative tea blends launch in FQ3, Teavana is likely to have posted a
 Rev (mil)        2011A    2012E     2013E         solid holiday selling seasons--particularly in view of the fact that non-cold weather

 Jul               $23.0A   $31.3A   $38.7E        the lack of cold weather in which to sell such goods. This holiday at Teavana saw

 FY              $124.7A   $165.3E  $208.5E        last year. As a reminder, the holiday season is critically important to Teavana, and
 CY              $165.3A   $208.5E  $261.8E        we expect FQ4 to account for slightly more than two thirds of annual EPS in FY12

                                                   We note that management is slated to present at the 14th Annual ICR XChange

                                                 RISKS TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TARGET PRICE:
                                                 Macroeconomic pressures, risk to opening stores internationally and working with
                                                 franchise partners, reliance on key top management, limited ability to hedge costs.

                                   Teavana present on Wednesday January 11  , we thought it appropriate to address the 
    Question                     single biggest question surrounding Teavana’s investment thesis:  why are same-store sales 
                                   driven by price and not transaction?  We aim to offer our insights and why we believe 
                                   Teavana makes for a great growth story for 2012.    
                                    
                                   Question:  Why are Teavana’s same-store sales driven by price and not transactions? 
                                    
                                   Good question.  We’ve been doing a great deal of thinking in and around this common 
                                   question.  To be clear, this dynamic in the same-store sales metric have been known since 
                                   the time of the company’s initial offering roadshow; so for those coming into the story now, 
                                   know that this isn’t “new.”  The spirit of the question is valid:  in fact, we completely agree 
                                   that early-stage brands/concepts should be more transactionally driven in their sales trends 
                                   as opposed to price-driven.  That said, we struggle to conclude (as some have done on the 
                                   short side of this stock) that it is the definitive sign of a “fad” or “non-scalable concept.” 
                                    
                                   Here are some plausible reasons why Teavana’s “comps” could be more price-driven than 
                                   transactionally driven. 
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #1:  In-store beverages cloud the metric. 
                                    
                                   Teavana has historically sold prepared tea beverages in their store—almost, in our view, as 
                                   a customer service as opposed to a full-fledged customer acquisition strategy.  Though 
                                   prepared beverages currently account for only about 4% of total sales, we believe they 
                                   account for about 25% of the total transactions.  As the company has continued to de-
                                   emphasize in-store prepared tea beverages, transactions have declined.  We believe this 
                                   dynamic is leveling off and will very likely become less relevant as a potential call-out in the 
                                   same-store sales metrics as we head into the new year.

                                   Plausible Answer #2:  Marketing (aka “new customer acquisition”) has not been a focus up 
                                   until now.  Customers are tripping into Teavana, not being “advertised” into Teavana. 
                                    
                                   Yes, you read that correctly; Teavana has not yet announced a head of marketing.  We 
                                   continue to be amazed that Teavana has found success thus far without one—likely a 
                                   testament to the brand’s inherent draw—but 2012 beckons a head of marketing to be 
                                   installed in our view.  The primary reason, we believe, is wrapped up in a more cogent new 
                                   customer acquisition strategy—particularly in an as-of-yet-launched loyalty program.  
                                   Some of the best retailers and brands have a successful loyalty program—one that helps 
                                   recognize their best customers—driving frequency of visits (aka “traffic”) to stores and 
                                   higher average transaction values (aka “conversion and pricing”).  Ironically, we believe tea 
                                   drinkers are naturally loyal to the brew itself; thus we believe Teavana’s launch of a loyalty 
                                   program in 2012 would square well with this targeted customer base.   
                                    
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #3:  In-store training focuses on driving price, not transactions.

                                   intended to buy two ounces on our trip.  By the time the transaction was over, the store 
                                   associate had sold me a half-pound of tea—four times the amount we intended to buy.  
                                   How did she do that?  She suggested a blend of teas from the wall of 100 choices—which 
                                   consisted of two teas at two ounces each and one tea at four ounces.  Tack on the new tin I 
                                   just purchased and voila we spent nearly $40.  What just happened!?  Now, it will 
                                   technically take us four times the amount of time needed to consume the tea.  We surmise 
                                   that the store associate is trained and possibly paid for up selling each transaction.  Should 
                                   Teavana choose to emphasize “appetizers over entrees,” frequency (traffic/transactions) 
                                   could move higher.

                                   Plausible Answer #4:  E-commerce growing as a means to replenish tea purchasing. 
                                    
                                   Another good answer is wrapped up in the rapidly rising e-commerce channel: perhaps 
                                   “she” is being introduced into the brand at retail and then replenishing in total or in part 
                                   with her purchases online.  Not that we recommend blending e-commerce transaction 
                                   metrics into the retail transaction metrics, but we note there is a meaningful e-commerce 
                                   growth rate afoot—and it has happened without the help of a marketing director.

                                   E-commerce revenues have grown at a CAGR of 56% since FY08, and in FY11 the channel 
                                   represented 7% of sales.  Management expects to achieve 10% e-commerce penetration 
                                   longer-term, and we believe this will likely occur in the next three to four years.  The 
                                   merchandise assortment and mix between loose tea and hard goods online is comparable to 
                                   Teavana’s brick and mortar locations, and we believe that a strong majority of Teavana’s 
                                   e-commerce customers are also brick and mortar customers.  Growth of the e-commerce 
                                   channel will likely stem from new customer acquisition as Teavana grows its store base 
                                   towards 500 locations from its current total of 196.   
                                    
                                   We believe that e-commerce sales could potentially represent 12% to 15% of net sales over 
                                   the next five to seven years as multi-channel customers increasingly migrate online and as 
                                   customers utilize the website more and more as an educational tool.  Teavana has highly 
                                   functional mobile and tablet applications, including for the iPhone and iPad, which offer 
                                   full purchasing functionality, suggestions of new blends to try, and even a “tea timer” that 
                                   can tell customers when to stop steeping their tea depending on the type of tea and brewing 
                                   method. 
                                    
                                   The growing penetration of Teavana’s e-commerce business should be a natural lift to total 
                                   company operating margin, as we believe the online channel is more profitable and requires 
                                   minimal capital investment to support.  We believe that the average order size through the

                                   e-commerce channel is approximately 20% higher than in stores (excluding prepared 
                                   beverages sold through the company’s stores).  Furthermore, we believe that the recent 
                                   launch of Teavana’s auto-ship program for loose teas, which enables customers to receive 
                                   periodic deliveries on any teas at the customers’ discretion, will likely help to further 
                                   increase the merchandise mix penetration of loose tea, which could have a significant 
                                   positive impact on gross margin. 
                                    
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #5:  Teavana’s retail footprint is growing faster than the market for 
                                   specialty tea. 
                                    
                                   We expect Teavana to benefit from growth in overall U.S. tea consumption, as well as 
                                   outperformance of high-end specialty tea brands relative to mass brands typically sold 
                                   through the food, drug, and mass channel.  A number of industry groups project U.S. tea 
                                   consumption to increase at an 8% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years, and we 
                                   believe the domestic tea market is still very much in the early stages of the “high-end-
                                   ification” that has characterized previously homogeneous categories ranging from prepared 
                                   coffee to athletic apparel to cupcakes to headphones.  Whereas these categories had few 
                                   high-end, niche, or differentiated offerings widely available to consumers as recently as five 
                                   or ten years ago, we believe it is now considered commonplace among America’s upper-
                                   middle class to pay $4 for a latte from Starbucks, a $100 for a pair of lululemon yoga pants, 
                                   $5 for a Crumbs cupcake, or $70 for a pair of Skullcandy headphones.   
                                    
                                   What do these product categories all have in common?  They all target an end-use that has 
                                   widespread demographic appeal, and high-end offerings in each of these categories can 
                                   easily be marketed to or perceived by customers as having a strong value proposition, either 
                                   because of a low average ticket and opening price point (i.e. SBUX, CRMB), or because of a 
                                   low “dollars per use” ratio (i.e. LULU, SKUL).  We believe that tea could be undergoing a 
                                   similar transformation, with high-end specialty brands likely to substantially outpace the 
                                   overall category growth rate for the foreseeable future.  In addition to widespread 
                                   demographic appeal, we believe Teavana can easily communicate its value proposition to 
                                   upper-income customers who see themselves as savvy, cost-conscious consumers.  After all, 
                                   two ounces of Teavana’s basic loose teas cost under $4, and one could reasonably expect a 
                                   $200 cast iron teapot to last for decades and sustain hundreds (or even thousands) of uses. 
                                    
                                   According to the Tea Association of the USA, specialty tea consumption at the wholesale 
                                   level has grown at a CAGR of 17% per year over the past decade.  Assuming a solid finish 
                                   to the year, Teavana’s sales have grown at a compound annual rate of 37% since 2006 
                                   (FY07).

                                    they stand to nearly, solely benefit from the “catch up” of the market for high-end tea.  In 
                                    the meantime, and in concert with the potential, plausible reasons enumerated above, 
                                    TEA’s same-store sales metrics may optically continue to be price-driven versus transaction 
                                    count-driven.  And we’re okay with this dynamic.   
                                     
                                     
                                     
    Un-modeled                   Our published EPS estimates for Teavana call for a CAGR of approximately 35% over the 
    Opportunity: CPG             next three years--well above the growth rates for most of its specialty retail peers.  
    Business                      However, we believe much of TEA’s incremental value lies beyond the scope of our model, 
                                    which is based only on the company’s existing brick and mortar and e-commerce channels.  
                                    Longer-term, we believe that Teavana could launch a viable consumer packaged goods 
                                    (CPG) line, which would leverage the company’s supply-chain capabilities and likely entail 
                                    minimal incremental overhead expense.   
                                     
                                    We believe Teavana is a strong candidate for a CPG line for several reasons.  As is the case 
                                    with the brick and mortar specialty channel, the competitive landscape for high-end teas in 
                                    the domestic CPG market is highly fragmented and the larger players primarily focus on tea 
                                    bags instead of loose tea.  Teavana’s price points and brand positioning would make it a 
                                    strong partner, in our opinion, for high-end grocery or natural foods stores.  Furthermore, 
                                    with Teavana on a trajectory to exceed $100 million in revenue from loose tea sales alone 
                                    next year, we believe Teavana’s scale and sourcing efficiencies would enable it to offer 
                                    high-end grocery stores a branded wholesale CPG offering at favorable economics relative 
                                    to the grocer pursuing a private label offering. 
                                     
                                    In the exhibit below, we have illustrated what we believe the potential impact of a CPG 
                                    business could be for Teavana.  Given the high merchandise margins Teavana enjoys on its 
                                    loose teas, we believe that even after taking into account packaging and other variable 
                                    product costs, Teavana would likely achieve very high product margins on a CPG line.  We 
                                    believe that Teavana could likely add $0.09 to EPS longer-term, depending on its ability to 
                                    secure distribution to a sufficient number of doors.  To be clear, these projections are not

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
