                                 Company Description 

                                 Company description.      Ridgefield, Connecticut-based Chefs Warehouse is a distributor of 
                                 specialty food products to menu-driven independ  ent restaurants, fine dining establishments, 
                                 country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. Reported sales in 
                                 FY2010 were $330.1 million. The company serves its 7,000 customer locations through six 
                                 distribution centers in New York City (representing ~66% of sales, and ~80% of EBITDA in 
                                 FY2010), Los Angeles, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami. Its 
                                 distribution centers carry up to 11,500 specialty and broadline SKUs  50% of which are 
                                 imported.  

                                         Specialty SKUs represent the majority of all SKUs offered to its customers. Examples 
                                           include artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, hormone-free 
                                           protein, truffles, caviar, and chocolate.  Chefs Warehouse competes on these SKUs 
                                           with regional, specialty distributors. 

                                         Broadline SKUs consist of more commoditized products such as cooking oils, butter, 
                                           eggs, milk, and flour. Chefs Warehouse competes on these products with other 
                                           broadline foodservice distributors such as Sysco, U.S. Foodservice, and Performance 
                                           Food Group. 

                                 Independent restaurants account for approximately 65.5% of sales, followed by hotels and 
                                 casinos at 8.6% of sales.

                                 In 2010, we estimate dairy accounted for approximately 24.5% of sales, followed by meat, 
                                 seafood, and charcuterie at 18.1%. The company  s penetration in cut protein and produce is 
                                 currently very limited but represents an opportunity  once the larger facility in the Bronx comes 
                                 on line. Private label accounts for 15% of sales  although penetration in private label is much 
                                 higher in dairy and butter.

                                 Our Thesis  

                                 We are initiating coverage on Chefs Warehouse with an  OUTPERFORM      rating and a $16 price 
                                 target. Our rating and price target are based on our belief that Chefs Warehouse should trade at 
                                 a premium to Sysco given the stronger top-line growth, but at a discount to United Natural 
                                 Foods given the lack of visibility on the top line, as well as the lack of geographic 
                                 diversification. We like the story for several reasons: 1) the industry is extremely fragmented 
                                 and Chefs Warehouse is well positioned to play a dominant role in industry consolidation; 
                                 2) Chefs Warehouse has significant opportunity to expand in existing markets with very little 
                                 capital investment required; 3) ROIC is high at 24.3%  and will likely increase as capacity 
                                 utilization outside of the Bronx increases; 4) the stock has significantly underperformed its 
                                 peers and the S&P since the IPO; and 5) free cash flow yield - at ~8% by FY13 (but lower in 
                                 2012 owing to the Bronx relocation)  will be allocated to acquisitions as well as debt 
                                 reduction. CHEF is trading at a FY12 (ending  December 2012) EV/EBITDA of 8.1x  an 11% 
                                 premium to SYY and a 13% discount to UNFI  and FY12 P/E of 13.7x.    

                                 Valuation 

                                 We limited our valuation comparisons to Sysco and United Natural Foods. As of closing prices 
                                 on September 2, 2011, CHEF was trading at an 11% premium to SYYs EV/EBITDA 
                                 valuation, and a 13% discount to UNFIs EV/EBITDA valuation. For all three companies, we 
                                 are using calendar 2012 EBITDA and EPS estimates. At our $16 price target  we value CHEF 
                                 at a FY12 EV/EBITDA of 9.4x and a P/E of 16.2x.  SYY is currently trading at a calendar 2012 
                                 EV/EBITDA of 7.3x and a P/E of 12.8x. UNFI  at  our $41 price target  is valued at a FY12 
                                 EV/EBITDA of 10.4x and P/E of 21.1x. In addition , since July 28, 2011  CHEFs first day of 
                                 trading  the stock has significantly underperformed SYY, UNFI and the S&P500  giving 
                                 further credence to our OUTPERFORM    rating. Please refer to Exhibit 6 for relative performance 
                                 measures.

                                      Exhibit 8 highlights how Chefs Warehouse compares to both Sysco and United Natural Foods 
                                      on a range of metrics we view as relevant. The companys top line is clearly superior to Sysco's 
                                       but lack of visibility on the top line, as well as an overwhelming geographic exposure to the 
                                      New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut markets pose some risk. In total, Chefs Warehouse 
                                      ranks favorably to Sysco on four metrics, similarly on six metrics, and worse on two metrics. 
                                      Compared to United Natural Foods, Chefs Warehouse ranks favorably on three metrics, 
                                      similarly on six, and worse on four. Clearly some of these rankings are subjective  so our 
                                      comments explain the thought process behind our rankings. In conclusion, we believe that our 
                                      rating and price target accurately reflect these rankings.

                                        A Long Runway for Growth: Longer-Term Growth Potential 
                                        Outweighs Risk of Near-Term Slow Down   

                                        Using the Bronx facilitys capacity utilization as a proxy for potential sales at the rest of the 
                                        distribution centers, we estimate Chefs Warehouse could reach total sales of $839 million 
                                        without incremental capital expenditures. Exhibit 9 below details current regional revenue and 
                                        EBITDA contributions, as well as sales per square foot.

                                        Growing Share in Existing Markets  

                                        If we assume each facility can reach the same level of productivity as the Bronx facility  
                                        or sales per square foot in the $1,480 range  we believe revenues at the facilities 
                                        excluding the Bronx could reach $321 million  more than double the current run rate.                              
                                        Exhibit 10 looks at current capacity utilization on sales per square foot, and potential sales 
                                        assuming $1,480 in sales per square foot at the other facilities. In Miami  we use 30,000 
                                        square feet for our potential sales calculation because the facilitys expansion will be completed 
                                        shortly.

                                     Market Analysis Supports our Potential Revenue Estimates  

                                     Given our estimates for total sales potential in existing markets, we decided to analyze 
                                     each market using population and income levels to see if, in fact, our estimates for Chefs' 
                                     Warehouse revenue potential were realistic. We use the New York market as a 
                                     benchmark for this analysis.      By our estimate, the broader New York market has a population 
                                     of 4.29 million people earning in excess of $150,000 in annual income. We assume this is the 
                                     target market for the fancy and family dini      ng crowd, although we acknowledge we are 
                                     probably underestimating the size of the mark         et. Our analysis tells us Chefs' Warehouse 
                                     revenues in the New York market will reach $60.30 per person ($259 million total sales in the 
                                     tri-state area) in 2011 for the >$150,000 population.

                                        Using this base revenue per person in the >$150,000 income demographic, we looked at Chefs' 
                                        Warehouse five remaining markets to determine sales potential assuming similar levels of 
                                        penetration. For population, we use both U.S. Census and Metro Market Studies data. Our 
                                        findings are summarized in Exhibit 13. We estimate total dollar sales could reach $516 million 
                                        (versus estimated capacity of $321 million). Our $516 million estimate is also very conservative 
                                        because population estimates for vacation destinations (e.g., Las Vegas and Miami) consider 
                                        only full-time residents, and so are significantly understated.

                                      New Market Revenue Potential Is at Least $270 Million 

                                      The methodology for our analysis of sales potential for new markets is similar to our analysis of 
                                      existing markets. We identified Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Houston as markets with 
                                      sufficient concentration of the  menu-driven restaurants that ar e needed to support a market-
                                      entry. We use the same $60.30 per person with incomes over $150,000 in each market. Based

                                      Assuming similar levels of productivity as at the New York facility, we estimate the company 
                                      would need to expand distribution center square footage by 184,000 to meet the $270 million

                                       Historical Success With Acquisitions Gives Us Confidence 
                                       Chefs Warehouse Can Expand Successfully in New Markets  

                                       A key component of the companys growth strategy has been and likely will continue to be the 
                                       pursuit of select acquisitions, and the companys   integration track record gives us confidence 
                                       the company can execute on additional acquisitions. The company entered the Washington 
                                       D.C., San Francisco, and Miami markets through acquisitions, and in June 2011, Chefs' 
                                       Warehouse completed a tuck-in acquisition of one of its smaller competitors in the New York 
                                       market. The companys superior technology pr              ovides Chefs Wareho  use with a critical 
                                       competitive advantage  facilitating seamless and immediate integration  usually within 24-48 
                                       hours of finalizing a transaction. Please see Exhibit 17 for a list of recent acquisitions and our

                                       The foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating, which should provide 
                                       Chefs' Warehouse with plenty of potential acquisition opportunities. Key markets that come to 
                                       mind include Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Criteria for new markets versus tuck-in 
                                       acquisitions vary slightly and are detailed in Exhibit 18.

                                  To some extent, the companys ability to make accretive acquisitions will be a function of 
                                  acquisition multiples. Prior acquisitions have   been extremely accretive  in part because 
                                  acquisition multiples have been well below where CHEF is currently trading (1x) as a multiple 
                                  of sales. We caution that CHEFs IPO provid     es sellers with some ammunition on where a 
                                  specialty distributor should be valued  making future negotiations potentially a little more 
                                  contentious.   

                                  Organic Growth Not Immune to Economic Slowdown 
                                  While we believe the current environment is unlikely to deteriorate by the same order of 
                                  magnitude as the deterioration seen in 4Q08 through 3Q09, we do believe Chefs' Warehouse 
                                  exposure to the tri-state area poses some risk. On  the most recent conference call, the company 
                                  indicated organic sales remained unchanged from the 13% run rate seen in 2Q11. However, 
                                  1) inflation/mix decelerated from 4.9% in 1Q11 to 3.3% in 2Q11  while inflation remained 
                                  unchanged  so the deceleration was entirely du   e to a decline in mix; and 2) the company 
                                  experienced significant sales declines beginning in 4Q08 through 3Q09, coinciding with the 
                                  deteriorating economic environment. Today, the high-end customer appears more or less 
                                  unaffected, but if the current environment persists, it seems unlikely that Chefs Warehouse will 
                                  be unaffected.  

                                  Exhibit 19 below details the companys organic and total sales growth rates from 1Q08-2Q11. 
                                  Beginning in 4Q08, organic sales deteriorated significantly and remained negative for four 
                                  consecutive quarters. Today, we believe Chefs Warehouse has significantly upgraded systems 
                                  and technology to more rapidly identify changes in their customers ordering patterns, so we 
                                  believe a slowdown of the same 2008/2009 magnitude is unlikely, but caution that organic sales 
                                  could still slow slightly given the current uncertainty in the environment.

                                 Chefs Warehouse in More Detail                    

                                 A long history of serving the New York market and a gradual, national expansion though 
                                 select and accretive acquisitions culminated with the successful July 27, 2011 IPO    .     In 
                                 1985, Chefs Warehouse (formerly known as Dairyland USA) was founded as a niche, specialty 
                                 food provider to chefs in the New York metropolitan area. Since then, the company has grown 
                                 to have a presence in six different markets. The company has completed multiple acquisitions in 
                                 its history, with acquisitions in 1999 (Washington, D.C. market); 2005 (Los Angeles, San 
                                 Francisco, and Las Vegas markets); 2007-2009 (San Francisco and Washington, D.C. markets); 
                                 2010 (Miami market); and 2011 (New York            market). The company entered into a 
                                 recapitalization transaction with BGCP  a private  equity sponsor  in 2005, and having exited 
                                 from private equity ownership in 2010, offered shares to the public in an IPO on July 27, 2011. 
                                 Today, the company is well positioned to cont inue to gain share in an extremely fragmented 
                                 market through its superior technology, strong balance sheet, broad geographic presence, and 
                                 superior salesforce.  

                                 State of the art technology consists of:  

                                     1)  A centralized ERP system (Oracle) for purchasing and financials. 

                                     2)  A centralized, proprietary AS400 order-entry system for sales. 

                                     3)  A new warehouse management system (BFC Dakota system), which was recently 
                                         implemented at its New York facility. Highlights of the system include voice-pick 
                                         technology, inbound scanning, and pallet and truck-building software. Chefs' 
                                         Warehouse is currently implementing the system at its Washington D.C. facility, and 
                                         management expects a company-wide rollout by 1Q12. 

                                     4)  Roadnet logistics, a routing application used to dynamically route all trucks. 

                                     5)  Geotab, an onboard GPS and truck diagnostic tool that assesses the vehicles health and 
                                         idle time, and the general performance of the drivers.  

                                 Geographic footprint provides competitive advantage.      With a presence in New York, Los 
                                 Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, Chefs Warehouse is the    
                                 only specialty foodservice distributor with a presence in multiple geographies and we believe 
                                 this provides the company with a competitive advantage with better service levels, order 
                                 accuracy, and more efficient routing, resulting in reduced inbound and outbound freight costs.  

                                 Chefs' Warehouse is uniquely positioned to serve the early adopters of culinary trends  .      
                                 As a distributor to cutting edge and fine-dining restaurants in the countrys leading culinary 
                                 markets, Chefs' Warehouse is focused on sourcing unique, specialty products before they 
                                 become mainstream culinary ingredients. As a result, the company has an unparalleled breadth 
                                 and depth of specialty product offerings (e.g., Chefs' Warehouse offers more than 125 varieties 
                                 of olive oil vs. a typical broadline distributor carrying only 5-10 different types of olive oil). 
                                 The companys portfolio includes ~11,500 SKUs  available to order, and 7,000 SKUs that are 
                                 in-stock every day  a significantly broader offering than many of the smaller, private specialty 
                                 distributors. The SKU offering will likely expand once the company moves into its new facility

                                                                                                                              420

BMO Capital Markets                                                                                       Chefs' Warehouse 
                                  
                                 in the Bronx. New opportunities for SKU expansion include cut proteins, produce, and an 
                                 expanded frozen offering.  

                                 National presence and breadth of SKUs means Chefs Warehouse is a critical route-to-
                                 market for specialty suppliers .  Chefs' Warehouse sources product from more than 1,000 
                                 different suppliers, none of which accounts for more than 5% of Chefs' Warehouses total 
                                 purchases in a year. In some cases, Chefs' Wa  rehouse provides a critical route-to-market for 
                                 some of the smaller suppliers, and as a result,  we believe Chefs' Warehouse is well positioned 
                                 to obtain favorable terms with these suppliers. In some instances, Chefs' Warehouse is also able 
                                 to lock-up exclusivity on some items from Italy, Spain, France and other Mediterranean 
                                 countries  although Chefs' Warehouse generally remains committed to meeting the needs of 
                                 the customer  so exclusivity arrangements would be arranged only if there were demand from 
                                 the end-use customer.  

                                 The salesforce at Chefs' Warehouse (130-plus personnel) distinguishes itself from its 
                                 competitors through its knowledge base and quality of service.         The majority of sales 
                                 professionals have some sort of a culinary background, either formal culinary training, degrees 
                                 in culinary arts, or prior experience in the industry. In general, each salesperson is responsible 
                                 for 50 customers, to maintain high levels of cu stomer service, as evid enced in Exhibit 7 (page 
                                 5) comparing revenue per salesperson at Sysco, United Natural Foods, and Chefs Warehouse. 
                                 Salespeople are compensated on both commission and gross profit dollars.  

                                 Financial Forecasts 

                                 In 3Q11, we are looking for EPS of $0.19 and EBITDA of $7.5 million.    Our estimate assumes 
                                 total sales increase 13.5% to $96.4 million, with gross margins declining 75bp to 25.2%. We 
                                 forecast operating expenses (exclu ding D&A) grow 9.1% to $16.8 million, a 70 bp year-over-
                                 year improvement in margin  leading to a 20 bp deterioration in operating margins to 7.2%, or 
                                 $6.9 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $7.5 million, a 5 bp deterioration in margin to 7.8%. 
                                 We assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 39.5% tax rate, and 21.1 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.19.  

                                 In FY2011, our estimates for EPS and EBITDA are $0.77 and $29.7 million, respectively. 
                                 Our estimate assumes total sales increase 18.3% to $390.7 million, with gross margins 
                                 improving 2 bp to 26.0%. We forecast operatin  g expenses (excluding  D&A) grow 15.9% to 
                                 $72.0 million, a 39 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 49 bp improvement 
                                 in operating margins to 7.0%, or $27.4 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $29.7 million, a 42 
                                 bp improvement in margin to 7.6%. We assume interest expense of $1.2 million, a 39.1% tax 
                                 rate and 20.9 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.77.  

                                 In FY2012, we are looking for EPS of $0.99 and EBITDA of $37.7 million.         Our estimate 
                                 assumes total sales increase 12.5% to $431.2 million, with gross margins expanding 30 bp to 
                                 26.3%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 5.3% to $75.8 million, an 85 bp

                                 improvement in margin, to 8.7%. We assume interest expense of $0.9 million, a 39.5% tax rate 
                                 and 21.0 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.99.  

                                 Chefs' Warehouse reported a 2Q11 EPS of $0.17, or $0.20 when using pro forma interest 
                                 expense and a normalized tax rate. Adjusted        EBITDA came in at $7.6 million.       Our 
                                 EBITDA subtracts expenses associated with pu blic company costs, and stock compensation, 
                                 and excludes the benefit of the workers co  mpensation settlement  and customs duty refund.  
                                 Total sales increased 18.7% to $99.3 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.0% to the top line and 
                                 inflation/mix contributed 3.3%, and the remaining growth was organic. Gross margins 
                                 increased 21 bp to 26.5%. Operating expenses  (excluding D&A) grew 19.3% to $18.7 million 
                                 after excluding incremental public company costs ($0.3 million), one-time stock compensation 
                                 costs ($0.12 million), one-time workers compensation trust settlement costs ($0.13 million), and 
                                 a one-time benefit from a customs duty refund ($ 0.2 million). Operating margins increased 31 
                                 bp to 7.3%. Interest expense came in at $3.3 million, but does not reflect the post-IPO capital 
                                 structure, so we used a pro forma interest expense of $0.4 million. We used a normalized tax 
                                 rate of 39.6%, which gets us to EPS of $0.20.
