                                                          not play out at all). 2) While unlikely, ACTV could lose large contracts material

      Summary and Investment Conclusion 

      Active Network (ACTV) is a company that shows many of the attributes of successful Internet companies that we like to see, 
      including: 1) a unique business model that is difficult to replicate or compete against; 2) a unique relationship with its customers (both 
      organizations and participants); and 3) strong recurring revenue and visibility. 

      ACTV’s business model is simple: the company automates the labor-intensive process of registering participants for different kinds of 
      events. Organizations from triathlons to soccer camps to campgrounds to church groups all use Active Network’s software and 
      websites to register participants online for their respective events. ACTV’s solutions are mission-critical for many of these 
      organizations, which historically (and in many cases currently) had to manage the registration process manually offline. Active 
      Network not only processes the registration transaction, but also provides lots of analytics, tracking, optimization and demand 
      generation tools to its customers in an effort to increase the event organizer’s revenue and decrease costs. For these services and 
      solutions, ACTV charges its customers around 6.5% of each registration fee, which aligns the customer’s incentive of increasing the 
      size (and revenue generation) of the event, with Active Network’s goal of increasing its revenue. 

      Looking across the landscape of online advertising, online travel and e-commerce sectors that we cover, we find few companies that 
      enjoy Active Network’s dominant position in its space and below-average level of large-scale competition. The company’s 2010-
      2012E 15% revenue CAGR may fall short of some of the faster-growing, newer business models emerging in the space, but few 
      others have the same entrenched position in their respective industry. As a result, shareholders are likely to realize value over time as 
      the company continues on its stable growth trajectory but begins to pull some of the cost/efficiency levers. Our expectation for a 
      highly predictable, 15% revenue CAGR with expanding margins is likely to warrant a premium valuation over time.

   Investment Thesis 
   Our bullish thesis on Active Network is based on the following six factors: 1) the company has the highest level of revenue visibility 
   in our coverage universe; 2) we expect EBITDA margins to expand significantly through 2015; 3) ACTV operates in a large 
   addressable market with low online penetration; 4) revenue and margins will naturally benefit from a shift to online; 5) there is 
   minimal competition that poses any real threat to Active Network’s position; and 6) ACTV’s proven management team has 
   demonstrated its ability to execute and grow the business both organically and through accretive M&A. 

   Active Network Has the Highest Level of Revenue Visibility in Our Coverage Universe 
   The recurring nature of the events that Active Network supports and the long-term nature of its customer contracts (and low churn) 
   provide the company with an unusually high level of revenue visibility. Active Network can predict approximately 85% of the 
   following year’s revenue before the start of the year. The organizations that Active Network provides its services to operate events on 
   a regular schedule each year or several times per year, and ACTV can reasonably expect to run the same event the following year. 
   Active’s goal is to reduce costs and increase revenue for its clients, while increasing the mix of event participants signing up through 
   Active Network (vs. offline) and hence online.

   satisfaction) compared to other companies in the online services space.

   Active Network expe86.7%cts its adjusted EBITDA margin 85.0%to 86.4%expand by as much as 86.2%1600bp over the next several years, from the 9% level

 30%to 2012, well ahead of the peer average of 29% (defined as our coverage universe), despite revenue growth at only a 15% CAGR. We 
   project adjusted EBITDA to grow to $33.1 million in 2011 and $51.0 million in 2012, up from $25.1 million in 2010.

       target adjusted EBITDA margin of ~25%. (Note that the individual expense lines include depreciation and amortization which are 
       added back to arrive at adjusted EBITDA, and thus adding these lines together does not arrive at the total EBITDA margin shown.)

     Sales & Marketing 
     The company expects Sales & Marketing (S&M) expense as a percentage of revenue to achieve the least amount of leverage in the 
     coming years, with only around 200bps through 2013-2015 (21% to 19% of revenue). ACTV will continue to invest in S&M activities 
     to increase its breadth of organizations and events under management. S&M expense is largely comprised of salary and benefits for 
     sales and marketing employees, but also includes other promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing. 
     As the sales staff matures and becomes more productive, we estimate the company should see modest operating leverage.

     Active Network expects to achieve leverage of ~500bp-600bp from Research & Development (R&D) from 2010 to 2013-2015, going 
     from 22% of revenue in 2010 to ~16.5% in three to five years. R&D costs support the technology platforms used and thus reflect both 
     in-house platforms that will be used going forward (the “Base” platforms), as well as those added in corporate acquisitions and older

     systems being retired (the “End of Life”, or “EOL”, platforms). The company is building a unified single platform for all of its various 
     customers and verticals to operate on top of. This project is one of the largest initiatives at ACTV2010Target over the next several years and

     should bring about efficiencies and greater speed and flexibility to roll out new features and services to its clients. In the interim, the 
     older and acquired systems must be maintained and kept reasonably up to date until customers operating through those platforms can 
     be ported over to the new Active Network software stack, a process that is likely to take several years.

     Leverage from R&D will come from both economies of scale on the Base platform as well as the tapering off of expenses related to 
     the maintenance of EOL systems.  

     General & Administrative 
     The company expects to gain between 300bp and 400bp of leverage over the next four to five years in General & Administrative 
     (G&A) expense as a percent of revenue, going from a reported 13.6% of revenue in 2010 to a target of ~10%. G&A expense is largely 
     comprised of salary and benefits for employees in support roles, such as finance, legal, and public company costs, but also includes 
    $100professional fees as well as software and travel expenses for support employees. Similar to most companies in our coverage universe, 30%

      Large TAM with Below-Average Online Penetration 

      $10 Billion Total Marketplace for Event Registrations  
      The event registrations marketplace is primarily one that has the vast majority (97%) processed offline. According to Active Network, 
      in 2010, over 800,000 organizations hosted recreational or communal events that required over 1.7 billion event participants in North 
      America to complete a registration form, with total participation or “activity” fees collected around these events summing to 
      approximately $109 billion. The typical registration processing fee (or “take rate”) is around ~6.5% of total activity fees, often with 
      additional fees for registration and application. In total, this translated to the total addressable market (TAM) opportunity in the North 
      American event registration space to more than $10 billion in 2010.

      Only 3% of Total Registrations Processed Online 
      According to Active Network, in 2010, only ~3% of the 1.7 billion event registrations completed were processed online, or 
      approximately 51 million registrations. By comparison, Active Network completed around 40% of its registrations online in 2010, 
      with 28.3 million online registrations, or on the order of 55% of the total market’s online registrations (assuming 51 million total 
      online registrations). As more registrations move online at ACTV’s organization customers, the company could see modest 
      acceleration in growth, as it tends to pick up a disproportionate share given its wide reach in the space.

In 2010 Active Network processed ~70 million registrations in total, which represented ~4% of total event registrations. The 70 
million total registrations handled by Active Network represents ~4% of registrations in North America, and the 28 million online 
registrations represent only 2% of the total North American market. Active Network managed registrations for 47,000 organizations, 
representing ~6% of the 800,000 North American organizations that hosted an event (although we don’t like to focus on total number 
of organizations because size of organization can significantly skew the data).  

Core Registration Segments 
Active’s addressable market consists of four broad organization categories (today): business, community, sports, and outdoors. Of the 
over 800,000 organizations that hosted an event in 2010, the vast majority, ~500,000, were community organizations, followed by 
sports (225,000+), business (100,000+) and outdoors (12,000+). We note that a particular organization may have any number of 
events and even more volume of registrations per year, so the use of organizations as a growth or market penetration metric can be 
somewhat misleading (and hence, we present these statistics here only to give a sense of the marketplace and clientele for Active 
Network). Individual registration volume estimates are also not available on a category level so it is difficult to identify an accurate 
market share for ACTV across the four major segments.  

Sports: Organizations in the sports segment include endurance events (Active Network’s first core services area), sport organizers, 
leagues, tournaments, sports camps, and golf courses. In 2010, there was a TAM of over 225,000 sport organizations, leagues and 
tournaments as well as 16,000 golf courses that relied on event registrations. Active Network currently manages registrations for over 
1,500 public golf courses (e.g., BethPage Golf Club, Hilton Golf), 10,000+ endurance event customers (e.g., the Ironman Triathlon), 
and 25,500+ leagues and clubs (e.g., United States Tennis Association), so the sports segment still only addresses a fraction of the 
total addressable market, even though Active Network has provided services to this vertical longer than any of the others. 

Outdoors: Outdoor organizations include campground sites and state hunting & fishing departments. In North America alone, the 
TAM for these organizations is over 12,000 campground sites as well as hunting & fishing departments for all 50 states. By the end of 
2010, 34 states were managing their campgrounds (4,000+ parks and 3,000+ campgrounds) and 23 states were managing their hunting 
and fishing licenses via Active software, websites and call centers. Reserve America, ACTV’s campground reservation service, 
acquired from IAC in 2009 for $50 million, falls into the Outdoors vertical. 

Community: This customer segment includes educational, non-recreational government and faith-based organizations as well as 
camps and park and recreation agencies. In 2010, Active Network had over 1,500+ parks departments and community recreational 
centers, 3,500+ educational organizations, 1,600+ summer camps and over 100+ city and country governments. That year, the TAM in 
North America consisted of over 90,000 educational and 55,000 non-recreational government organizations, 270,000 religious groups, 
50,000 camps and 9,000 parks and recreation agencies. 

Business: The business segment includes all corporations that are using third-party registration services to manage conferences, 
speaker series, fundraisers and other corporate events. In 2010 over 100,000 corporate and business organizations hosted events that 
required some form of event registration. ACTV has over 8,000 corporate clients including Subway, Cisco, Microsoft and Hewlett-
Packard, among others. 

The Endurance Vertical – A Proxy for What the Rest of the Segments Could Evolve To 
Active Network holds a significantly higher percentage of the total available organizations and registrations in the endurance sports 
(i.e., triathlon and marathon) category. At its inception, Active Network wanted to solve the problem of participants signing up for 
important endurance sports events, which previously were handled mostly offline, by mail/check, which were very problematic for 
both organizations and participants. Event organizers realized significant revenue generation, cost savings, and troubleshooting 
benefits once they adopted Active Network’s online registration platform. As more and more endurance events shifted their event 
registration and event promotions to Active Network, the company’s market share in the category increased. 

ACTV has been in the endurance space for 13 years and has managed to win over 70% market share of organizations in the category. 
More importantly, as event organizers use Active Network, they are seeing higher revenue generation and lower costs of registration 
over time, the real value proposition of working with Active. The company’s role in the endurance category has allowed 45% of 
overall registrations to now take place via ACTV, well above the company’s overall industry penetration of 4% (discussed below). 
ACTV’s goal is to replicate the success it has experienced in the endurance category across each of its other verticals: winning more 
and more events and organizations, and shifting more registrations from offline to the more efficient online process, which is the key 
driver of the long-term growth thesis.

      In 2010, there were over 1.7 billion event registrations, of which 70 million, or 4%, were completed through Active Network. 
      However, of the 1.1 million endurance sports registrations in the U.S. in 2010, ~500,000, or 45%, registered for their event through 
      Active Network. 

      Mix Shift to Online Drives Revenue and Margin 
      Active’s registration business model is simple: the company earns an average of 6.5% plus additional fees for each registration that it 
      processes (the take rate discussed below). The revenue growth at the company is driven by growing the volume of registrations 
      managed by ACTV and increasing the revenue per registration. Volume growth is dictated by share shift from offline to online and 
      increased market share for ACTV. Revenue per registration is mostly a function of mix of registrations. 

      There are two scenarios under which mix shift will drive additional registration revenue: 1) a higher take rate on hunting and fishing 
      licenses purchased directly from Active NetworkNorth America Market versus via other means (offline and off ACTV)Triathlons; and 2) additional registrations 
      captured by ACTV at events where some 1.7B Participantsoffline cash transactions are currently not done through the Active Network system. Beyond 1.1M Participants 
      the revenue boost, a shift to online registrations will also cut down on costs from the more labor-intensive call centers, increasing 
      margins. In 2010, Active Network processed 28.3 million registrations online, an increase of 20.8% vs. 2009. We estimate that the 
      number of online registrations will increase 16% in 2011 and 14% in 2012, bringing the number of online registrations processed by 
      ACTV in 2012 to 37.5 million. As online registration growth continues to outpace offline registration growth, we estimate that online 
      registrations as a percentage of total registrations will increase from 35.8% in 2009 to 44.9% in 2012, or roughly 230bp of share shift 
      per annum.                                               ACTV                             Other TAM

      Licenses Booked Online Earn Higher Take Rate 
      Hunting and fishing licenses booked offline tend to earn a lower take rate for Active Network due to the revenue share paid out to the 
      offline merchant. Offline registrations for licenses are typically done through retailers at a physical location, like a bait & tackle shop 
      or a Walmart. The registrant will request the license at the cashier who enters the information into a point of sale (POS) machine and 
      provides the license. As the retailer is performing a service, Active Network shares the revenue earned from the registration. Under the 
      current economics, a hunting or fishing license booked at a physical retailer earns Active Network net revenue of around ~$0.90, 
      while a license booked online earns the company ~$3, more than three times as much. A shift to online offers a clear benefit in a 
      higher take rate for Active Network.

      retailer’s primary objective. 

      Additional Volume as Out-of-System Registrations Move Online 
      Events often offer day-of registrations that are performed in cash and are not captured in the ACTV system. While Active Network 
      may have been contracted to handle all of the registrations for the event, both on- and offline, the company has no control over these 
      transactions, and will not be paid for the registration. In this scenario, a greater mix of online registrations simply results in a greater 
      volume of registrations being completed through the Active Network system, driving higher revenue growth despite the take rate 
      being equivalent between on- and offline. 

      Online Registrations Cost Less per Unit than Offline Registrations for Active 
      As more registrations move online, ACTV will be able to realize higher margins, as noted in the “EBITDA Margins to Expand 
      Significantly” section above. Once the initial investment has been made on the registration technology platform, online registrations 
      have a natural lower-cost higher-efficiency over similar offline registrations, which have a higher variable labor component. Online 
      registrations are often fully automated, so an incremental transaction does not have any associated cost (outside of minimal cost 
      allocation for web hosting and maintenance) and is much less prone to human error. On the other hand, offline registrations are 
      performed through one of Active Network’s call centers, which have a direct labor component associated in the call technician taking 
      and processing the registration. In the case of some outdoor activity registrations, such as campground management, the ASP is so low 
      that the variable cost to Active Network balances out any gain in revenue, resulting in effectively a breakeven registration.  

      Minimal Competition Online 
      The market for online event registrations is very fragmented. As discussed below, there are a number of organizations across a wide 
      range of categories that require software solutions to handle their registrations. Active Network is the leading provider of these 
      registration solutions by a significant margin in this fragmented space, at over six times the registration revenue and volume of its 
      closest competitor.  

      ACTV has acquired a number of large and small competitors over the years in an attempt to diversify the categories that it operates in, 
      and the organizations that it depends on. Across all of these verticals, there are common requirements from event customers: they need 
      a solution that reduces cost, allows for tracking and management of their events, allows for marketing and promotion, and has certain 
      compliance requirements. As a result, few service providers have the scale necessary to compete with Active Network on price and 
      service quality. 

      The majority of online event registration competition comes from small niche competitors, which have legacy relationships with a few 
      organizations in their immediate region. A few examples include Eventrite, an event-based management and e-commerce company 
      that targets small communities events; Meetup Inc., a social network that assists group meeting organization; MyPunchBowl, a party 
      planning and management service; and Amiando, a global SaaS provider that assists with event marketing, registration and payment

processing. Many of the smaller competitors are below ACTV’s radar, although as an example of one that could present a competitive 
threat, we briefly describe Cvent below. 

Cvent 
Cvent is an event, survey and e-marketing solutions company that employs over 800 personnel worldwide. According to company 
reports, to date, Cvent is used by over 90,000 professionals, and since its inception, it has managed over 275,000 events and surveys. 
Cvent offers customers a variety of online services including event management, supplier networking, meeting management and web 
surveying. Cvent solutions compete primarily with Active Network’s corporate segment, but Cvent competes in the non-profit, 
government and educational space as well.  

Cvent’s primary solutions are: 

Event Management: A proprietary event management software that enables customers to manage registration, marketing, budgeting, 
analytics and other aspects of events online. 

Supplier Network Services (SNS): SNS is an online database that matches event space suppliers with organizations that are looking 
for large venues to host upcoming events. 

Meeting Management: Meeting Management solutions help organizations plan, manage and source their meetings while also 
providing analytical tools to help corporations identify and evaluate a meeting’s effectiveness and ROI.  

High Quality Management Team 
One of Active Network’s biggest intangible assets is its culture. The company has many endurance sports athletes across many parts 
of the organization. This athletic culture has created a very driven and aggressive “get things done” attitude that most ACTV 
employees embrace. 

Active Network has assembled a top management team, many of which have been with the company for over ten years, which 
embodies several qualities we see as key to the company’s success. In addition to solid organic growth, a significant portion of 
ACTV’s growth has come through acquisitions of competing and complementary companies, a strong internal culture is extremely 
important to ensure a successful integration; we believe that culture is driven from the top by the strong management team.  

Risks to Monitor 
As mentioned above, Active Network’s model is unique in that it does not have as much risk from competition as other online 
businesses we cover across e-commerce, online advertising and online travel. Active Network typically competes against smaller 
regional companies that have relationships with organizations, but can rarely compete on resource allocation, breadth of services 
provided, or in some cases, price. There are also some “free-mium” registration solutions that are available to organizations today and 
should increasingly become available as software applications shift from a client-server architecture, to a more collaborative cloud 
architecture over the next several years. We don’t expect ACTV to lose share to these companies, but in some cases, smaller 
organizations could choose to in-house their registration process. 

Outside of the risk from competition, we see three primary risks to our investment thesis: 1) our adjusted EBITDA growth estimates of 
32% and 54% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, are contingent upon ACTV achieving operational leverage; therefore, there is a risk that 
any delay or failure to deliver on margin expansion plans could cause EBITDA to fall short of future estimates; 2) a loss of a large 
customer(s) could lead to a considerable reduction in registrations; and 3) integration risks associated with future M&A. 

Margin Expansion from Platform Upgrade Might Not Deliver on Time or Meet Expectations 
Our 2011 and 2012 adjusted EBITDA estimates imply year-on-year growth rates of 32% and 54%, respectively, compared to year-on-
year revenue growth of 15% in both years. As EBITDA growth outpaces revenue growth, we project ACTV’s adjusted EBITDA 
margin will expand from 9.0% in 2010 to 13.8% in 2012. Although management expects long-term revenue growth to remain ~15%, 
ACTV believes that its adjusted EBITDA margin could expand to ~25% by 2015. Every 10bp reduction in our implied adjusted 
EBITDA margin for 2011 and 2012 would reduce our 2011 and 2012 EBITDA estimates by approximately 1%. 

As noted earlier, to achieve the 25% EBITDA margin target, Active Network believes it can gain: 1) 500-600bp of leverage from cost 
of revenue from technological fixed cost efficiencies; 2) S&M leverage of ~200bp from revenue growth outpacing headcount 
increases; 3) 500-600bp of leverage from R&D as support costs for acquired platforms are reduced over time; and 4) 300-400bp of 
leverage from G&A from efficiencies in infrastructure and from revenue growth outpacing headcount increases.  

Cost of revenue leverage should come largely from efficiencies in fixed costs (call center expenses) as registration mix shifts to 
online; however, it could happen that users fail to use online for registration or the shift to online happens much slower than expected, 
which would result in a delay or elimination of cost of revenue leverage. Like most other online categories, we expect (and have 
witnessed to date) a natural shift in registration volume from offline to online. Mobile registrations should help shift from offline to 
online. 

                                                                                                                                11

                                                                                                                                  262

July 5, 2011                                                                                              Active Network, Inc.

S&M and G&A leverage both come from an anticipated growth in revenue above headcount growth, as employees in the two groups 
are able to achieve scale efficiencies and become more productive. The sales staff becomes more efficient as it matures, and the 
members of G&A are able to make better use of time and serve more employees as a growing department allows for greater 
specialization of roles. In S&M, the risk that target margins are not achieved is mitigated by the fact that if the company needs to slow 
hiring in that department, employee mix will shift to more experienced, more productive members, supporting margins. The additional 
leverage in G&A from infrastructure and scale efficiencies will come eventually, even if revenue growth is slower than anticipated; 
the infrastructure investment has already been made, so the company will benefit from scale, even if it is delayed.  

The greatest risk to achieving target leverage in R&D is delays in the single-platform initiative, which allows for end-of-lifeing some 
of the legacy software platforms from acquired companies. Additional M&A activity could also introduce more EOL technology 
expense which would compress margins. 

Loss of Large Contracts  
The majority of ACTV’s revenues are generated from customers that have entered into long-term contracts, with the standard contract 
length ranging from three to seven years. However, Active Network has multiple customers that operate under contracts that have 
terms of service less than three years, some of which actually renew on a yearly basis. If these customers decide not to renew with 
ACTV, which may not necessarily be a reflection on the Active service offering but rather due to the client’s financial situation 
(especially in the case of state and municipal government contracts), ACTV could report financial results below expectations. 

As of early 2011, Active Network operated registration services for fishing and hunting licenses in 23 states and provided reservation 
and management services for campgrounds in 32 states. In addition, ACTV works with many community organizations that fall under 
the jurisdiction of local and state agencies. These contracts are subject to an open bidding process and must be renewed every two 
years. A failure to re-win these contracts would negatively affect financial performance.  

While the potential loss of customer contracts will always remain a risk for ACTV, we believe that the loss of multiple large 
organization contracts is unlikely. The typical ROI for an Active Network customer is 381%, so there is significant incentive for 
clients to remain with the company. ACTV’s solutions help organizations increase their participants per event while simultaneously 
reducing costs, giving organizations increased dependency on ACTV and little reason to consider not renewing. An internal analysis 
conducted by ACTV in 2010, in which it analyzed 75% of its registration revenue, found that its registration churn in terms of revenue 
dollars was less than 5%. 

Complications from M&A Integration  
Active Network is a roll-up of several services providers across the four vertical categories mentioned previously. M&A has been 
ACTV’s primary method for entering new markets and sub-verticals. The company has completed 27 acquisitions since its inception. 
Increased M&A activity poses two potential risks for ACTV: 1) acquisitions could delay the margin expansion target time-line, which 
could cause reported EBITDA figures to be below market estimates; and 2) with any M&A, integration risk is always a concern.

   Company Overview 
   Active Network provides event registration software and services to community, sports, business and outdoor organizations. In 
   addition to registration processing, Active Network’s technology platform provides organizations with various marketing, operating 
   and analytics tools which help their clients’ event management end-to-end by increasing event participation and reducing overall event 
   costs. 

   The Business Model  
   The company operates under two primary revenue lines: technology and marketing. Technology revenue consists of two areas:  
   1) Registration revenue: earned through the completion of registrations where ACTV earns a ~6.5% take rate on each registration fee; 
   and 2) Software License revenue: via Active licensing software to certain organizations on a flat monthly fee. Marketing revenue 
   includes several items, such as online advertising, marketing done at client events, and commerce revenue from ancillary items sold 
   through Active Network’s site.

   The majority of company revenues consist of Registration revenue, which represented 71% of total company revenue in 2010; 
   Software revenue represented 14% of total revenue; and Marketing made up the remaining 15%. We project Registration revenue to 
   grow at 14% and 15% over each of the next two years, respectively, maintaining its approximate share of total revenue at 70% of total 
400in 2012E. Software revenue is projected to outpace the other two lines in 2011, at 30% y/y growth, before decelerating to 15% in 
   2012E; marketing is projected to grow at only 4% in 2011, against a tougher comp, before reaccelerating to 17% in 2012E.

       In 2010, Registration revenues of $197.6 million were approximately 83% of technology revenues and 70% of total revenues, in line 
       with 2009 levels. We project Registration revenues to grow 14.4% in 2011 and 14.7% in 2012, to $259 million. Registration revenues 
       will be driven by both the number of registrations completed through Active Network’s technology, as well as from an increase in 
       average revenue per registration. Registration volume growth is driven by: 1) Active winning more customers; 2) existing customers 
       shift more of their events to Active; and 3) Active processing more registrations from existing clients for the same events (typically as 
       event registrations shift from offline/in person to online via Active’s software).

     In 2010, ACTV’s revenue per registration was $2.82, a 5.9% increase from 2009, as shown in Exhibit 18; we expect revenue per 
     registration to continue to grow in 2011 and 2012. We estimate that revenue per registration will increase 6.4% and 3.6% in 2011 and 
     2012, respectively, implying revenue per registration of $3.10 in 2012. It should be noted that Active Network has not increased its prices 
     in three years, and our projections do not incorporate any price increase on the average ~6.5% take rate (excluding additional fees) 
     through 2012.

     performing a service, ACTV must pay a revenue share, which drives take rate down from the ~$3 per registration earned online to 
     around $0.90 per license. Active Network currently processes more than 30 million hunting and fishing licenses per year, with only 
     9% of those booked online. As more of these users begin to register online, the significantly higher take rate will drive a higher 
     revenue per registration.

     While we expect the average revenue per registration will grow in the low-to-mid single digits over the next few years, Exhibit 19 
     highlights the seasonality of registration revenues. In 1Q11 ACTV reported revenue per registration of $3.69, well ahead of our full-
     year 2011 estimate of $3.00, and we estimate that revenue per registration will decline to $3.05, $2.72, and $2.70 in 2Q11, 3Q11, and 
     4Q11, respectively.  

     The sequential declines in revenue per registration are the result of mix shift, as fishing and hunting licenses and campground 
     registration revenues are closer to ~$1 per license/registration, and these activities make up the smallest percentage of total 
$4.00
     registrations in 1Q. Hunting and fishing$3.69 and campground registrations as a percentage of total registrations increase throughout the 

$3.50year during the peak outdoor seasons. However, the seasonal affect of revenue per registration will become less extreme over time as 
     growth in other segments should outpace growth in these lower revenue per registrati$3.05on verticals.

     The second component of technology revenue comes from the licensing of ACTV software to organizations. In 2010, software 
     revenues accounted for 17% of Fishing & technology revenues and 14% of total revenues. Under the licensing model, customers pay a

  In 2010, Software revenues were $40.1 million, up 10% from 2009; we expect further growth in revenue of 30% in 2011 and 16% in 
  2012 to reach revenue of $60 million. We expect software revenue as a percentage of total revenue to remain at ~15% over the next 
  few years, in line with historical averages.  

  Marketing Revenue 
  Active Network generates approximately 15% of its revenues from marketing-related services, which consist of revenues earned 
  through three primary sub-segments: online marketing, field marketing, and commerce. Online marketing services include 
  banner/display ads that appear on Active.com sites, button ads and newsletter and email marketing. Field marketing services include a 
  wide range of event promotions and sponsorship which can take place at the customer’s event or elsewhere. Commerce revenues 

$70include membership programs, training programs, websites, and other purchases made 35%through Active.com websites.  
                                                                       $60.4

  4.4% in 2011 and 17% in 2012, bringing 2012 marketing revenues to $51.2 million$40.1. The 29% year-over-year increase in 2010 was the

  out specifically by the company on an ongoing basis. Online Services accounted for approximately 45% of total marketing revenues, 
  or $19 million. Commerce revenues and Field Marketing revenues of $17.2 million and $5.7 million represented 41% and 14% of 
  marketing revenues, respectively. The company does not expect the percentage that each segment represents of total marketing 
  revenues to fluctuate meaningfully over the next few years.

   Active Network increases its revenue via three primary forms of customer acquisition: 1) winning new customers; 2) winning events 
   at existing customers (that were previously not managed by ACTV); and 3) gaining share of registrations within existing events from 
   offline (not via Active Network) to online (via Active Network’s software).  

   Active Network’s core value proposition to clients includes: 1) driving demand (and hence revenue to the event) – ACTV is able to 
   bring new participants to its various clients’ events through marketing activities across the Active participant network (people who 
   have previously registered with ACTV); and 2) reducing cost of managing registrations via automation and services mentioned above.  

   How ACTV Acquires Customers – Organizations 
   The Active Network sales force is broken down into four primary roles: 1) enterprise account executives; 2) inside account executives; 
   3) self-service reps; and 4) account managers. Individuals are organized by customer group (e.g., sports, outdoors, etc.) and deployed 
   by geography. Collectively, the sales force is responsible for driving organization growth (i.e., new client wins and new event wins 
   within existing clients), whereas participation growth is driven by various marketing channels, as discussed below. 

                                                                                                                                     23

                                                                                                                                       274

      Enterprise Account Executives 
      Enterprise Account Executives focus on leveraging state, government and corporate relations to drive new account opportunities. Each 
      executive is responsible for managing a specific territory by developing relationships with senior members of organizations and 
      leveraging those relationships into long-term business partnerships. At the beginning of 2011, Active Network had 42 executives in 
      North America and eight executives in various international regions. 

      Inside Account Executive 
      Inside Account Executives are contracted to drive new business by reaching out to prospective clients via email and phone. Each 
      executive focuses on developing unique business opportunities for clients through various Active Network offerings. These executives 
      are primarily commission-based employees that focus on middle tier clients. Active Network currently has 53 inside account 
      executives stationed in North America and six international posts.  

      Account Management 
      Account Management employees focus on managing customer accounts that have been brought in by enterprise and inside account 
      executives. Account managers are responsible for retaining clients, as well as up-selling clients to additional Active services to make 
      sure that they are utilizing the Active Network products that are relevant to their events and business operations. Active Network 
      currently has 62 account managers in North America and four in international regions.  

      Self-Service Representative 
      Self-Service Representatives are responsible for increasing Active Network’s market share amongst small and regional clients. Active 
      Network currently has 24 service reps in North America but none in international regions. 

      Time to Profitability 
      There is a learning curve for any new sales rep as ACTV’s solutions are more of a consultative sale versus other online services, and 
      most represent a longer-term investment by the company before they begin to produce. The average sales representative reaches a 
      breakeven point for Active Network after approximately 18 months. This includes a typical time to ramp up on client and industry 
      knowledge of 1-4 months, and a further 8-20 months to land enough clients to achieve profitability. The average ramp time for a sales 
      person is displayed in Exhibit 31.

    Offline B2B Strategies  
    Active Network will continue to rely on in-person marketing initiatives to complement its online presence. The offline strategy is 
    essential to attracting new customers, particularly large organizations that may not be aware of the growth, efficiencies or savings that 
    can be realized through the Active Network platform. In 2011, management expects to attend 120 trade shows, over 100 event 
    technology seminars, as well as launch Activation!, a 700-person corporate user conference.  

    How ACTV Acquires Customers – Registrations/Participants  
    Active Network’s ability to increase event participation is a major selling point for organizations. ACTV customers enjoy the cost 
    savings and operational efficiencies realized through the ACTV platform, but for many customers, it is the incremental participation 
    and the accompanying revenue increases that draw them to Active Network.

             Tradeshows, 4%
    Active relies heavily on the organizations’ own sites as well as its owned and operated sites to increase the number of participants that 
    are registering for events. Approximately 60% of ACTV registrations PPC, 9%are directed from the site of the organization that is hosting the 
  Email Marketing, event, with the remaining 40% of customer registrations navigating directly to Active Network’s websites. This blended consumer 
    acquisition strategy positions ACTV to leverage the brand of the organization 6%hosting the event while also relying on its own loyal 
    participant/registrant base.  

    Social media and partner websites are two important consumer marketing channels for ACTV. Active Network’s Facebook fan page 
Webcasts, 14%has hundreds of thousands of active users that visit daily to learn about upcoming events and other real time information. Active 
    Network’s O&O sites are also fully integrated with Facebook, which enables users to share information with their friends. ACTV has 
    a significant Twitter presence, with many users relying on Twitter to help them raise money for charity as they enter races through 
    ACTV. Active Network also relies on partner sites to acquire participants, some of which can be seen below in Exhibit 33.

       Active Network partners with many sport organization sites including iHoops (above) and littleleague.org, among others. Users that 
       click on the Active Network logo are redirected to Active Network’s flagship site where they can learn about upcoming events. The 
       state of Oregon uses Active Network to manage their campground sites, so when a user clicks on a specific campground they are 
       directed to reserveamerica.com where they can book their reservation. Active Network powers shape.com and when users click to 
       register for local events they are redirected to Active.com. 

       Client Case Studies 
       Below we present three specific case studies of actual ACTV clients that have had success managing their event registrations via 
       Active’s solutions over a multi-year time period. While the first two cases demonstrate particularly strong results, Case 3 represents 
       the average Active Network client organization, and shows that even the typical customer can experience a significant benefit from the 
       relationship. 

       Case 1: Celtic Solstice Five-Miler  
       The Celtic Solstice Five-Miler is a premier five-mile race held every December in Baltimore, Maryland. The event is organized by 
       Baltimore Running, and the company has commissioned Active Network to manage registrations for the five-mile race every year 
       since 2001. Active Network helped Baltimore Running increase revenues throug2000200120022003200420052006h increased participation20072008 and reduce costs through 20092010

       The five-mile race had 123 customers in 2000, the year before Baltimore Running hired Active Network to take over event 
       management responsibilities. Since hiring Active Network in 2001, participation has increased to 2,999 runners, growing at a CAGR 
       of 37.6% from 2000-2010. Additionally, total Celtic Solstice revenues increased from $3,075 to $146,951, a CAGR of 47.2%.

       Baltimore Running started realizing financial benefits within the first year of hiring Active Network; these benefits are shown in 
       Exhibit 35. The Company experienced cost reductions related to wages and supplies of $156, and Active Network added 115 
       participants, which accounted for 42% of all runners in 2001, with increased revenues of $2,875. (Active Network defines added 
       participants as participants that register for a given event through the Active Network platform.) Total costs paid to Active Network 
       were $311, implying a return on investment of 975% for Baltimore Running. In addition, the majority of the costs paid to Active 
       Network by Baltimore Running were passed onto event participants.

      Active Network reduced 2010 race operating expenses by $578, driven by wage and supply reductions. Through marketing and 
      various race promotions, Active Network increased total registrations by 1906 participants. The majority of participants, 1761, learned 
      about the race as they navigated through the Active Network site, while 94 registered after receiving a newsletter and 49 found out 
      about the race through Active Network’s social networking initiatives. The increase in runner participation increased Baltimore 
      Running’s race revenues by $92,050, while costs paid to Active Network were only $13,008. Based on the fee paid to Active 
      Network, the associated cost reductions and revenue increases imply an ROI of 712%.  

      Active Network Contribution  
      Active Network eliminates event registration friction, which helps drive growth in total participants and revenues. The company fully 
      integrates itself with the organization’s site, and then brings customers to the Active Network site to provide users with information

      Case 2: Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation & Tourism  
      The Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation & Tourism, similar to Baltimore Running, experienced immediate success once it 
      transferred reservation/registration management over to the Active Network event management platform, but on a much larger scale. 
      Active Network helped the Department save on administrative and accounting costs, introduced new cost-cutting initiatives, and 
      provided valuable analytics to help improve organizational efficiencies for campground reservations.

Reduced Staff / Wage CostStrategic acquisitions have been management’s primary tool with which to enter new verticals and regions. The event$515,262 registration

Search and Find through ReserveAmerica.comclients with its superior scale, technology and service offerings, it can remain a challenge to enter new verticals or to win clients away $948,812
      from current providers. Thus, Active Network has often grown through the roll-up of similar service providers, thereby gaining entry

      to a new base of customers or a previously un-penetrated market vertical.  

2010 Cost of Active NetworkMost event organizers are more focused on the operation of the event than on the functionality of their $461,099registration process. However, 
      as the registration provider will likely interact with a majority of the organization’s participants, the organizer will be very sensitive to 
      any problems in the registration process; system reliability is of the utmost importance to gain the client’s trust. Thus, once a 
      functional system is in place, organizers are generally not inclined to switch providers, unless there is a highly compelling reason to do 
      so. For this reason, acquiring the current provider might be the least expensive way to add new customers. 

      Entering a new vertical or geographical region can present an additional challenge, as Active Network may not have the reputation, 
      expertise, or track record in the target community. Here, again, acquisition may be the most efficient vehicle for entry, as it 
      immediately provides an established relationship and local expertise, which can be used to approach other, similar organizations.  

      An example of this approach is Active Network’s recently acquired Fellowship Technologies, an online church management software 
      provider that manages over 300,000 churches in North America. The acquisition immediately gave ACTV a meaningful presence in 
      the faith-based vertical, an accomplishment that could have taken significantly longer had management attempted to grow organically.  

      M&A History 
      In the past 13 years, Active Network has undergone three mergers and 27 acquisitions which have provided the company with access 
      to new customer bases across North America. 

      Mergers 
      Early in the company’s history, it underwent several mergers with complementary businesses to build out the technological capability 
      and breadth of offerings. In 1999, Active Network merged with Racegate.com, an event web portal and event management service 
      provider, to form ActiveUSA.com as the largest recreational sports portal. In 2000, Active Network merged with Sierra Digital Inc. to 
      provide online registration services to outdoor recreation enthusiasts. In 2001, the company merged with Myteam.com, a leading 
      center for online team sports marketing and community. In addition, Leagelink and ActiveUSA (an Active Network subsidiary) 
      merged in 2001.

      Large Acquisitions 

      Class Software Solutions - October 2004 
      In October 2004, Active Network acquired Class Software Solutions for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition provided technology 
      solutions and access to community service agencies that included local governments, park and recreation agencies, community 
      centers, etc. Class Software Solutions, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company, had 700 customers and $12 million in annual 
      revenue. This ACTV subsidiary has grown to generate $33 million in revenue with 1,800 customers in 2010.  

      RegOnline – January 2008 
      In January 2004, Active Network acquired RegOnline for $47 million. RegOnline is an event management software provider and the 
      largest service provider by revenues for corporate and independent organizations. RegOnline, a Colorado-based company, had a wide 
      range of recognized corporations as customers such as Hitachi, Burger King, Sony and more.  

      Outdoor Central – November 2008 
      In October 2004, Central Trust Bank’s Conservation Licensing Division and Outdoor Central and its wholly owned subsidiary 
      Outdoor Central was acquired by ACTV for an undisclosed amount. Outdoor Central processed hunting and fishing licenses for 24 
      state government agencies and after the acquisition, Active Network became the largest provider of hunting and fishing licensing 
      technology in the U.S. by the number of licenses processed. 

      Reserve America – January 2009 
      In January 2009, Active Network acquired IAC’s Reserve America segment in a 3.5 million convertible preferred stock swap deal 
      totalling $50 million. Reserve America, a campground reservation provider, managed over 300,000 campgrounds in major North 
      American National Parks. This acquisition positioned Active Network as the leading outdoor recreation technology provider by the 
      number of registrations managed.

     Challenge of M&A Integration 
     Although Active Network management has shown a knack for business combinations, the acquisition of new companies can pose a 
     significant integration challenge. On top of the cultural and operational matters that arise in a typical acquisition, Active Network 
     faces an additional challenge in the integration and assimilation of new technology platforms. As the company does not want to 
     disrupt the customer’s experience, the transition process is undertaken so as to be as seamless as possible to any user, an effort that can 
     increase the overall expense base.   

     Active Network has embarked on a very significant initiative, started in 2008, to consolidate all its acquired systems and platforms 
     onto one core singular software solution, referred to as ActiveWorks, that can be leveraged across any organization or event. When 
     Active Network acquires a company with its own proprietary registration system, end-customers on that system can often not 
     immediately be ported over to ACTV’s core platform, as each vertical has nuances and services that are unique. As a result, the 
     company must operate both the acquired and internal systems simultaneously and thus incur double the typical expense run rate for 
     software maintenance in many cases. The ActiveWorks project aims to consolidate all acquired software platforms onto a single 
     solution, thus eliminating the duplicative costs from running redundant systems in parallel.  

     Even with the ActiveWorks initiative in place, there will still be a transition period for acquired software platforms, which can be 
     quite lengthy in some cases. Some integrations will be nearly immediate, where customer information and data processing can simply 
     be migrated onto the ActiveWorks platform, whereas in other cases the acquired platform will still need to be operated independently 
     for years before ACTV is able to shut it down completely. 

     Active Network views the integration of an acquired products and systems in three stages – the enduring stage, the maintenance stage, 
     and the migration stage – during which time the acquired system is referred to as EOL (“End of Life”), as it is being phased out. 
     Associated costs are thus also referred to as EOL expenses and are recognized in R&D on the income statement. As noted, depending 
     on the level of complication associated with an acquired software product or system, it may fall into different stages of the integration 
     process – i.e., some acquisitions will immediately migrate to the ActiveWorks platform, while others might spend nearly a decade in 
     the EOL stage before all clients are transitioned to ACTV systems.

     As displayed in Exhibit 41, the company is on various stages of development of the new ActiveWorks platform, and acquired systems 
    limited integration           support for existing customers 
     are being transitioned over accordingly. I2-4 yr feature n the Enduring stage, a two- to three-year process, the products and systems continue

     companies also occurs during this phase, which can take 3-4 years. In the Maintenance stage, a two- to four-year process, Active 
     Network will only provide service and maintenance to existing customers with no further feature development. Finally, in the 
     Migration stage, a one- to two-year process, the legacy system will shut down and clients will be transferred to the main platform. As 
     there are many nuances and variables to consider, it is also possible that certain systems move from any one of the three stages to the 
     ActiveWorks completed integration.ActiveWorks

In 2010, EOL expenses were $22 million or ~8% of total revenues, compared to $30 million or ~12% of total revenues in 2009. While 
we do not model EOL expenses separately, we expect they will increase by several million in 2011 due to recent additional M&A 
activity. In 2012 and beyond, ACTV expects to see a meaningful decrease in EOL expenses, and resulting leverage is an important 
component of the margin expansion thesis. However, further acquisitions could introduce new EOL systems which must be 
maintained, thus making target margins more difficult to achieve.

International Overview 
Active Network currently processes over 20 million event registrations annually across 38 countries and in 10 different currencies. As 
displayed in Exhibit 42, ACTV has 13 local dedicated websites across the world. In addition, Active Network has over 40 staff 
members across Europe and Australia as well as over 400 technology employees in China.

Exhibit 43 below displays Active Network’s homepages for Australia, France, and the U.K. The organization and the functionality of 
the three sites below, as well as all of the remaining international sites, are all comparable to Active Network’s flagship U.S. site. 
Although Active Network will adjust sites to fit local language, cultural or regional trends, the foundations of the sites are relatively 
homogenous across the world. The international opportunity for Active Network is focused on leveraging its existing relationships, 
experience and platform for use in new markets.

International Opportunity 
International expansion represents a significant growth opportunity for Active Network over the next 5-10 years. The company 
estimates that Europe’s event registration TAM is approximately US$10 billion, similar to the North American TAM. The Asian 
markets also represent a large opportunity, although it remains difficult to quantify. Combined, Active Network’s total international 
opportunity is likely more than twice that of the domestic opportunity.  

In 2005, ACTV generated less than $1 million in international revenue. By 2007, international expansion became a significant point of 
emphasis for the management team, opening the Australian office that year and expanding into the U.K. one year later with its London 
office. Since 2005, ACTV has grown international revenues by a CAGR of ~75%, and in 2010, the company grew international 
revenues 152% year-over-year. Active Network has not engaged in any meaningful international M&A; therefore, effectively all of its 
international revenue growth has been achieved organically.

  Today, the company is primarily focused on expanding its operations in the U.K., France, Germany, Australia/New Zealand and 
  Singapore. The company’s decision to focus on these five regions is in line with consumer trends in those particular countries, where 
  online, credit card, and smartphone penetration rates are similar to the U.S. and Canada, and therefore participants and organizations 
  are likely ready to handle online registration formats. Although international revenues remain small on an absolute basis, growth 
  should remain high for several years, enabling meaningful revenue contribution in the future.  

  Initial Public Offering 
  On May 25, 2011, Active Network issued 11 million shares of common stock at $15.90 per share. Of the 11 million shares offered, 8.2 
  million were primary shares and 2.8 million were secondary shares. Following the initial public offering there were approximately 53 
  million common shares outstanding, of which 27.8 million shares were held by officers, directors, and holders with positions

       Valuation & Price Target  

       We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x sales. We take an 

       average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and 

       we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.
3) Complications from M&A integration.

Conflicts Disclosures
This product constitutes a compendium report (covers six or more subject companies). As such, RBC Capital Markets chooses to
provide specific disclosures for the subject companies by reference. To access current disclosures for the subject companies, clients
should refer to https://www.rbccm.com/GLDisclosure/PublicWeb/DisclosureLookup.aspx?entityId=1 or send a request to RBC CM

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors, including total
revenues  of  the  member  companies  of  RBC  Capital  Markets  and  its  affiliates,  a  portion  of  which  are  or  have  been  generated  by
investment banking activities of the member companies of RBC Capital Markets and its affiliates.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy
RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls
RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.
