revenue growth in 2011, and a slight acceleration from +17% last quarter; 5)
2011 number of registrations grew 14% y/y to ~80M; 6) Retention rates (on a $
basis) was < 5%, which places ACTV among top tier SaaS vendors for customer
retention; 7) Software revenue grew 92% y/y in Q4, an acceleration from 49%
last quarter; and 8) Acquired Starcite to become the only SaaS based Business
Events software vendor to offer meetings management capabilities combined
with process management.
  Negatives
1) Marketing services revenue decreased 15% y/y in Q4 owing to a mix shift
in Q2/Q3; 2) PF gross margin declined 140bps sequentially to 60.7% owing to
timing of revenue recognition on larger marketing services deals; and 3) 2012
revenue guidance assumes faster growth with occur in the second half, partially
owing to deferred revenue recognition from Starcite.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 15x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our $19 price target for ACTV shares is based on the same EV/EBITDA
multiple (i.e., 15x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $60M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the out year and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is below our 20% long-
term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 1.7x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50% discount to the current
SaaS companies' group average of 4.2x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is also based on 1.9x our EV/2013E
revenue estimate of $485M, as we use a similar valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV shares should continue to
trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue mix and lower gross margins
than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.
