KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rati ng. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.
