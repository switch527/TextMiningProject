       Tangoe announced the acquisition of Profitline, for $23.5m, ~1.6x CY12 rev. This is                    11
       its 3rd acquisition this year, after acquiring HCL's TEM business and Telwares                          9
       early in 2011.  The acquisition will bri  ng ~$14m-$15m in 2012 revenues. Tangoe                        8
       expects slight accretion as customers are  migrated gradually to  its platform over                       7/11
       the next 12-18 months. With a good track record of integrating acquisitions, we                                  Tangoe, Inc.
       think this move will improve Tangoe's sc            ale, mainly with th  e addition of key                       S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)

       It appears Profitline sold out at a time  when its sizable customer base of about 50                 Stock & option liquidity data 
       was losing business competitively to Tangoe .  As has been Tangoe's practice, we                    Market cap (USDm)                                                                484.2

       US Postal Service, with about $5m in annual revenue from the government sector,                    
       where Tangoe hasn't historically had              much presence. Two other private 
       competitors of roughly the same scale as Profitline-Rivermine and Symphony - 
       now remain. Recall IBM acquired Emptor             is last week, which owns Rivermine. 
       With IBM already a top partner of Tangoe, we wouldn't be surprised to see the 
       Rivermine assets carved off, which coul d be a net positive for Tangoe, the only 
       natural consolidator in the market. 
        
       Reiterate Buy and $18 PT 
       Our $18 price target is based on a CY13               uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
       EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.1x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, 
       of 30%. Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
       profitability from new projects not ramp         ing fast enough and customers taking 
       expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

                                    Tangoe acquires Profitline 

                                    Tangoe announced the acquisition of smaller private competitor Profitline, for $23.5m, about 
                                    1.6x CY12 revenue. This is Tangoe's third consolidative move this year, after acquiring HCL's 
                                    TEM business and Telwares early in 2011. Th  e acquisition will bring about $14m-$15m in 
                                    2012 revenues and the company expects slight accretion as customers are migrated 
                                    gradually to Tangoe's platform over the next           12-18 months. With a good track record of 
                                    integrating acquisitions, we see this move as fu  rther improving Tangoe's scale, particularly 
                                    with the addition of key government agencies as customers. We reiterate our Buy rating and 
                                    $18 PT.

                                    Consolidation Opportunity Ripe and Unique to Tangoe 

                                    It appears Profitline sold out at a time when  its sizable customer base of about 50 was losing 
                                    business competitively to Tangoe. As has been  Tangoe's practice, we will likely see many of 
                                    the approximately 100 employees become integrat ed early in the process, with customers 
                                    gradually migrating to Tangoe's   platform over the next four to six quarters. Customers 
                                    include Starbucks, BASF, NASA , DoD and the US Postal Service, with about $5m in annual 
                                    revenue from the government sector, where Ta ngoe hasn't historically had much presence. 
                                    Two other private competitors of roughly the same scale as Profitline-Rivermine and 
                                    Symphony - now remain. Recall IBM acquired Em  ptoris last week, which owns Rivermine. 
                                    With IBM already a top partner of Tangoe, we   wouldn't be surprised to see the Rivermine 
                                    assets carved off, which could be a net positive  for Tangoe, the only natural consolidator in 
                                    the market.

                                              Our $18 price target is based on a CY13 uF                          CF/share estimate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G 
                                              multiple of 1.1x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 30%. Risks include 
                                              execution risk from integrating acquisitions                    , delayed profitability from new projects not 
                                              ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing in-house after early gains 
                                              from Tangoe's platform.

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
