                   We are positive on Teavanas recently announced                 Shr price, close (Apr 16, 2012)               $19.76
                   $26.9M acquisition of Teaopia. We believe Teaopia               Mkt cap, curr (mm)                             $779
                   offers a low risk path to expand Teavanas Canadian             52-Week Range                            $29.35-14.28
                   store footprint given its international aspirations. 
                   Teaopias 46 stores generate CAD $17M in revenue and 
                   management expects the acquisition to be EPS neutral 
                   (or $0.04$0.05 dilutive from transaction expenses) in 
                   2012 and accretive by $0.03$0.04 in 2013. 

                   Teaopias lower store productivity offers 
                   opportunity for revenue and EPS upside. Teaopia 
                   currently generates $435K in revenue per store vs. 
                   Teavanas average $913K per store. Teavana expects 
                   to close this revenue productivity gap over time.  

                   Teaopias similarities to Teavana should make the 
                   transition easy. Teaopia offers a similar product mix in 
                   a similar footprint (~900 sqft) and store layout (including 
                   a wall of tea). TEA expects minimal capital requirements 
                   and estimates spending ~$25K per store to rebrand 
                   them under the Teavana moniker compared to 
                   Teavanas typical $200$250K new store investment.  

                   Our analysis demonstrates the Teaopia acquisition 
                   has more EPS upside than if the company had 
                   bought back shares. We conducted an alternative 
                   use-of-cash analysis (share buyback) to benchmark the 
                   Teaopia acquisition. We found that the acquisition 
                   compares favorably with 3c4c of 2013 accretion vs. 3c 
                   for $26.9M in share buybacks. Increasing the store base 
                   by ~30% should also give Teavana additional leverage 
                   on infrastructure costs and allow the company to benefit 
                   from further scale as it makes additional system 
                   investments like CRM.                                           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                                                                                   companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                   We believe shares are currently appropriately               a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                   priced and maintain our Equal-weight. 3c-4c 2013                have a conflict of interest that could affect the

                   accretion from the acquisition at the current 22.7x P/E         should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
