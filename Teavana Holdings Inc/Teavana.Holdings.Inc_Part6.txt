                                                     Could near-term store growth be masking long-term earnings growth? Perhaps.

                                                     productivity of the TEA stores ($435 per door vs. $913 at a TEA store), which presents
                                                     a meaningful opportunity. Both, over time, should drive a higher penetration of loose
                                                     tea. We believe this could drive 25%+ earnings growth in 2H12 and 2013, even without
                                                     high single-digit comps.

VALUATION
At 24.2x 2012 P/E, 11.2x 2012 EV/EBITDA and 0.8x 2012 PEG, we believe valuation is opportunistic for a high-growth retailer.
We think the Company can accelerate earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new
store economics. Thus, we think Teavana should trade at a premium based on our $26 price target, which implies a 45.5x P/E on our
$0.57 2012 EPS estimate. Currently, the active and healthy lifestyle peer group trades at 30.8x 2012 P/E, 12.8x 2012 EV/EBITDA and
1.4x 2012 PEG. Additionally, TEA currently trades at a 2.4x 2012 EV/Sales compared to 2.2x EV/Sales for the peer group.

RISKS
Risks that could impede the stock from reaching our price target include, but are not limited to the following: ability to identify
suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior and retention of senior management.

         LOOKING FORWARD 
         Long-term earnings growth. While comp growth lost momentum, sales increased 26.8% year-over-year and store expansion 
         plans are ahead of plan (23 openings vs. 18-20 guided for 1Q12). Looking forward, the Company plans to continue its store 
         growth plans and we believe Teavana will be able to achieve +25% earnings growth in the long term.  
          
                 Store penetration of high-traffic, domestic malls. There seems to be some runway in store penetration given that 
                  approximately 50 A-mall locations will remain untouched at the end of 2012. Additionally, roughly half of the 60 planned 
                  openings in FY12 will be located in A-malls. With 23 stores opened in 1Q12, the Company expects to open 13-14 
                  stores in 2Q12. 
                 Integrating Teaopia. The Company expects the acquisition to close in 2Q12 and subsequently plans to rebrand all 
                  Teaopia stores as Teavana. In the following months, the Company will be sending Teaopia’s management teams to 
                  Atlanta, Ga. for training and hopes that this, combined with Teavana’s exclusive products and merchandising strategy, 
                  will drive Teaopia’s sales productivity closer to Teavana’s.

                 RISKS 

                 The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk, particularly on the 

                 downside. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our upside price target include but are not limited to deterioration in 

                 the consumer spending environment, slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk associated with being in 

                 a seasonal, cyclical, and trend focused sector. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our downside price target include 

                 but are not limited to a significant positive improvement in the overall economy, which would subsequently impact consumer 

                 buying behavior.     

                  

                 Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our UPSIDE price target include but are not limited to 

                 the following: ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior and retention of 

                 senior management.
