Investment Thesis 

TLLP is a fee-based, growth  oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to own, operate and 
acquire crude oil and refined products logistic s assets. In other words, TLLP was formed 
to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its l      ogistics infrastructure business. Initially, 
substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under various 
long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume commitments. 
Over the next several years, there is visible   growth from, 1) organic projects tied to its 
strategies in the Bakken shale; 2) multi year  inventories of dropdown assets from Tesoro 
Corp, and the 3) development of third party businesses.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.5 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 50% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights.

Martinez Crude Oil Terminal Dropdown 

TSO plans to dropdown Martinez Crude Oil Mari ne Terminal to TLLP in early 2012. The 
company projects the EBITDA contribution from the dropdown at about $8 million 
annually. We model the dropdown at an EBITDA   multiple of 10 times, on approximately 
$80 million. TLLP expects to finance the entire   deal with its available revolver (that is 
expandable to $300 million). We have modeled the acquisition as 50/50 debt/equity to be 
conservative, with cost of debt at 6.0% and an annual maintenance capital expenditure of 
$0.5 million. We expect the dropdown to be in the range of $0.07 - 0.11 or 4.4% - 7.4% 
accretive to cash flow, depending on the mu     ltiple of the dropdown transaction. The 
terminals projected volume is 70,000bpd with minimum volume commitments of 
65,000bpd. In addition, the terminal has a wharf capacity of 145,000bpd and storage 
capacity of 425,000 barrels.  

 

Focus on Bakken Shale 

TLLP plans to expand its High Plains system to accommodate increasing crude production 
from the Bakken Shale. Management targets to grow system volumes to over 100,000bpd 
by 2013. This is supported by expansion at TSOs Mandan refinery (+10,000 bpd) and 
Anacortes refinery (+30,000bpd).  

The Bakken Shale play is one of the premier oil plays in North America today. This 
unconventional play extends from North Dakota and eastern Montana in the United States 
into the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Bakken Shale play in 
North Dakota is currently the most actively drilled oil play in the US. According to the Land 
Rig Newsletter, the current rig count is 143 (all time high was 157 in September 2011). Oil 
production was at 463,754 bpd, up from 342,876 bpd in January 2011 and 137,642 bpd in 
January 2008, according to the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC).

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O): The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute total return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the average total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the analyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculation and a 15% and a 
7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and 7.5% thresholds 
replace the +10-15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. 
**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, 
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward.  
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months.

                          Outperform/Buy*                    48%            (61% banking clients) 
                          Neutral/Hold*                             40%            (57% banking clients)

decision to buy or sell a security should be based on investment objectives, current holdings, and other individual factors.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $33 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 
12.0%, distribution compounded annual growth rate of 8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth 
rate of 1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $33 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destruction and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

This report is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction 
where such distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Credit Suisse AG, the Swiss bank, or its subsidiaries or its affiliates 
(CS) to any registration or licensing requirement within such jurisdiction. All material presented in this report, unless specifically indicated otherwise, is under copyright to CS. None of

trademarks, service marks and logos used in this report are trademarks or service marks or registered trademarks or service marks of CS or its affiliates. 
The information, tools and material presented in this report are provided to you for information purposes only and are not to be used or considered as an offer or the solicitation of an 
offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report 
constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appropriate to your individual circumstances or otherwise 
constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or completeness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this report. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.
