 Book Value/Share                 $1.38     Teavana has a strong combination of a distinctive store environment, attractive 
                                            secular trends, and a visible gross margin tail  we initiate with a BUY rating.   The 
                                            Companys 19% operating margin is one of the highest in our coverage universe. We 
                                            believe the Company has continued margin ex pansion opportunity as the penetration of 
       EPS (Net) Summary                    loose tea increases from store maturation. Also, our proprietary field work points to a 
                                            unique performance management and compensation model; we think this helps

  First Call                          --       $0.47E    $0.61E  We establish a price target of $28, which  implies a 37.5x P/E and a 1.2x PEG based on 
   P/E 69.7x 49.6x 37.8x                    our 2012 estimates. This compares to a  30.1x 2012E P/E and 1.3x 2012E PEG for the 
                                            high growth retail peer group. 
                                             
                                            KEY INVESTMENT POINTS 
                                            The Company has a highly consultative sales force and a distinct store 
                                            environment.  Our proprietary field work points to an in-store operations model that 
                                            combines many of the best elements of our  other covered compan ies. Employees have 
                                            rigorous goal setting, and the Company has in tensive training. Sales incentives drive a 
                                            consultative environment similar to Nordstrom and Buckle. A unique store environment 
                                            that stimulates the s enses evokes lululemon athletica.  We think these attributes that 
                                            differentiate the store experience are important in the age of internet retailing.   
                                             
                                            Teavana has a leading position in the secu     larly attractive specialty tea market. 
                                            Eighty-five percent of Teavanas products are blends, which we think adds an element of 
                                            stickiness to the consumer offer. Despite the ubiquity of tea, the Company does not have 
                                            a national specialty retail com  petitor that offers high qua  lity loose tea. Our analysis 
                                            indicates that Teavana is generally the only   loose tea retailer located in its shopping 
                                            centers.  
                                             
                                            Store operating metrics are some of the strongest in our coverage and loose tea 
                                            penetration provides a gross margin tail.  The Company has roughly $1,000 in sales 
                                            PSF, one of the highest in our coverage universe. Moreover, we view its 60% gross 
                                            margin as defensible given a positive tailwind  from higher penetration of loose tea (600-
                                            800+ bps maturation mix benefit). The Co mpany continues to see strong performance 
                                            from its most recent store vintages, and we  believe that store performance from smaller 
                                            markets will remain strong.

                                    VALUATION 
                                    At 37.5x 2012E P/E, 4.0x 2012E EV/Sales and  1.2x 2012E PEG, valuation is reasonable for a 
                                    high growth retailer. The stock is up over 32% from its $17 IPO price, compared to an 8% gain in 
                                    the S&P 500 Index over the same   time period. We think the Comp any can sustain accelerating 
                                    earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive  new store opening program, strong new store 
                                    economics and multi-year runway for gross margin expansion compared to the specialty retail peer 
                                    group. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the high growth retail peer group 
                                    averages of 30.1x 2012E P/E,  3.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012E PEG. We establish a $28 
                                    price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate. We think the 
                                    multiple is fair given the Companys earnings profile and compelling unit growth opportunity.

                                                        RISKS 
                                                        Risks that could impede the shares from achieving our price target include:  
                                                         
                                                        Teavana is moving into smaller markets.  The Company has 196 stores, and a number of new 
                                                        stores will be opened in shopping malls with lower average sales per square foot than the malls in 
                                                        which the Company currently has a presence. New                                       stores will generally operate at lower gross 
                                                        margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, compared to mature stores. Our 
                                                        estimates could be at risk if the Company is unab                                   le to identify suitable locations to open new 
                                                        stores, obtain favorable lease terms, attract custom                                 ers, hire and retain personnel, and maintain 
                                                        sufficient levels of cash flow to support expansion. 
                                                         
                                                        While we see few national competitors, the tea market remains highly competitive.   The U.S. 
                                                        tea market remains highly fragmented with low barri  ers to entry. Our estimate s could be at risk if 
                                                        the Company is unable to provide a differentiated,  superior customer experience and attract more 
                                                        business than its regional and local competitors.  
                                                         
                                                        Management, particularly founder and CEO Andrew Mack, has been instrumental in the 
                                                        development of the concept; continued involvement is a key area of our investment thesis. 
                                                        Having founded the Company in 1997, CEO Andrew Mack has hired experienced senior managers 
                                                        to implement the Companys long-term growth st                                   rategy. The potential sudden departure of key 
                                                        management executives would likely impact the stock price in a significant manner, in our opinion.  
                                                         
                                                        EARNINGS OUTLOOK: 25%+ ANNUAL EPS GROWTH 
                                                        We think that Teavana will have 25% annual EPS                                         growth over the next three to five years. 
                                                        The Company has, in our opinion, one of the most                                    differentiated store environments in the mall. 
                                                        The Company has an ongoing operating margin expansion opportunity not only through the typical 
                                                        rent/occupancy leverage, but also via higher contribution from loose teas as stores mature. The 
                                                        Company has the ability to at least double the  current store base and should continue to post mid 
                                                        to high single-digit comps.

                                                       Gross margin expansion expected to continue despite three consecutive years of roughly 
                                                       200+ bps growth.  With the Company's move to direct sourcing fully anniversaried in the 3Q, we 
                                                       expect gross margin improvement from here to be driven by the natural sales mix shift away from 
                                                       merchandise toward higher margin loose tea as  new stores mature. With 54 new stores expected 
                                                       in 2011, 60 planned for 2012, 70 planned for 2013 and an estimated 80 openings per year through 
                                                       2015, we think there is a long runway for steady   gross margin expansion as new stores enter the 
                                                       comp base and ramp to maturity (a four-year time frame). New stores generally open with higher 
                                                       than average sales in the first few months; sales begin to normalize after the first three months. 
                                                       Upon opening, purchases of loose tea typically ma                                 ke up a little over 50% of sales; tea-related 
                                                       merchandise (such as teapots, cups, brewers, kettles, timers, spoons, trays) and beverages make 
                                                       up the remaining sales. As stores mature, customers graduate from buying teaware to replenishing 
                                                       their favorite teas and trying new blends  a mu                              ch more profitable sale. At maturity, loose tea 
                                                       purchases make up about  60% of sales. This evolution provid es a natural margin lift, given gross 
                                                       margins on tea sales typically run about 1,000 bps higher than non-tea product sales. With an 
                                                       accelerated store opening cadence over the next   four years, we expect the Company will see a 
                                                       sales mix shift benefit of about 600-800+ bps per cla ss of new stores over t he next decade. At the 
                                                       end of 2010, loose tea made up 56% of total sales.

                                  We also believe TEA's continued de-emphasis of beverage sales (as a percent of total sales) 
                                  has and will continue to positively impact gross margins.   Beverage sales have come down 
                                  dramatically from 8-10% of total sales in 1997  to 4% today. We believe beverage sales will likely 
                                  stay at this low single-digit percentage level go ing forward. We expect gross margins in 2011 to 
                                  reach a new peak, expanding by 165 bps year-over-year to 64.5%. Margins over the last four 
                                  quarters have grown significantly year-over-year (4Q10 +448 bps; 1Q11 +325 bps; 2Q11 +223 bps; 
                                  3Q11 +323 bps) as a result of the Company's     move to a direct sourcing model, which drove 
                                  improved product margins in non-tea merchandise ca tegories. In addition, gross margins benefited 
                                  slightly over the last year due to an increased sa  les mix shift toward loose tea and reduction in 
                                  beverage sales.

                                  Look for continued SG&A investments.  We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to rise by 187 
                                  bps to 42.4% in 2011 and 82 bps to 43.2% in 2012  (following 100+ bps of year-over-year leverage 
                                  in each of the last four years) primarily due to   a significant increase in pre-opening and training 
                                  costs (driven by planned acceleration of new stor e openings over the next few years) as well as 
                                  infrastructure-related costs (including new corporate office rent, setup costs for Canada, distribution 
                                  center expansion and continued investments in IT). Moreover, we expect SG&A to be incrementally 
                                  pressured through 1H12 due to higher corporate costs associated with being a public company; 
                                  this includes additional costs for increased personnel in finance, legal and compliance, as well as 
                                  stock-based compensation.  Beginning in 2013, we expect SG&A costs to normalize, as this will be 
                                  the first year the Company fully anniversaries public company costs. 
                                   
                                  Teavana has significant opportunities in marketing and understanding customer loyalty. The 
                                  Company has been aggressively looking for a VP of Marketing for the past three to six months, and 
                                  hopes to have someone in place shortly, prior to  the anticipated launch of its CRM system in 2012. 
                                  Despite having very little customer-specific data, TEA does have a significant amount of store level 
                                  and SKU level data, which we think will be very usef ul in building a loyalty program to further drive 
                                  the average ticket and increase the number of tr ansactions (the bigger opportunity today). The 
                                  Companys ecommerce platform has been in oper      ation for four years now, which has helped 
                                  educate consumers on tea; however, this channel st ill represents a small portion of total sales (7% 
                                  as of FY10) and will likely grow at a steady   pace to 10% of the business in 2015. Though 
                                  management does not have a stated target for mark eting spend as a percent of sales, we believe 
                                  this will be a material increase in 2012 and 2013  (as the Company starts to build out the marketing 
                                  department and CRM program from nothing).

                                  We see long-term operating margin expansion opportunity.    After four consecutive years of 
                                  100-600+ bps of year-over-year expansion, we ex  pect Teavanas operating margins to contract 
                                  modestly in 2011 and 2012, before delivering expansion in 2013 and beyond, as the Company 
                                  begins to cycle its increased spending on infrastructure investments and public company costs. We 
                                  currently model an operating margin of 18.5% in  2011, and believe the Company could reach its 
                                  stated 21% operating margin goal over the next five years on a more mature business platform.

                                       compensation model; we think this helps institut        ionalize the highly consultative nature of the 
                                       business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, th  e stores theater differ entiates it from other 
                                       mall-based retailers, and we think evokes the best        from our lifestyle-focused retailers (including 
                                       lululemon athletica and Zumiez).

                                                     Exhibit 17: Initiation Checklist 
 
 Differentiated retail environment 
                                                       We think that Teavana has one of the most differentiated retail offerings in our 
                                                        coverage universe. The Wall of Tea adds to the theatrical element of the retail 
                                                        environment  we think it is as unique as our best-in-class retail 
                                                        environments (lululemon, Tiffany and Zumiez).   
                                                         
 Higher priced premium products 
                                                       There is a very wide product and pricing breadth, which makes the offering 
                                                        both accessible and aspirational. The premium teas are certainly a luxury 
                                                        item, but are much more affordable on a per cup basis  see Exhibit 27.  
                                                         
 Healthy living 
                                                       Tea has proven health benefits and has little or no calories.  

                                                         
 Strong management team 
                                                       We think the Teavana management team is one of the strongest in our 
                                                        coverage universe. Inside ownership, particularly by CEO Andrew Mack (56% 
                                                        holding) is very high. 
                                                         
 U.S growth 
                                               ?        The Company has at least a 500 store U.S. opportunity. However, more 
                                                        growth will come from less productive B mall locations. In addition, the 
                                                        Company has not embarked on street locations.

                                 Teavanas focus on differentiated flavor combinations makes its product sticky.    We like 
                                 that approximately 85% of Teavanas offering   are blends, and over 30% are what we would 
                                 characterize as complex blends.

                                 STRONG FOCUS ON STORE PERFORMANCE DRIVES A 
                                 CONSULTATIVE ENVIRONMENT 
                                 Teavana has an unusually disciplined focus on store operations.  Our field work uncovered a 
                                 very elaborate system of weekly grades for employees.  
                                  
                                 Monthly bonuses and grading instill accountability. Generally speaking, the trigger for bonus 
                                 payment, as well as the amount paid, is a func  tion of each salespersons weekly performance 
                                 grades (i.e., A, B, C, et c.) to determine the average monthly performance grade. An average 
                                 target sales/hour goal is determined each week and  is essentially a functi on of the expected run 
                                 rate of the store as compared to other stores (i.e., higher volume stores have higher sales targets). 
                                 Based upon the expected/planned sales volume for each store, a per hour sales goal is identified 
                                 each month for the respective stores salespeople.  For example, if the goal was $100/hour and the 
                                 actual average weekly sales per hour attribut  ed to a given staff member was greater than 
                                 $100/hour, then a top grade, such as an A+, would be given to that salesperson for the week. At 
                                 the end of the month, individua  l performance reviews are conducted with each salesperson to 
                                 determine if he/she will receive a monthly bonus  payout and the corresponding bonus amount. In 
                                 order to be eligible for bonus payout, the weekly performance grade average must be an A. 
                                 Additionally, if the weekly average for a given mont h is an A, a bonus is paid on only those sales 
                                 from the weeks when an A grade was achieved. 
                                  
                                 A focus on internal promotio n drives a strong culture.   The Company gives its employees 
                                 further incentive for top performance by making  internal promotion a key focus and strategy, 
                                 particularly with its aggressive new store opening  plans through 2015. Of the 50 stores opened in 
                                 2011, through 3Q11, 48 of them (or 96%) opened with general managers who were promoted from 
                                 within the Company. Management  believes that opening stores wi th internally promoted general 
                                 managers is critical, as this has historically improved consistency of service and store performance. 
                                 This 96% internal promotion rate for new stores  continues to improve; the 2011 run-rate is above 
                                 the 87% rate achieved in FY10 and 39% rate achieved in FY09.

                                     Expect new store model to remain profitable.    We believe new store openings will drive the 
                                     majority of year-over-year EPS growth for the next       four to five years, at 60-80 stores per year. 
                                     Despite the Companys high penetration in A malls across the United States, we think TEA has an 
                                     adequate amount of quality, lower  rent locations in B malls and street locations it could tap to 
                                     complete its 500-store goal by 2015. We believe this lower leverage point on occupancy expense is 
                                     key to the Companys store growth plan, which also assumes lower than historical average sales in 
                                     year one. Though the average size  of the stores opened in 2011 is about 15% higher than the 
                                     average size for stores opened in 2010 and prior,   occupancy cost as a percent of sales for the 
                                     2011 class is slightly lower than the class of 2010 and prior, and occupancy cost per gross square 
                                     foot is much lower than the class of 2010 and prio r. In addition, TEAs new store model requires a 
                                     lower amount of capital investment to open (a t $200,000-$250,000) compared to the Companys 
                                     historical average for new stores, thanks to a      lower average buildout cost and higher average 
                                     tenant allowances per new store. Despite a four-year ramp period to maturity, a new store typically 
                                     has a payback period of 18 months on its initial investment.

                                       COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 
                                       Teavana operates in a very fragmented competitive landscape. The U.S. tea market has grown 
                                       consistently in recent years, which has attrac ted numerous entrepreneurs and competitors into the 
                                       growing tea market. According to the U.S. Tea A  ssociation, the U.S. tea  market has grown at a 
                                       CAGR of 7.4% during the last 20  years. As of 2010, the  U.S. tea market was estimated to be $7.7 
                                       billion (wholesale value), which is up from $1.84  billion in 1990. However,  the U.S. tea market is 
                                       immature and competitors tend to be tea rooms,   which grew from 200 to 400 in the last decade 
                                       (source: U.S. Tea Association), coffee houses offe  ring specialty teas, and many different stand 
                                       alone tea stores, which offer a wide assortment  of tea products. Teavana currently has 196 owned 
                                       stores in the United States al  one and holds a significant market   share of the growing U.S. tea 
                                       market.  Davids Tea, a Canadian-based tea company, executes a similar strategy to Teavana with 
                                       more than 40 Canadian stores and two stores in New York City; expansion into the U.S. market 
                                       began at the end of 2011. Through  our proprietary fieldwork, we discovered that Davids Teas has 
                                       plans in place to expand to six stores in the NYC area in the very near term and has plans for 
                                       aggressive growth throughout the United States during 2012. We believe Davids Tea could quickly 
                                       become one of Teavanas more significant competitive threats in the U.S. market. 
                                        
                                       The U.S. tea market remains immature relative to other countries.  The Companys business is 
                                       highly concentrated on a single, discretionary       product category, premium loose teas and tea-
                                       related merchandise, and is dependent upon signific ant growth of the U.S.  Tea market as well as 
                                       healthy consumer spending. These discretionary purchases may decline during recessionary 
                                       periods or at other times when disposable income is lower. According to the Tea Association of the 
                                       USA, Inc., the U.S. tea market is expected to grow  from $7.7 billion in 2010 to nearly $15 billion by 
                                       the end of 2014, and the specialty tea portion of the tea market will be the fastest growing segment, 
                                       with annual increases in the 10-20% range (sour         ce: U.S. Tea Association). The ability of the 
                                       Company to educate U.S. consumers on the many pos itive attributes of tea  as compared to other 
                                       drink options, such as soda or coffee, and help drive growth of the overall U.S. tea market is critical 
                                       to the future growth prospects of the business in  spite of the robust outlook for the U.S. tea market 
                                       and specialty tea growth projections.   In addition to beverage alternatives to tea, competition looms 
                                       from other specialty retailers who offer products that vie for consumers disposable income dollars.

                                  EXPECT STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT SALES GROWTH TO CONTINUE 
                                  We believe strong sales trends should continue.  In 3Q11, sales increased 35% year-over-year 
                                  following four consecutive years of 35%+ in  creases year-over-year, despite macroeconomic 
                                  pressures in 2008-2009. Sales growth over the la  st four years has benefit ed from a significant 
                                  number of new store openings (admittedly off a small base of 47 stores in 2006) and a consistently 
                                  rising average ticket. We expect sales to grow in   the 20-30% range over the next several years, 
                                  aided by new store openings, increasing average ticket, greater traffic and transactions, as well as 
                                  improved product offerings.

                                  #1  ACCELERATED     N EW  S TORE   O PENINGS IN THE   U NITED  S TATES   
                                  Expect 60-80 openings per year.  We believe that TEA can maintain one of the highest growth 
                                  rates in our coverage universe over the next four to five years, with new store openings to drive the 
                                  majority of year-over-year EPS growth. Despite the Companys high penetration in A malls across 
                                  the country, we think TEA has an adequate amount of  quality, lower rent locations in B malls as 
                                  well as some street locations it could tap to complete its 500-store goal by 2015. We think the lower 
                                  rent structure should more than offset the lowe  r than historical average sales PSF in year one, 
                                  thereby helping to maintain the profitability of t he new store base. Additionally, we think expansion 
                                  should become easier as the store base grows because the Company will be able to leverage a 
                                  bigger pool of store managers and trained sales   associates as well as its upgraded information 
                                  systems to help with future openings. Finally, we think TEAs sales should benefit over time from a 
                                  new CRM and marketing program, which should        drive higher traffic, transactions and new 
                                  customers to the concept. 
                                   
                                  #2  INTERNATIONAL    E XPANSION    
                                  International expansion through both franchise and owned stores.    With franchise royalty 
                                  income representing less than 1% of total sales in FY10 (ended January 30, 2011), we believe that 
                                  the international segment could become a meaningful  contributor to earnings over time. Since the 
                                  end of 2010, the Company added three franchise stores in Mexico; TEA now operates a total of 18 
                                  franchise stores, including 16 in Mexico (via Casa Internacional) and two in the United States. The 
                                  Company also signed a multi-year franchise agreement with Alshaya in September 2011, to 
                                  develop mall-based Teavana stores in eight countries  across the Middle East (including Bahrain, 
                                  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Lebano n and Jordan). The first store in the Middle 
                                  East is expected to open later this year. The Company's franchise agreements provide franchise 
                                  rights for a period of 10-15 years and require franchisees to sell products solely purchased from 
                                  TEA. These stores carry a similar selection of   tea and non-tea merchandise but have a higher 
                                  percentage of beverage sales than TEA's owned stores. In addition, the Company entered Canada 
                                  during 4Q11 by opening a directly owned retail stor e. We believe that while the majority of TEA's 
                                  international expansion will be through franchis e stores, the Company will open directly owned 
                                  stores in select markets. Over the near term, we  believe TEA will look to enter Western Europe;

                                  and over the longer term, TEA will likely look to   enter South America, Russia, India, China, 
                                  Australia and Africa. 
                                   
                                  #3  P OTENTIAL   E NTRANCE INTO     CPG 
                                  Over time, Teavana could enter the CPG market.  We think the Company will tread carefully in 
                                  this arena given the premium positioning in the market. The current iteration of single-cup brewer 
                                  machines is not ideal for tea preparation given that they do not steep, rather, they focus on passing 
                                  hot water quickly. However, a number of companies have added innovation to their tea machines, 
                                  including Brevilles automatic tea maker. A seco nd potential offering is a ready-to-drink product. 
                                  There have been a number of offerings in this space (Teas Tea, Tazo, Honest Tea, among others). 
                                  However, given the strength of Teav anas brand as well as its proprietary tea blends, we think this 
                                  could provide a long-term opportunity.

                                  The Company is highly reliant on a small number of vendors.  The Company does not own or 
                                  operate any tea estates, blending operations or   manufacturing facilities. Instead, the Company 
                                  relies on more than 100 vendors to supply single-estate and specially blended teas as well as tea-
                                  related merchandise on a continuous basis. T EA does not have long-term purchase contracts with 
                                  the vendors or other contractual assurances of   continued supply, pricing or exclusive access to 
                                  products; any of the Companys suppliers or m anufacturers could discontinue supplying Teavana 
                                  with loose-leaf tea or tea-related merchandise in sufficient quantities. During FY10, the Companys 
                                  two largest vendors supplied 40% of its total    inventory purchases. The Company could be 
                                  adversely affected if any of its vendors entered in to arrangements with Teavanas competitors to 
                                  sell similar tea products, including giving competitors exclusive licensing arrangements or exclusive 
                                  access to tea blends and other products or limit ing TEAs access to such arrangements or blends 
                                  or other products. In addition, TEA would be adve   rsely affected if other natural/macro events 
                                  occurred, such as weather, crop disease, labor relations, import/export and customs difficulties. We 
                                  believe TEA has a very seasoned merchandising team who has very well-established relationships 
                                  with some of the industrys most experienced a nd influential tea brokers and tea gardens around 
                                  the world. As such, we think the quality and ble  nds of tea that Teavana offers are not easily 
                                  duplicable.

                                   A move to direct sourcing for non-tea merchandise has helped improve gross margins.  The 
                                   Company's move to direct sourcing for non-tea merchandise late in 3Q10 has led to significant 
                                   year-over-year increases in gross margin over       the last four quarters  as well as substantial 
                                   increases in inventory (both in the warehouse a nd in-transit). With this  strategy shift, TEA not only 
                                   gained greater control of the production and distribu tion of its non-tea merchandise categories, but 
                                   also captured the distributor marg in and forged stronger direct relationships with the factories. We 
                                   believe the improved factory relationships should help TEA greatly in the future as the Company 
                                   continues to develop innovative, customized products to sell on an exclusive basis. On the flipside, 
                                   the procurement of loose tea continues to be s    ourced primarily through tea brokers, which we 
                                   believe may be the most efficient manner to garner the product.

                                   Liquidity remains strong.  Teavana maintains an amended $40 million revolving credit facility 
                                   (maturing on April 22, 2016), which includes a $5 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of 
                                   credit. This facility is secured by substantially all  of the assets of the Com pany. On July 27, 2011, 
                                   the Company used net IPO proceeds of $15 million to redeem all outstanding shares of its Series A 
                                   redeemable preferred stock (val ued at $10.7 million as of the   IPO date) and to repay the $1.0 
                                   million outstanding balance (as of May 1, 2011) on   its amended revolving credit facility with Fifth 
                                   Third Bank.  
                                    
                                   As of October 30, 2011,  the Company had an outstanding balanc e of $4.5 million on its revolver, 
                                   $0.2 million of undrawn face amounts on letters of  credit, and $35.3 million of availability for future 
                                   borrowings. Working capital at quarter-end totaled $29.9 million compared to $1.9 million at the end 
                                   of FY10 (ended January 30, 2011); not e: current liabilities in 2010 included $13.0 million of Series 
                                   A redeemable preferred stock. TEA had no additio  nal long-term debt outstanding outside of the 
                                   $4.5 million on the above-mentioned revolver. Cash   balances at the end of 3Q11 were low, at 
                                   $0.036 million, due to the seasonality of its business   with the greatest increase in working capital 
                                   spend in the 2Q and 3Q in anticipation of the peak holiday selling season in the 4Q. We think cash 
                                   balances at the end of 2011 (estimated at $7.6 million) should return to similar levels as the end of 
                                   last year ($7.9 million). Moreover, we believe the Company should generate positive free cash flow 
                                   in 2012 and going forward.

                                 Founded in 1997, Teavana offers premium loos  e teas and tea-related merchandise through a 
                                 distinctive store ambiance, know  ledgeable staff and healthy living lifestyle. Inspired by their 
                                 international travels and passion for tea, CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy Mack, wanted to 
                                 make high-quality teas easily accessible and opened  their first store in Atlanta, Ga. To expand its 
                                 store base, Teavana targeted high traffic locati  ons within malls, lifestyle centers and other high 
                                 sales volume retail venues. In 2004, the Company partnered with Parallel Investment Partners for 
                                 capital resources and strategic advice to support accelerated growth plans. From 2006 to 2011, the 
                                 Company grew from 47 to 196 (as of 3Q11) stores , more than tripling it s store base. Each store 
                                 offers a unique Heaven of Tea environment, equi  pped with highly interactive and well-trained 
                                 teaologists to guide customers in understanding tea and its health benefits.

                                 Teavanas management team is highly entrepreneurial.  With his comprehensive knowledge of 
                                 the retailing business, Andrew Mack founded and  served as CEO of Teavana since 1997. In 2005, 
                                 Daniel Glennon joined to serve as CFO. He has extensive experience serving as CFO or VP of 
                                 Finance for three small or early stage corporations . Peter Luckhurst serves as EVP of Operations 
                                 and was promoted within the Company after serving as VP for Stores from 2005-2010. With 
                                 tenured executives, we believe the management   team will strongly execute Teavanas growth 
                                 strategy. Insider ownership remains  very high, as founder Andrew Mack still owns roughly 
                                 56% of the Company.
