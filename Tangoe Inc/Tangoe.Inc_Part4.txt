Valuation/Risks
n  Valuation: TNGO shares trade at 5.5x 1Q12 run-rate revenues, matching the SaaS average. We see upside to its multiple over the year as investors recognize its superior
   growth opportunity and use a 7.5x multiple a year out as the basis for our $30.00 target.
n  Risks: Acquisition integration, acceptance of the SaaS model, and a limited public track record are key investment risks.
