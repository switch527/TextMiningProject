                                                    The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact of 
                                                     acquisitions and inflation.  

                                                    Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                                     operators that CHEF serves.  

                                                    Given the current economic situation, an update on the trends management is seeing in

                                                    Sales trends into 4Q11. 

                                                    Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its 
                                                     customers.  

                                                    An update on the progress of the rollout of the warehouse management system to the 
                                                     Washington, DC facility, and how the company is progressing against its timeline to

                                          declining 75 bp to 25.2%. We forecast operati                 ng expenses (excluding D&A) grow 9.1% to 
                                          $16.8 million, a 70 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 20 bp deterioration 
                                          in operating margins to 7.2%, or $6.9 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $7.5 million, a 5 bp

                                 with gross margins improving 2 bp to 26.0%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) 
                                 grow 15.9% to $72.0 million, a 39 bp year-over-year improvement in margin  leading to a 
                                 49 bp improvement in operating margins to 7.0%, or $27.4 million. This gets us to EBITDA of 
                                 $29.7 million, a 42 bp improvement in margin to 7.6%. We assume interest expense of $1.2 
                                 million, a 39.1% tax rate and 20.9 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.77.
