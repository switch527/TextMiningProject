                                      •  Guidance is ahead of expectations.  TNAV looks for F4Q PF EPS of $0.18-$0.20 
                                         on revenue of $52-$54mm (JPM prior est $0.16/$49.4mm, street $0.17/$50.2mm).  
                                         We are adjusting estimates to align, and we are taking up estimates through CY12, 
                                         primarily because gross margins are not d  eclining as rapidly as we anticipated, 
                                         notwithstanding the shift to fixed revenues at Sprint.   

                                      •  We maintain a Neutral Rating for TNAV , but we believe an upward re-rating to 
                                         the multiple is justified by three quarters of solid execution following the 
                                         disappointing revision to the Sprint contract that took place in July 2010.  Our Price 
                                         Target goes to $13.00 based on 6 times revised CY12E EV/EBITDA of $64.3mm, 
                                         a one-turn increase to the multiple.

                                     Valuation  

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is close to fully 
                                     valued, in our view, and  we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     improved metrics relating to the growth of auto, premium and ad-based navigation 
                                     services, and better visibility into re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth. 

                                     Our December 2011 price target is $13.00 based on an assigned multiple of 6 times 
                                     revised CY12E PF EBITDA of $64.3mm (previously $58.1m).  Our revised multiple 
                                     is one turn closer to the mean for the comms software/services peer group current 
                                     median multiple of ~7x, but with a discount that takes into consideration significant 
                                     shifts and risks in the competitive landscape (free navigation solutions, Android 
                                     gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining share in autos).

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                              and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                              navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                              expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                              market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                              growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                              reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                              TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                              owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                              leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
