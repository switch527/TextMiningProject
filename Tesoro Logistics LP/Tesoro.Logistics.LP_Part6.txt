                                          fourth quarter of 2011. The distribution represents a 3.6% increase over the $0.35/unit ($1.40/
                                          unit annualized) for the third quarter of 2011.
                                          We are maintaining our 2012 distribution estimate at $1.575/unit and our 2013 distribution
                                          estimate at $1.83/unit. Our estimates provide a 16.2% growth rate in 2013. This compares quite
                                          favorably to the 7.1% estimated average growth in 2013 for liquids-based partnerships under
                                          our coverage. Our distributable cash flow estimates are $2.12/unit for 2012 and $2.60/unit in
                                          2013, which equates to coverage ratios of 1.3x and 1.4x, respectively.

                                         Estimates
                                         We are lowering our 2012 EBITDA estimate to $75.8 million from $79.6 million and keeping
                                         our 2013 EBITDA estimate at $100.1 million. We are reducing our 2012 DCF estimate to $66.3
                                         million from $69.4 million and maintaining our 2013 DCF estimate at $83.7 million. Our higher
                                         estimates primarily reflect slightly higher costs in 2012.

   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $38.08.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.
