• Presenting at the conference were CEO Andrew Mack and CFO Dan Glennon.                  212 284-9315, alex.j.fuhrman@pjc.com
                                                                                          Related Companies:        Share Price:
• Management discussed its pending acquisition of Teaopia, which was announced on         TEA                          13.42
  4/16/12. Teaopia is a 46-store chain that began operations in 2005 and looks, acts,
  smells, and feels a lot like Teavana. During its presentation, management characterized
  Teaopia as a business occupying a profitable niche in Canada, but with meaningful
  opportunity to improve profitability by converting its stores into Teavana locations
  and improving store-level execution. We believe sales and margin expansion tied to this
  integration are on deck in the years to come. Our FY13 EPS estimate includes about
  $0.05 in integration costs associated with the acquisition. Excluding these integration
  costs, management expects the acquisition to be accretive by $0.03-$0.04 to EPS in
  FY13.

• Management elaborated on its real estate strategy. It appears that Teavana is having
  success in expanding to new markets and is exploring new real estate formats, such as
  a broader street location strategy. Management indicated that it plans to open a store
  in New York City this July near the corner of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue.

• Regarding cost control, management sees opportunity to increase operating margins
  by containing product costs as well as by leveraging SG&A as the business grows.
  Longer-term, management indicated that it believes it can achieve a low-twenties
  operating margin as the business scales and loose tea represents an increasingly large
  share of total company revenue.

• Management also discussed the potential of launching a consumer packaged goods
  line for sale through other channels. Although the time line for the development of
  a CPG line was not discussed, management indicated it believes the high-end tea
  category is under penetrated in the grocery channel, and cited several examples of
  coffee brands which have thoughtfully executed a brand-sensitive channel expansion.
  We believe the launch of a CPG line could be meaningfully accretive within the first
  year or two of operations, although management has not yet discussed firm plans to
  make such a move.

• We rate TEA shares Overweight with a $25 price target based on 30x FY14E EPS.
RISKS TO ACHIEVEMENT OF PRICE TARGET
Macroeconomic pressures, risk to opening stores internationally and working with
franchise partners, reliance on key top management, limited ability to hedge costs.

  Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At times
     analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock performance
     is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at www.piperjaffray.com/
     researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there is no active analyst opinion
     or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should not be relied upon as individual
     investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual circumstances, including existing holdings,
     time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other
     information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions than those expressed by the research
     analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies and may contradict the opinions contained
     in fundamental research reports.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects
     the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                     would expect a large number of new stores in its comp 
                     base would provide a consistent and reliable comp lift. 

                     Long-term outlook appears less rosy. Given 
                     significant comp deceleration, we revisited our 
                     bull/base/bear case scenarios and lowered our base 
                     case valuation to $16. While store openings are likely to 
                     continue to generate top line growth, we are concerned 
                     about EPS expansion after TEA reaches saturation 
                     (which we estimate is about 300-500 stores). We revise 
                     our base case price with our updated 2015 EPS 
                     estimate of $1.20. We believe TEAs multiple may 
                     continue to contract unless the company is able to show               Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                     stable positive transaction trends and strong consistent              companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

                                                     Could near-term store growth be masking long-term earnings growth? Perhaps.

                                                     productivity of the TEA stores ($435 per door vs. $913 at a TEA store), which presents
                                                     a meaningful opportunity. Both, over time, should drive a higher penetration of loose
                                                     tea. We believe this could drive 25%+ earnings growth in 2H12 and 2013, even without

VALUATION
At 24.2x 2012 P/E, 11.2x 2012 EV/EBITDA and 0.8x 2012 PEG, we believe valuation is opportunistic for a high-growth retailer.
We think the Company can accelerate earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new
store economics. Thus, we think Teavana should trade at a premium based on our $26 price target, which implies a 45.5x P/E on our
$0.57 2012 EPS estimate. Currently, the active and healthy lifestyle peer group trades at 30.8x 2012 P/E, 12.8x 2012 EV/EBITDA and
1.4x 2012 PEG. Additionally, TEA currently trades at a 2.4x 2012 EV/Sales compared to 2.2x EV/Sales for the peer group.

RISKS
Risks that could impede the stock from reaching our price target include, but are not limited to the following: ability to identify
suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior and retention of senior management.

         LOOKING FORWARD 
         Long-term earnings growth. While comp growth lost momentum, sales increased 26.8% year-over-year and store expansion 
         plans are ahead of plan (23 openings vs. 18-20 guided for 1Q12). Looking forward, the Company plans to continue its store 
         growth plans and we believe Teavana will be able to achieve +25% earnings growth in the long term.  
          
                 Store penetration of high-traffic, domestic malls. There seems to be some runway in store penetration given that 
                  approximately 50 A-mall locations will remain untouched at the end of 2012. Additionally, roughly half of the 60 planned 
                  openings in FY12 will be located in A-malls. With 23 stores opened in 1Q12, the Company expects to open 13-14 
                  stores in 2Q12. 
                 Integrating Teaopia. The Company expects the acquisition to close in 2Q12 and subsequently plans to rebrand all 
                  Teaopia stores as Teavana. In the following months, the Company will be sending Teaopia’s management teams to 
                  Atlanta, Ga. for training and hopes that this, combined with Teavana’s exclusive products and merchandising strategy, 
                  will drive Teaopia’s sales productivity closer to Teavana’s.

                 RISKS 

                 The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk, particularly on the 

                 downside. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our upside price target include but are not limited to deterioration in 

                 the consumer spending environment, slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk associated with being in 

                 a seasonal, cyclical, and trend focused sector. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our downside price target include 

                 but are not limited to a significant positive improvement in the overall economy, which would subsequently impact consumer 

                 buying behavior.     

                  

                 Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our UPSIDE price target include but are not limited to 

                 the following: ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior and retention of 

                 senior management.

 Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates
 received compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely
 correspond with "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent
 recommended relative weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See
 Stock Rating definitions below.

                   margins were higher than expected at 64.1% vs. MSe 
                   63.0% (+1c), offset by higher SG&A of 46.2% vs. our 
                   44.5% estimate (-1c) resulting in operating margin 
                   50bps lower than MSe 14.4%.

                   (+1.6%). Including beverage sales, store only comps 
                   were -0.1% (vs. MSe +2.0%) driven by -0.3% 
                   transactions and +0.2% average ticket. We are 
                   concerned about the companys future ability to drive 
                   traffic and maintain positive comps. 

                   Store openings drive growth. TEA opened more new 
                   doors than expected (23 vs. 18-20 guidance) in the 
                   quarter, ending with 223 stores. FY store opening plan 
                   remains on track for 60 new stores.  

                   Inventory/sqft growth decreases -7.7%. The direct 
                   sourcing initiative continues to lower inventory levels 
                   after seeing large increases last year. Total inventory 
                   growth slows to 25.9% vs. a 51.7% 4Q increase and 
                   compared to 26.8% sales growth in the quarter.

                   2012 guidance. Q2 guidance calls for 13-14 new stores

Disclosure information regarding historical ratings and price targets is available at  http://www.wedbush.com/ResearchDisclosure/DisclosureQ112.pdf

Outperform: Expect the total return of the stock to outperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Neutral: Expect the total return of the stock to perform in-line with the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Underperform: Expect the total return of the stock to underperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) 
coverage universe over the next 6-12 months.

other stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe (or the analyst’s team coverage).*

The Distribution of Ratings is required by FINRA rules; however, WS’ stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and Underperform most closely 
conform to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively. Please note, however, the definitions are not the same as WS’ stock ratings are on a relative 
basis.  
 
The  analysts  responsible  for  preparing  research  reports  do  not  receive  compensation  based  on  specific  investment  banking  activity.  The 
analysts receive compensation that is based upon various factors including WS’ total revenues, a portion of which are generated by WS’ 
investment banking activities.

           FY Jan      2011A     2012E     2013E      The Teaopia acquisition can drive meaningful long-term earnings growth. As
                                                      noted previously, we think Teavana's acquisition of Canadian retailer Teaopia should
           1Q           $0.09     $0.10        --
                                                      drive about $0.16 in earnings (see Exhibit 2) once fully converted to the Teavana store

                                                      model, product and selling culture. TEA acquired this 46-store retail chain for $26.9
           3Q           $0.02     $0.03        --     million in an all cash transaction. The transaction will be neutral to earnings in FY12
           4Q           $0.32     $0.42        --     and $0.03-$0.04 accretive in FY13. Over time, TEA's management expects to raise
           YEAR         $0.46     $0.59     $0.81     Teaopia's sales productivity levels (currently at less than half of Teavana's) to Teavana's
           First Call     --     $0.60E    $0.80E     levels. Management seems happy with the acquired asset base and believes that it can
           P/E          45.4x     35.4x     25.8x     quickly implement the Teavana labor model and product offering.

                                                      CPG opportunity. In contrast to the average tea offering in grocery stores today (which
                                                      are stored in a warehouse for a few years before getting packaged and distributed),
                                                      Teavana's teas typically turn every month. While management would not commit to a
                                                      timeline on a CPG offering, it is clear that all options remain on the table. Specifically,
                                                      management seemed open to a grocery store offering, single serve offering, and
                                                      bottled drinks.

                                                      Innovation. Teavana continues to rollout new product introductions, with a new iced
                                                      tea campaign launching this summer and 15 new tea flavors this fall. Importantly, the
                                                      Company also continues to innovate in the tea merchandise category, particularly as
                                                      it endeavors to make brewing tea more convenient. Finally, look for the Company to
                                                      focus on a CRM system after it hires a new VP of Marketing.

VALUATION
At 35.4x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.1x 2012 PEG, we believe valuation is attractive for a high-growth retailer. We
think the Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong
new store economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average
of 32.1x 2012 P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 16.3x 2012 EV/EBITDA
compared to 13.4x EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We reiterate our $28 price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59
2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk. Risks include, but are not
limited to: deterioration in the consumer spending environment, slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk
associated with being in a seasonal, cyclical, and trend focused sector.

Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our price target include but are not limited to the following:
ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, retention of senior management.

                 RISKS 

                 The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk, particularly on the 

                 downside. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our upside price target include but are not limited to deterioration in 

                 the consumer spending environment, slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk associated with being in 

                 a seasonal, cyclical, and trend focused sector. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our downside price target include 

                 but are not limited to a significant positive improvement in the overall economy, which would subsequently impact consumer 

                 buying behavior.     

                  

                 Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our UPSIDE price target include but are not limited to 

                 the following: ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, retention of 

                 senior management.

Investment Thesis 

We believe Best-in-Class ROI Justifies Industry-Leading Unit Growth    

We believe Teavana can sustain its industry-leading unit growth rate, given its 75% year-1 cash-on-cash return, which is the highest 
within our restaurants universe, including beverage peers (Figures 1-2), through 2015. Importantly, management has been able to 
sustain this level of cash-on-cash returns even as a greater mix of newer units open in Tier-2 malls, and achieve lower expected sales 
levels of $600-700K than the current system average of ~$900K.   
Much  of  the  debate  has  centered  on  what  Teavana’s  opportunity  is,  beyond  500  stores  in  2015  (from  200  currently),  and  an 
examination  of  the  many  hypothetical  opportunities,  both  unit  growth  and  other  (CPG,  licensing,  international,  etc.)  have  been 
exhausted.  While we believe Canada adds upside to the 500 unit target, particularly given the pending Teaopia acquisition, we believe 
a footprint beyond 500 units in the U.S. would not support current economics given the ceiling on locations that can support the 
company’s sales productivity (Figure 3).   
Nevertheless, we would note that even if there were no unit growth or other opportunities beyond 500 units in 2015, we believe the 
company’s mature-level cash flow would be enough to repurchase ~11-13% of shares outstanding per year at the current share price, 
resulting in double-digit EPS growth in 2016, even with relatively conservative assumptions regarding revenue and margins (Figure 4).

Believe Focus on Comps ex. eCommerce to be Misplaced, but Likely to Continue  

We believe that as a Teavana unit matures, characteristics specific to the concept could result in muted average check and transaction 
growth  within  the  store.    Therefore,  unlike  a  typical  growth  concept,  we  believe  that  SSS  growth,  excluding  e-Commerce,  is 
inappropriate as a measure of the concept’s ongoing success, and look to SSS growth, including eCommerce, as the appropriate 
measure.  Nevertheless, we believe that continued focus on in-store SSS metrics is likely in the near- term.    

We illustrate what we believe is the risk to in-store comparable sales metrics as a unit matures (Figure 5).  We believe that average 
check pressure occurs as a returning visitor no longer needs to purchase accompanying merchandise, and traffic pressure results from 
migrations to online purchases over time.

Transactions and Average Check  

Historically, transactions have remained flat to down, with average check growth being the main driver of SSS growth, ex. eCommerce, 
(Figures 6-7).  While declining beverage sales as a mix of total sales has contributed to the decline in transactions and the growth in 
average size, in recent years, the beverage mix has stabilized at 4% of sales (Figure 8).  We also estimate this impact as no more than 
9 bps of improvement in average check per 10 bp decline in the mix of beverage sales (Figure 9).

The most significant contributor to increased average ticket has been a higher price paid per unit and a higher number of units per 
transaction (Figure 10).  The company does not typically increase menu prices, and we believe the impact of a higher number of units 
per  transaction  is  offset  by  a  decline  in the number of  transactions over  time.    Therefore,  we  believe  the  sole sustainable comp 
contributor is the company’s ability to drive a higher price per unit by consistently driving customers to trade up to higher-priced teas.   
We believe the marginal impact of this driver diminishes as a unit matures, with an increasing mix of units in their second year or older 
starting in 2012 (Figures 11-12).  Combined with the impact of a higher proportion of sales that we believe migrate online as a store 
matures and enters the comp base (Figure 13), we are not surprised that management’s 2012 guidance of “mid-single-digit” SSS 
growth, including eCommerce, implies a deceleration in ex-eCommerce SSS growth to the low-single-digits from 5.5% in 2011 and 
8.7% in 2010.

Believe   Estimates,   Excluding   Teaopia,   Acquisition,  are   Lofty   due   to   Aggressive   Consensus   Comps   ex.   eCommerce 
Expectations    
Given 2012 revenue guidance of $208-215 million, on SSS growth including eCommerce of “mid-single digits”, we believe downside to 
Street  revenue  expectations  (prior  to  the  Teaopia  acquisition  announcement  last  week)  of  $215.2  million  exists.      We  estimate 
eCommerce revenue in 2011 was $12.8 million, and expect 37% growth in 2012 to $17.6 million (Figure 14).  Our analysis indicates 
that eCommerce growth will contribute 4.2% to 2012 SSS growth, with a 2.1% contribution from in-store SSS growth (Figure 15).  We 
believe the higher Street expectations relative to management guidance and our expectation is the result of more aggressive in-store 
(ex. eCommerce) SSS growth expectations.

Excluding Teaopia Impact, Expect Resumption in Gross and Operating Margin Leverage in 2013, but 2012 Margins Capped   

Excluding the pending Teaopia acquisition, we expect 2012 operating margin of 18.7% vs. 2011 operating margin of 18.8%.  We expect 
operating margin expansion in 2013 to 19.8% (Figures 16-17).  With the company’s direct sourcing move fully anniversaried in 2011, 
we expect any gross margin benefit to come from the natural maturation process of stores, as higher-margin tea sales increase relative 
to merchandise sales.  Nevertheless, we believe the benefit from this maturation process over time may currently be overblown.  With a 
new store’s tea sales mix growing to 60% of sales from 50% at opening, and tea gross margins ~10% above non-tea gross margins, a 
store’s gross margins expand no more than 1% (Figure 18).  In 2012, we believe this impact will be somewhat diminished by the 
reacceleration in new unit growth that took place in 2010, as the mix of mature units dips slightly (Figure 19).  Combined with higher 
growth of lower-gross-margin eCommerce sales, we are modeling only a 20 bp increase in gross margins in 2012, accelerating to 50 
bps in 2013 as the impact of immature units begins to decrease (Figure 20).  We expect SG&A costs to pressure operating margins by 
30 bps in 2012 as the first half of 2012 is impacted 200-300 bps from public company costs not present in 1H:11, deleverage that is 
mostly recouped in 2H:12 (Figures 21-22).  Our 2012 EPS expectation, excluding the impact of Teaopia, is $0.60, below the pre-
acquisition consensus of $0.62.  Management guidance is $0.58-0.61.

Believe Pending Teaopia Acquisition Adds New Layer of Uncertainty, Given Expected Adverse Impact on Margins in Near-to-
Medium Term    

While the pending Teaopia acquisition answers some strategic questions and we believe Teavana can benefit from lifting Teaopia’s 
average unit volumes over time, the only certainty accompanying the acquisition is that near- to mid-term margins will be pressured.  
Although management provided no details on the acquisition call regarding Teaopia’s margins, given that average Teaopia sales per 
store of $435K are less than half of Teavana’s average of $913K, that loose-leaf tea as a % of revenue of ~50% is less than Teavana’s 
55%, and that absolute dollar occupancy costs are at 100% of Teavana occupancy costs, we believe both gross and operating margins 
are meaningfully lower.   
Additionally, while we believe management’s ability in lifting Teaopia’s sales levels is aided by the fact that Teaopia is essentially a 
copycat operation, down to the POS system used (Figures 23-24), management did state that it plans to increase labor expense ahead 
of sales growth, which we believe could impact 2013’s expected $0.03-0.04 of accretion should the expected sales lift come in below 
expectations.  Excluding transaction costs of $0.04-0.05, mostly in Q1-Q3, management expects the acquisition to have no impact on 
2012 EPS.  We are not including the ~$16 million in annual revenues, or any EPS impact, in our model pending the acquisition’s close 
in Q2.  We are, however, including a penny of transaction costs in 1Q:12, which lowers our 2012 EPS expectation to $0.59 from $0.60.  
Should we include the entire impact in our model, our 2012 EPS expectation would decrease to $0.55-0.56 and our 2013 EPS estimate 
would increase by $0.02-0.03.

Valuation 

Based on both consensus and our 2013 EPS expectations, Teavana is currently trading in line with its closest comparables.  Given the 
company’s brief trading history since its late July IPO, we do not believe a historical valuation analysis is appropriate.  Based on 
Teavana’s 36% expected EPS growth rate in 2013 relative to the peer average of 27%, a premium to peers would be appropriate.  
However,  within  the  context  of  our  expectation  that  there  is  risk  to  consensus  expectations,  combined  with  the  execution  risk  of 
integrating this relatively large-sized acquisition, we believe a valuation in line with the 26x peer multiple is appropriate.  Therefore, we 
initiate on shares of Teavana with a NEUTRAL rating and $21 price target, which represents a 26x multiple on our 2013 EPS estimate

Investment Risks 
 
 
Decrease in Demand for Teas 
 
Teavana is heavily reliant on the sale of premium loose leaf teas and tea-related products, therefore any decrease in the demand of 
teas from changing consumer tastes away from teas to substitute products could adversely impact sales.   
 
Increasing Competition in the Beverage Industry 
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive with an abundance of substitutes for premium loose leaf teas. We believe that increased 
competition from other tea and beverage retailers could adversely impact sales.  
 
Sourcing of Teas 
 
Teavana is reliant on its ability to source a wide variety of premium loose leaf teas at reasonable prices. We believe that any failure to 
innovate, develop, source, or market new varieties of teas could negatively impact sales. Additionally, any rise in the prices of loose leaf 
teas could negatively impact Teavana’s margins. 
 
Expansion into New Markets 
 
As Teavana expands into new markets, there is a risk that the new unit openings may not achieve sales levels appropriate to meet the 
company’s return on investment hurdles. We believe that new store openings may place increased demands on management and 
distribution. Additionally, management does not have the experience of opening the number of new stores that are planned annually.  
 
Deterioration in Economic Conditions 
 
The  company  is  dependent on  consumer  confidence  and  spending  and  any  deterioration  in  economic conditions  could adversely 
impact sales. We believe that sales could be negatively impacted by rising unemployment rates and increases in fuel and other energy 
costs.

                                                      specialty tea retailer, for $26.9 million in an all-cash transaction. Teavana will use cash

                                                      The    acquisition    should    drive    long-term    earnings    growth.    Teaopia    had
           First Call      --    $0.62E    $0.79E
                                                      approximately CAD $17 million in sales for its 46 company-owned stores in high-
           P/E          43.0x     33.5x      24.4x    quality  mall  locations  across  Canada.  Despite  a  similar  product  mix,  overall  mall
                                                      productivity and loose-leaf tea contribution, Teaopia had sales productivity less than
                                                      half Teavana ($435,000 at Teaopia vs. $913,000 at Teavana). We believe that, over
                                                      time, Teavana's management team can raise sales productivity levels to Teavana's
                                                      levels. Should management be successful in achieving this and driving a 25% four-wall
                                                      contribution margin (similar to Teavana in the United States), the transaction could be
                                                      (excluding transaction costs and interest expense) up to $0.16 accretive ± see Exhibit 2.

                                                      The important takeaway: Teavana has a truly unique store operating model. We
                                                      find it interesting that a similar ± okay, basically a copycat ± concept (similar look,
                                                      store size, mall productivity, loose leaf tea contribution, and even POS) can have a
                                                      sales productivity less than half of Teavana's. What does this mean to us? We think
                                                      it shows that Teavana's ªspecialnessº arises not from its store format or product mix.
                                                      Rather, it stems from its unique, highly consultative store model as well as its unique
                                                      products. The aforementioned are what give rise to Teavana's $1,000 per square foot
                                                      sales productivity, and frankly, despite the best efforts of competitors, are not easily
                                                      duplicated.

VALUATION
At 33.5x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.1x 2012 PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high-growth retailer. We think the
Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new store
economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average of 31.6x 2012
P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 15.6x 2012 EV/EBITDA compared to 13.1x
EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We reiterate our $28 price target, which implies a 47.4x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
Risks that could impede TEA from reaching our price target include, but are not limited to the following: ability to identify
suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, retention of senior management.

                 RISKS 

                 The primary risks to our ratings and price targets continue to center around macroeconomic risk, particularly on the 

                 downside. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our upside price target include, but are not limited to: deterioration in 

                 the consumer spending environment, a slowdown in comparable store sales growth, and the fashion risk associated with being 

                 in a seasonal, cyclical and trend focused  sector. Risks that could impede a stock from reaching our downside price target, 

                 include but are not limited to:  a significant positive improvement in the overall economy,  which would subsequently impact 

                 consumer buying behavior.

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                   We are positive on Teavanas recently announced                 Shr price, close (Apr 16, 2012)               $19.76
                   $26.9M acquisition of Teaopia. We believe Teaopia               Mkt cap, curr (mm)                             $779
                   offers a low risk path to expand Teavanas Canadian             52-Week Range                            $29.35-14.28
                   store footprint given its international aspirations. 
                   Teaopias 46 stores generate CAD $17M in revenue and 
                   management expects the acquisition to be EPS neutral 
                   (or $0.04$0.05 dilutive from transaction expenses) in 
                   2012 and accretive by $0.03$0.04 in 2013. 

                   Teaopias lower store productivity offers 
                   opportunity for revenue and EPS upside. Teaopia 
                   currently generates $435K in revenue per store vs. 
                   Teavanas average $913K per store. Teavana expects 
                   to close this revenue productivity gap over time.  

                   Teaopias similarities to Teavana should make the 
                   transition easy. Teaopia offers a similar product mix in 
                   a similar footprint (~900 sqft) and store layout (including 
                   a wall of tea). TEA expects minimal capital requirements 
                   and estimates spending ~$25K per store to rebrand 
                   them under the Teavana moniker compared to 
                   Teavanas typical $200$250K new store investment.  

                   Our analysis demonstrates the Teaopia acquisition 
                   has more EPS upside than if the company had 
                   bought back shares. We conducted an alternative 
                   use-of-cash analysis (share buyback) to benchmark the 
                   Teaopia acquisition. We found that the acquisition 
                   compares favorably with 3c4c of 2013 accretion vs. 3c 
                   for $26.9M in share buybacks. Increasing the store base 
                   by ~30% should also give Teavana additional leverage 
                   on infrastructure costs and allow the company to benefit 
                   from further scale as it makes additional system 
                   investments like CRM.                                           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                                                                                   companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                   We believe shares are currently appropriately               a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                   priced and maintain our Equal-weight. 3c-4c 2013                have a conflict of interest that could affect the

                   accretion from the acquisition at the current 22.7x P/E         should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a 
                   on our 2013 numbers suggests $0.68-$0.91 of share               single factor in making their investment decision.

The per store economics of the acquisition are not as                •  Financial risk  Teavanas use of cash balance to fund the 
favorable as new stores, but still generate robust 34% cash                                    acquisition could reduce its future financial flexibility should 
on cash returns. The $26.9M transaction cost translates to an                                  anything unexpected happen during the companys normal 
$585K acquisition cost per store. Adding $25K per store in                                     course of operations.  
rebranding costs brings the total cost per store to $610K, which 
does not compare favorably with $200$250K net cash                  •  Teaopia may be overstored - Additionally, Teaopia may be 
investments for the typical Teavana store. We assume that                                      oversaturated in Canada with 46 stores. The US currently 
Teaopia stores could perform at the high end of the new store                                  has a population of ~315M which supports approximately

                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO

                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

                                                     Teavana Holdings, Inc.'s (TEA-NYSE) 4Q results were strong, but had a few

                                                     1Q12 store comps may be hovering near flat. Comp volatility has occurred to others in

           3Q           $0.02     $0.03       --     to a concept nearing saturation. Second, high comps have historically correlated with
           4Q           $0.32     $0.42       --     premium multiples. On the former, we think that Teavana's comps are less indicative
               Prior    $0.31     $0.40       --     of a saturation point; geographic proximity of new stores to existing stores has not
           YEAR         $0.46     $0.59     $0.78    materially changed. Moreover, the recent acceleration of store openings (54 in 2011
               Prior    $0.45     $0.59     $0.79    alone) places some pressure on comp as stores entering the comp base lap the grand
           First Call     --    $0.64E     $0.78E    opening periods. A higher multiple may necessitate accelerating store comps. We also
                                                     take a quick look at valuation within the framework of operating metrics ± see Exhibit 1.

                                                     Growth remains strong. We look at two other drivers of top-line growth: e-commerce
                                                     and new stores. E-commerce growth was a healthy 55% in the 4Q, and drove 420
                                                     bps of total comp. There is incremental opportunity here as online still only represents
                                                     7.6% of total FY11 sales (goal of 10% by 2015). The Company also opened 50 stores
                                                     in 2011, which makes it one of the fastest growing retailers in our coverage. We see
                                                     few reasons why both of the aforementioned should slow in the near to medium term.

                                                     Timing considerations. Store openings will be focused toward the end of 1-3Q,
                                                     which drives higher pre-opening absorption without corresponding revenue. This helps
                                                     capitalize on the 4Q opportunity, but will make it more difficult to externally calculate
                                                     new store productivity.

4Q wrap. TEA posted a 4Q EPS of $0.32, above KBCM and consensus estimates of $0.31. Sales increased 33.6% year-over-year
to $68.4 million and comps were up 8.6% (ex. e-commerce up 4.4%). Inventories increased 51.7% year-over-year. Gross margin
declined -202 bps year-over-year to 65.6%, driven by increased sales of lower-margin, non-tea merchandise. SG&A as a percentage
of sales levered 67 bps to 32.2% and SG&A dollars rose 30.9% to $22.0 million. The Company opened four new stores in 4Q11 and
ended the quarter with 200 stores. Management guided 1Q12 EPS of $0.09-$0.10 and FY12 EPS of $0.58-$0.61.

VALUATION
At 32.9x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.0x 2012 PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high-growth retailer. We think the
Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new store
economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average of 31.9x 2012
P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 15.8x 2012 EV/EBITDA compared to 13.2x
EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We maintain our $28 price target, which implies a 47.4x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our upside price target include but are not limited to the
following: ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, and retention of senior
management.

         LOOKING FORWARD 
         Long-term operating margin opportunity. Looking forward, we expect SG&A rate to de-leverage in 1H12, which will be offset 
         on an annual basis by leverage in 2H12. Additionally, gross margin is expected to remain flat in FY12, resulting in a flat operating 
         margin. Looking beyond 2012, we believe gross margin will expand as stores reach maturity and, in the long term, operating 
         margin to expand.  
          
                Expect 200-300 bps of SG&A de-leverage in 1H12. SG&A de-leverage in 1H12 will be the result of comparing the 
                  current company infrastructure to pre-IPO operations. The Company expects to leverage SG&A in 2H12  (mostly in 
                  4Q12) to offset most of the de-leverage from 1H12. 
                Relatively flat gross margin and operating margin. Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year in 
                  FY12  due  to  the  anniversary  of  direct  sourcing  benefits.  Additionally,  a  significant  portion  of  stores  have  recently 
                  opened within the past two years and are operating at lower gross margins. Coupled with a flat SG&A rate for FY12, 
                  operating margins should remain flat year-over-year. 
                Store penetration of high-traffic, domestic malls. There seems to be some runway in store penetration given that 
                  approximately 50 A-mall locations will remain untouched at the end of 2012. With 60 planned store openings including 
                  the first stores outside of the United States, store count should grow to 260 by the end of the year.  
          
         THE KBCM LAUNDRY LIST 
          
                      4Q11 EPS of $0.32 was above KBCM and consensus estimate of $0.31.  
                       
                       
                      Gross margin declined 202 bps to 65.6% and operating margin declined 141 bps to 31.0%. 
                       
                          
                      Inventory levels up 51.7% year-over-year, well above sales growth of 33.6% year-over-year.

                    300-500 Teavana stores domestically (see analysis on 
                    pages 3-4). TEA plans to open 60 stores in 2012 and 
                    reach 500 stores by 2015.  

                    We monitor essential store productivity metrics for 
                    signs of deterioration. Positive 4Q store transactions 
                    (ex e-com and ex-bev) reversed prior negative trends. 
                    However, we do not assume this trend will continue into 
                    2012. Given TEAs early stage growth, we should expect 
                    strong customer acquisition evidenced by transaction 
                    growth and robust comps.

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

                  continue given that TEA is in the early stage of growth 
                  and should be rapidly acquiring new customers. 

                  Store openings drive growth. Tracking ahead of 
                  schedule, TEA ended the year with 200 stores and 
                  announced plans to increase store count 30% with an 
                  additional 60 stores in 2012. Our store penetration 
                  analysis shows a higher mix of weak and transitional 
                  malls, which has increased from 20% to 23% of the total 
                  store base, which would be expected as the concept 
                  expands. 

                  Inventory/sqft is up 9.7% and should moderate in 
                  2012. After two quarters of mid-20s increases in 
                  inventory/sqft, the company should continue to lower 
                  inventory levels after seeing increases from its direct 
                  sourcing initiative, planning holiday inventory, and taking 
                  early shipments to benefit from lower costs. 

                  Management gives tempered 2012 guidance. Q1                     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                  guidance calls for 18-20 new store and sales between            companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                  $44 to $45M on +L-MSD comps and EPS range of $0.09              a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                  to $0.10. FY2012 EPS should grow +2532% to                     have a conflict of interest that could affect the 
                                                                                  objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors 
                  $0.58$0.61 on revenues growing +24-28% to                      should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

BUY, Price Target: $21.00      from $18.00
2012: $1.10  from $1.05,  2013: $1.25  from $1.20
Cost Plus, Inc. (CPWM-NASDAQ) reported 4Q11 EPS that surpassed expectations, even after its January 5 positive
holiday sales update. Strong momentum has continued through March, and we believe CPWM is capitalizing on
an ongoing recovery in home related spending. Management issued 1Q and 2012 guidance above our Street-high
estimate, both of which we believe could prove conservative if housing and employment recover. We continue to
see CPWM as a compelling small cap stock with significant growth opportunity, that is a potential takeout target,
generates meaningful free cash flow, and trades at an attractive, discount-to-its-peers valuation. We reiterate our
BUY rating and are raising our price target to $21 from $18.

Strong 4Q EPS Above Consensus and Well Above Original Guidance. CPWM reported 4Q11 EPS from continuing
operations of $1.56. Results were above our estimate of $1.51 and consensus of $1.50. Original guidance for the quarter
had been $1.40-$1.48, and management noted on its January 5 update that EPS was expected to meet or exceed the high
end of this range. Going into the results, the range of estimates on the Street was $1.49-$1.51. EBITDA for the quarter was
$51.3 million, which was above managements original guidance of $45 million-$48 million. Reported 4Q11 EPS was $1.55,
which included $0.01 from discontinued operations from closed stores.

Solid Comp Growth Continues. Comps in the 4Q increased 7.6% vs. our estimate of 7.0%. Comps accelerated slightly
in January following the 7.4% comp posted for the nine-week holiday season, which CPWM pre-released on January 5.
Comps for the quarter exceeded original guidance of 4-6%. On a same store basis, customer count for the quarter increased
3.4% and average ticket increased 4.1%. Comps accelerated on a one-, two-, and three-year rate. As a result, total sales for
the quarter increased 6.7% to $364.3 million, which was above our estimate of a 6.0% increase as well as managements
original guidance of a 4-5% increase (to $354 million-$360 million). On a trailing twelve-month basis, CPWM has generated
sales per square foot of $231, up from $218 in 2010. Management expects to generate $243 in sales per square foot in
2012, and ultimately believes a return to $270 is achievable. During the year, CPWM generated e-commerce sales of $26
million, an increase of over 50%, and management believes it can grow e-commerce sales to $100 million over three to five
years. Looking ahead, management noted that the sales momentum has continued into the 1Q of 2012, and it continues to
expect a balance of traffic and ticket gains. With an improving housing and employment backdrop, we continue to believe
the home furnishing sector is positioned for multiple years of ongoing recovery.
Gross Margin Strong; Comp Drives SG&A Leverage. Gross margin increased 126 basis points to 34.3% (vs. our estimate
of 34.2% and managements original guidance of 34.1-34.2%) driven by higher merchandise margins and to a lesser extent
lower occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. SG&A leveraged 84 basis points to 22.6% (vs. our 22.9% estimate) due to
higher sales. As a result, operating margin increased 220 basis points to 11.7%, which was better than our 11.2% estimate.
Looking ahead, management plans to drive gross margin improvement in all four quarters in 2012. Gross margin expansion
is expected to come from modestly improved merchandise margin as well as leverage of fixed occupancy costs. Additionally,
management expects to continue to leverage SG&A expense in 2012, particularly in the 13-week 4Q.

Balance Sheet Continues to Improve; Debt-Free at Year-End. CPWMs cash balance increased 118% to $5.9 million.
Management reached its goal of becoming debt-free by year-end (down from $25.4 million at year-end 2010). A superficial
analysis of the balance sheet (or a screen on FactSet or Bloomberg) also includes $112 million in capitalized leases of two
distribution centers; however, we exclude these items from our calculations. The Company also noted that it expects to utilize
some of its $37 million in NOLs next year, although it has not factored this into its 2012 guidance.

March 23, 2012                                                                              Morning Summary

Management Provides Strong 1Q12 and Full-Year 2012 Guidance. Management initiated 2012 EPS guidance of $1.07-
$1.12 (representing an increase of 41-48% year-over-year). This was above the consensus of $1.04 and our Street-high
estimate of $1.05. On a 52-week vs. 52-week basis management expects EPS of $0.97-$1.02 (representing an increase
                                                                                                              rd
of 28- 34% year-over-year). Sales for the year are expected to increase 4-14%. Management noted that the 53  week
is expected to add $16 million or 2% to sales, and $0.10 to EPS. Comps are expected to increase 5-6%. Management
anticipates  full-year  gross  margin  to  increase  50-60  basis  points  with  10-20  basis  points  from  merchandise  margins.
Additionally, CPWM expects to open 5-10 stores in existing markets (of which eight leases have been signed). For the 1Q,
management expects EPS of a loss of $0.07 to a loss of $0.03. Management expects sales growth of 5-7% in the quarter
with comps increasing 6-8%. 1Q gross margin is expected to improve by 10-20 basis points.

Valuation Compelling When Debt Adjusted. At face value, based on a screening of FactSet or Bloomberg, CPWM appears
to be trading at an EV/EBITDA of 7.4x the 2012 consensus estimate. The Enterprise Value calculation for these services
includes over $112 million in capitalized lease liabilities related to the sale-leaseback of two distribution centers in 2006.
Excluding this normal operating expense line item, debt is eliminated and Enterprise Value is reduced by 23%. As part of this
adjustment, we include $8.5 million in financing expense associated with the capitalized leases in our EBITDA estimates.
When making the above adjustments, shares of CPWM trade at EV/EBITDA multiples of 6.5x and 5.9x our 2012 and 2013
estimates, respectively, significantly below the valuation that appears on FactSet/Bloomberg and compares to the current
home furnishings average of 7.0x.

Raising Estimates. Based on continued strong momentum, we are raising our 1Q EPS estimate to a loss of $0.06 from a
loss of $0.08. Our 2Q estimate goes to a loss of $0.26 from a loss of $0.22 and our 3Q estimate goes to a loss of $0.30
from a loss of $0.28. For the 4Q, our estimate goes to $1.68 from $1.61. As such, our full-year 2012 estimate goes to $1.10
from $1.05. We are also raising our 2013 estimate to $1.25 from $1.20.

Valuation
Shares of CPWM trade at 14.6x and 12.8x our 2012 and 2013 EPS estimates of $1.10 and $1.25, respectively. On an
EV/EBITDA basis, after removing the $112 million in long-term debt from CPWMs Enterprise Value and removing the $8
million of capital lease interest expense from EBITDA (both as discussed above), shares of CPWM trade at 6.5x and 5.9x
our 2012 and 2013 estimates, respectively. Shares also trade at an EV/Sales (when making the above EV adjustments) of
0.4x and 0.3x our 2012 and 2013 estimates, respectively. Our new 12-month price target of $21 is based on 17x our new
2013 EPS estimate of $1.25. Our previous 12-month price target of $18 is based on 15x our previous 2013 EPS estimate.
This compares to the 16x average for our Home Furnishings coverage. We believe a premium is warranted given the strong
earnings growth and our increased confidence that the Company will return to peak sales per square foot. We maintain our
BUY rating at this time.
Risks
Risks that could impede the stock from reaching our price target include:
l
  Mass merchants could take a more aggressive approach within home furnishings than we currently anticipate.
l
  Consumer spending and/or the housing market could slow.
l
  Inflationary pressures.
l
  Additional regulation on the sale of alcohol.

We are increasing our 2012E from $2.85 to $2.89; however, we are lowering our 1Q12E (March) from $0.52 to $0.49 (vs.
$0.46 in 1Q11) and are therefore adopting a bit more of a near-term cautious stance on FELE shares. Our initial 2013E is
set at $3.18. Our 2012E revision reflects our view that FELE will benefit from about $0.05-$0.07 of accretion from its recent
acquisition of a majority equity stake in Pioneer Pump Holdings, Inc. partially offset by more cautious core growth and margin
assumptions within its Water Systems and Fueling Systems segments  particularly early on in 2012. We are maintaining our
view that FELE shares are near fair valuation, although we believe there could be some modest potential downside risk to
the stock near term as we now shift our 1Q estimate to a below consensus view. We envision demand headwinds in Europe
impacting both its Water and Fueling businesses, bearing in mind that the 1Q is already typically the seasonally weakest
quarter of the year for the Company. Based on recent conversations with our channel contacts, we believe market conditions
in North America are relatively in line with our prior expectations, while severe drought conditions are likely driving stronger
demand in Brazil and other parts of South America. Crop prices, farm incomes and planted acreage remain favorable for
agriculture-related demand globally; however, weather will be a key factor (as always), and FELE faces difficult year-over-
year comparisons in this portion if its business. At this time last year, our channel conversations confirmed that distributors
were very bullish on irrigation markets, which was reflected by earlier than normal purchases of submersible motors and
pumps during 1Q11 in anticipation of a robust start to the season. We believe this is also a contributing factor to challenging
comparisons in this end market. Below, we discuss these and other related items in more detail.
1. Geographic Views/End Markets/Volume  We believe about 15% of consolidated company sales are generated in
Western Europe (similar percentage of sales for both Water and Fueling) and, as we have discussed previously, we would
not be surprised if customers continued to rationalize inventory and/or defer making capital investments given the uncertain
macro environment in that region and general lack of new construction activity. FELE experienced a mid to high single-digit
organic sales decline in EMENA (Europe, Middle East, Northern Africa) during 2H11, and we would not be surprised to
witness a similar core volume drop during 1Q12. As FELE previously indicated, it expects higher raw material costs (from
the expiration of fixed cost supply contracts and the subsequent supplier price increases) to weigh on operating margins in
EMENA once again in the 1Q. The Company has implemented price increases over the last several months, which it believes
will largely close this margin gap in the 2Q and beyond vs. easier raw material cost comparisons (as a percentage of sales
basis), but it will likely still be somewhat of a headwind in the 1Q.

Based on our channel conversations over the last several days, it appears that demand among water systems distributors in
North America is relatively in line with our expectations to start the year. Some of our contacts indicated that mild temperatures
may be pulling forward some project activity, though new residential construction markets clearly remain sluggish and are a
consistent source of caution among our contacts. Drought conditions continue to drive strong demand in the southwest United
States (i.e., Texas and New Mexico), though growth rates have moderated vs. difficult year-over-year comparisons, and recent
precipitation has eased the strain on water tables in some regions. In general, demand is mixed across other regions of the
United States, though customers appear to be maintaining a cautiously optimistic view on 2012 ahead of the peak growing

March 23, 2012                                                                                 Morning Summary

and construction season. While agriculture-related demand tends to be volatile based on weather conditions (i.e., dry is better
than wet) in the key crop producing regions and thus difficult to predict, throughout 2012 FELE faces a difficult comparison
in this business (agriculture/irrigation volumes were estimated to increase in the 20-30% range each quarter in 2011), which
tends to carry more attractive margins than the base residential business. The Companys agriculture-related business
(e.g., its larger diameter, higher HP motors used in irrigation applications) grew significantly in 2011, as farmers invested in
irrigation systems to drive up crop yields, in addition to replacing motors that failed under harsh operating conditions (i.e.,
longer cycle times, deeper well sets and more sand infiltration as water tables dropped). In 2011, in anticipation of healthy
crop prices and strong end user demand, distributors were more aggressive with adding preseason stock in 1Q11 than
normal and now appear to have reverted back to a more conservative posture thus far in 2012.

Elsewhere, reports of severe drought conditions in South America bode well for FELEs agriculture-related business in
developing regions, led by Brazil and parts of Central America, noting that Brazil is the worlds largest soybean producer and
crop prices remain near record highs. Overall, construction, agriculture, mining and general industrial markets continue to
appear solid in developing regions despite some pockets of softness such as North and sub-Saharan Africa.

2. Pricing and Channel Inventory  Beginning in late 4Q11 and throughout 1Q12, FELE implemented price increases
(about 3-4% on average) across almost all product lines and geographies in both its Water and Fueling businesses. While the
full benefit of these pricing actions will not likely be realized until 2Q12, conversations with our distributor contacts suggest
that the price increases in North America have been followed by other industry participants and are sticking. Quarter-end
discounting appears to be very minimal at this time. Inventory levels remain relatively lean in North America, which, following
the last recession, appears to be a more normalized practice as distributors generally seek to risk less capital.

3. Acquisition of Pioneer Pump Holdings, Inc.  On March 7th, FELE announced that it has acquired a 70% equity stake
(in total) in Pioneer Pump Holdings, Inc. (PPH) over the course of two separate transactions. PPH is a leading manufacturer
of large, engine-driven centrifugal pumps used for dewatering in oil and gas, municipal, construction and mining applications.
FELE had previously purchased a 35% stake in Pioneer Pump, Inc. (one of two subsidiaries fully owned by PPH) in 2005.
PPH had total sales of $70 million in 2011 and will now be consolidated into FELEs income statement vs. being accounted
for under the equity method. Terms were not disclosed; however, based on historical acquisitions in the Water Systems
segment and our related initial assessment of purchase price and profitability, we would roughly estimate that FELE paid
around $50 million for the increased stake (which would be in line with its historical acquisition target of roughly 6-8x 2012
EBITDA), and it could be about $0.05-$0.07 accretive this year, excluding purchase accounting adjustments and a one-time
book gain (or "write-up") of $0.33-$0.37 anticipated in 1Q12 related to its initial equity investment. Our estimates exclude
such non-recurring items.

4. In Addition to Difficult Comps in Its Profitable Agriculture-Related Business, FELE Benefited from Several Other
Dynamics in 2011 that May Not Re-occur in 2012  While it is difficult to quantify the exact magnitude, conversations
with some of our distributor contacts last year appeared to support our view that FELE likely benefited from the collateral
impact of the natural disasters in Japan, as one of its primary, large motor competitors (Hitachi) dealt with manufacturing
disruptions during the critical spring/summer selling season last year. We also believe that another of its primary competitors
(Grundfos) was negatively impacted by a quality-related recall on some of its larger diameter motors, which may have also
allowed FELE to take additional share during 2011, not all of which is apt to recur in 2012.
We are maintaining our HOLD rating on FELE shares as we believe the stock is near fair valuation. As we look forward into
2012, we believe that FELE could face several headwinds including difficult comparisons in its North American agriculture-
related business, potential negative mix shift in fueling (i.e., more emerging market revenue), raw material-related cost
headwinds in component purchases (which are expected to carry into 1H12) and weak demand in Europe (organic sales
declined 7% in 3Q11 and 6% in 4Q11). However, underlying momentum within the Americas appears solid, driven by
residential replacement, light commercial, general industrial and irrigation markets  noting that in each of these markets,
FELE likely picked up some additional market share in 2011. FELEs pricing actions have been communicated to the
marketplace, with varying dates of implementation depending upon the region; however, the magnitude is in the range of
3-4% and should be fully in place during 2Q12.

Considering these factors, while we see some potential for some level of correction in the shares if 1Q results end up being
a bit less robust than some may be anticipating, the longer term risk-reward appears fairly balanced at this time, and we
are maintaining our HOLD rating on FELE shares. Given our balanced view on the stock, we recognize that longer term
investors may be attracted to FELE as a potential "derivative play" on a rebound in new construction demand, particularly
residential markets in developed countries, potential strength in agriculture markets and an underleveraged balance sheet.

Valuation
At current levels, FELE shares sell at 8.9x and 8.1x EV/EBITDA based on our 2012 and 2013 EBITDA estimates (and
adjusted for Pioneer), compared to its historical range of about 8-11x, and vs. its recent trough of about 6.0x. On a P/E basis,
FELE shares sell at 17.2x and 15.6x our 2012E and 2013E, respectively, vs. a normalized historical range of about 15-20x.
Risks
Risk factors include adverse weather (unseasonably wet), raw material inflation and persistent softness in new home builds.

HOLD, Price Target: NA
2012: $4.50  from $4.85,  2013: $5.85  from $5.80
The winter season for Compass Minerals International, Inc. (CMP-NYSE) deicing salt business is likely down
considerably compared to last year as a result of the generally mild weather throughout the Great Lakes region
in 1Q12. Given this we expect deicing volumes to be lower than we initially anticipated in early February and we
are cutting our deicing volume estimate to down 18% (previously -10%) vs. last year. Total earnings for 1Q12 and
FY12 should be down year-over-year due to the effects of unfavorable weather patterns for both salt and SOP.
The Specialty Fertilizer segment should be helped by relatively stable MOP prices supporting SOP pricing. CMP
is positioned for much improved operating results in 2013 assuming average weather conditions as operating
improvement initiatives are completed and expansion projects come on-line. However, due to the above mentioned
weather issues, we are lowering our full-year 2012 EPS estimate to $4.50 (from $4.85) and keeping our HOLD rating.

l
  Weather Woes Continue: Mild winter weather throughout CMPs distribution area should create a considerable headwind
  to deicing salt volumes. To date, we estimate 72 snow event days in key cities in CMPs core region vs. 153 in 1Q11.
l
  Goderich: We suspect that the Goderich mine is still running at below average utilization levels, but should be fully
  operational by 2H12 allowing CMP to participate in market growth opportunities in 2013.
l
  Stable SOP Prices: Stability in MOP pricing will help keep SOP price stable as well, in our opinion. Phase 1 of CMPs
  SOP expansion phase should be completed this year and help to grow SOP earnings in 2013.
l
  Estimate Changes: Based on the continued mild winter weather season and lower deicing volumes we are adjusting our
  1Q12 and 2012 EPS estimates down to $1.47 (previously $1.75) and $4.50 (previously $4.85), respectively.

Valuation
CMP has traded in an average low to high EV/EBITDA multiple range of 7.4-10.1x and an average low to high P/E range
of 11.9-18.2x over the past seven years. The stock is currently trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.7x and a P/E multiple
of 15.5x on our estimated 2012 outlook. CMP has traded at a low to high EV/Sales of 1.8-2.5x over the past seven years
and is currently trading at 2.4x. We rate shares of CMP HOLD.
Risks
Key risks include, but are not limited to: weather conditions impacting crop or highway deicing markets; a sustained downturn
in farmer economics; commodity potash pricing volatility; energy, raw material and/or transportation cost volatility; and
environmental, regulatory and/or legal issues.

BUY, Price Target: $20.00
2012: $1.99,  2013: $2.38
Following meetings with management at the Mid-America Truck, we continue to view Dana Holding Corporation
(DAN-NYSE) as a BUY and reiterate our $20 price target based on the belief that: 1) revenue is well diversified
across multiple end markets and regions, the majority of which likely provide a cyclical tailwind going forward;
2) restructuring appears roughly complete and new CEO Roger Wood is now shifting gears to a BorgWarner like
focus on organic revenue growth (i.e., increased market share, penetration, and content per vehicle); 3) Company
execution drives EBITDA margin improvements and while we are currently below its 2013 target of 12%, it leaves
some upside to our current estimates; and 4) the Company's balance sheet remains solid and free cash flow going
forward is likely used for bolt-on acquisitions, debt and unfunded pension paydowns, and further shareholder
friendly actions in addition to its current dividend. We are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA estimate at $857 million
(First Call $849 million) for 2012 and $957 million (First Call $959 million) for 2013. While we believe that adjusted
EBITDA vs. diluted adjusted EPS is a better proxy for results, due primarily to its diluted adjusted EPS guidance,
we are maintaining our earnings estimates at $1.99 for 2012 (First Call $1.91) and an adjusted EPS estimate of $2.38
(First Call $2.28) for 2013.

Mid-America Truck Show and ACT Seminar Takeaways: We had the opportunity to attend both the Mid America Truck
Show and a two day ACT seminar and came away incrementally encouraged by the outlook for Commercial Vehicle
production for both North America as well as other regions. While January and February new orders were somewhat
weaker than previous months, it appears largely driven by the impact of accelerated depreciation, which ended in 2011. The
fundamentals still remain very robust driven by record high vehicle age, increasing used truck prices, greater availability of
financing, as well as a macro recovery driving freight demand. Suppliers, OEMs, and industry experts remain very optimistic
on 2012 North American Class 8 production with the range of expectations now settling in the range of 290,000-300,000,
in line with our estimate of 300,000. Additionally, we expect several more years of gradual recovery in commercial vehicle
production followed by a plateo around the 2014 timeframe. In Europe, the overall assessment appears to be that production
schedules have stabilized and things do not look to be getting any worse. Brazil experienced a very slow start to the year,
with production virtually at zero in January; however, sentiment remains positive and there is an expectation of a ramp as
we head into 2Q12.
Valuation

On a P/E basis, our $20 price target is 8.4x our 2013 EPS estimate of $2.38. On a P/E basis, DAN is trading 6.7x our
2013 EPS estimate of $2.38. DAN has traded at an average 12-month forward P/E of 13.5x. On an EV/Sales basis, DAN
is currently trading at a 0.36x our 2013 sales estimate of $8.7 billion. During 2010-2011, DAN has traded at an average
EV/Sales ratio of 0.38x.
Risks

The largest risk that could impede the stock from achieving our price target is a decline in global vehicle production.

HOLD, Price Target: NA
2012: $1.12,  2013: $1.33
Following our meeting with management at the Mid-America Truck Show, we reiterate our view on Meritor, Inc.
(MTOR-NYSE) as a near-term trading opportunity based on our belief that: 1) the Company recently reiterated
guidance for the third time, reflecting confidence in near-term outlook and execution; 2) the MTOR discount to
its EBITDA guidance reflected in Street estimates could quickly become unwound; 3) current commercial vehicle
production expectations are for a more gradual ramp vs. the 2011 accelerated recovery and management seems
comfortable with its current capacity and its ability to meet customer demand profitably; 4) multiple levers for
EBITDA margin improvement appear complete, and benefits should become evident when the Company reports
2Q12 results; 5) management stated that steel costs appear to have plateaued and in combination with cost
recoveries, are likely a tailwind over the near term; and 5) the combination of the above could drive shorter-term
sentiment improvement in a beaten down stock; however, we view the opportunity as a potential near-term trade
vs. a longer-term BUY and are maintaining our HOLD rating until we see several consistent quarters of execution.
We are leaving our earnings estimates unchanged at $1.12 (First Call consensus $1.17) for 2012 and $1.33 (First
Call consensus $1.63) for 2013.

BUY, Price Target: $28.00
2011: $0.45,  2012: $0.59
Teavana Holdings, Inc. (TEA-NYSE) has a strong combination of a distinctive store environment, attractive secular
trends and a visible gross margin tail  we initiate with a BUY rating. The Companys 19% operating margin is one
of the highest in our coverage universe. We believe the Company has continued margin expansion opportunity as
the penetration of loose tea increases from store maturation. Also, our proprietary field work points to a unique
performance management and compensation model; we think this helps institutionalize the highly consultative
nature of the business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the stores theater differentiates it from other mall-
based retailers, and we think evokes the best from our lifestyle-focused retailers (including lululemon athletica inc.
and Zumiez Inc.). We think this will drive 25%+ EPS growth for the next three to five years.
We establish a price target of $28, which implies a 47.1x P/E and a 1.2x PEG based on our 2012 estimates. This
compares to a 30.1x 2012E P/E and 1.5x 2012E PEG for the high growth retail peer group.

The Company has a highly consultative sales force and a distinct store environment. Our proprietary field work points
to an in-store operations model that combines many of the best elements of our other covered companies. Employees have
rigorous goal setting, and the Company has intensive training. Sales incentives drive a consultative environment similar to
Nordstrom and Buckle. A unique store environment that stimulates the senses evokes lululemon athletica. We think these
attributes that differentiate the store experience are important in the age of internet retailing.

TEA has a leading position in the secularly attractive specialty tea market. Eighty-five percent of TEAs products are
blends, which we think adds an element of stickiness to the consumer offer. Despite the ubiquity of tea, the Company does not
have a national specialty retail competitor that offers high quality loose tea. Our analysis indicates that Teavana is generally
the only loose tea retailer located in its shopping centers.

Store operating metrics are some of the strongest in our coverage and loose tea penetration provides a gross
margin tail. The Company has roughly $1,000 in sales PSF, one of the highest in our coverage universe. Moreover, we view
its 60% gross margin as defensible given a positive tailwind from higher penetration of loose tea (600-800+ bps maturation
mix benefit). The Company continues to see strong performance from its most recent store vintages, and we believe that
store performance from smaller markets will remain strong.

Valuation
At 37.8x 2012E P/E, 4.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.2x 2012E PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high growth retailer. The
stock is up over 32% from its $17 IPO price, compared to an 8% gain in the S&P 500 Index over the same time period. We
think the Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program,
strong new store economics and multi-year runway for gross margin expansion compared to the specialty retail peer group.
Thus, we think TEA deserves to trade at a premium to the high growth retail peer group averages of 30.1x 2012E P/E, 3.0x
2012E EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012E PEG. We establish a $28 price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59 2012
EPS estimate. We think the multiple is fair given the Companys earnings profile and compelling unit growth opportunity.
Risks
Risks that could impede the stock from achieving our price target:
TEA is moving into smaller markets. The Company has 196 stores, and a number of new stores will be opened in shopping
malls with lower average sales per square foot than the malls in which the Company currently has a presence. New stores

will generally operate at lower gross margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, compared to mature
stores. Our estimates could be at risk if the Company is unable to identify suitable locations to open new stores, obtain
favorable lease terms, attract customers, hire and retain personnel, and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow to support
expansion.

While we see few national competitors, the tea market remains highly competitive. The U.S. tea market remains highly
fragmented with low barriers to entry. Our estimates could be at risk if the Company is unable to provide a differentiated,
superior customer experience and attract more business than its regional and local competitors.

Management, particularly founder and CEO Andrew Mack, has been instrumental in the development of the concept;
continued involvement is a key area of our investment thesis. Having founded the Company in 1997, CEO Andrew
Mack has hired experienced senior managers to implement the Companys long-term growth strategy. The potential sudden
departure of key management executives would likely impact the stock price in a significant manner, in our opinion.

VALUATION
At 37.8x 2012E P/E, 4.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.2x 2012E PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high growth retailer. The stock is up
over 32% from its $17 IPO price, compared to an 8% gain in the S&P 500 Index over the same time period. We think the Company can
sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program, strong new store economics and
multi-year runway for gross margin expansion compared to the specialty retail peer group. Thus, we think TEA deserves to trade at a
premium to the high growth retail peer group averages of 30.1x 2012E P/E, 3.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012E PEG. We establish
a $28 price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate. We think the multiple is fair given the Company's
earnings profile and compelling unit growth opportunity.

RISKS
Risks that could impede the stock from achieving our price target:
TEA is moving into smaller markets. The Company has 196 stores, and a number of new stores will be opened in shopping malls with
lower average sales per square foot than the malls in which the Company currently has a presence. New stores will generally operate
at lower gross margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, compared to mature stores. Our estimates could be
at risk if the Company is unable to identify suitable locations to open new stores, obtain favorable lease terms, attract customers, hire
and retain personnel, and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow to support expansion.

While we see few national competitors, the tea market remains highly competitive. The U.S. tea market remains highly fragmented
with low barriers to entry. Our estimates could be at risk if the Company is unable to provide a differentiated, superior customer
experience and attract more business than its regional and local competitors.

Management,  particularly  founder  and  CEO  Andrew  Mack,  has  been  instrumental  in  the  development  of  the  concept;
continued involvement is a key area of our investment thesis. Having founded the Company in 1997, CEO Andrew Mack has
hired experienced senior managers to implement the Company's long-term growth strategy. The potential sudden departure of key
management executives would likely impact the stock price in a significant manner, in our opinion.

   P/E 69.7x 49.6x 37.8x                    our 2012 estimates. This compares to a  30.1x 2012E P/E and 1.3x 2012E PEG for the

                                            KEY INVESTMENT POINTS 
                                            The Company has a highly consultative sales force and a distinct store 
                                            environment.  Our proprietary field work points to an in-store operations model that 
                                            combines many of the best elements of our  other covered compan ies. Employees have 
                                            rigorous goal setting, and the Company has in tensive training. Sales incentives drive a 
                                            consultative environment similar to Nordstrom and Buckle. A unique store environment 
                                            that stimulates the s enses evokes lululemon athletica.  We think these attributes that 
                                            differentiate the store experience are important in the age of internet retailing.   
                                             
                                            Teavana has a leading position in the secu     larly attractive specialty tea market. 
                                            Eighty-five percent of Teavanas products are blends, which we think adds an element of 
                                            stickiness to the consumer offer. Despite the ubiquity of tea, the Company does not have 
                                            a national specialty retail com  petitor that offers high qua  lity loose tea. Our analysis 
                                            indicates that Teavana is generally the only   loose tea retailer located in its shopping 
                                            centers.  
                                             
                                            Store operating metrics are some of the strongest in our coverage and loose tea 
                                            penetration provides a gross margin tail.  The Company has roughly $1,000 in sales 
                                            PSF, one of the highest in our coverage universe. Moreover, we view its 60% gross 
                                            margin as defensible given a positive tailwind  from higher penetration of loose tea (600-
                                            800+ bps maturation mix benefit). The Co mpany continues to see strong performance 
                                            from its most recent store vintages, and we  believe that store performance from smaller 
                                            markets will remain strong.

                                    VALUATION 
                                    At 37.5x 2012E P/E, 4.0x 2012E EV/Sales and  1.2x 2012E PEG, valuation is reasonable for a 
                                    high growth retailer. The stock is up over 32% from its $17 IPO price, compared to an 8% gain in 
                                    the S&P 500 Index over the same   time period. We think the Comp any can sustain accelerating 
                                    earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive  new store opening program, strong new store 
                                    economics and multi-year runway for gross margin expansion compared to the specialty retail peer 
                                    group. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the high growth retail peer group 
                                    averages of 30.1x 2012E P/E,  3.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012E PEG. We establish a $28 
                                    price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate. We think the 
                                    multiple is fair given the Companys earnings profile and compelling unit growth opportunity.

                                                        tea market remains highly fragmented with low barri  ers to entry. Our estimate s could be at risk if 
                                                        the Company is unable to provide a differentiated,  superior customer experience and attract more 
                                                        business than its regional and local competitors.  
                                                         
                                                        Management, particularly founder and CEO Andrew Mack, has been instrumental in the 
                                                        development of the concept; continued involvement is a key area of our investment thesis. 
                                                        Having founded the Company in 1997, CEO Andrew Mack has hired experienced senior managers 
                                                        to implement the Companys long-term growth st                                   rategy. The potential sudden departure of key 
                                                        management executives would likely impact the stock price in a significant manner, in our opinion.  
                                                         
                                                        EARNINGS OUTLOOK: 25%+ ANNUAL EPS GROWTH 
                                                        We think that Teavana will have 25% annual EPS                                         growth over the next three to five years. 
                                                        The Company has, in our opinion, one of the most                                    differentiated store environments in the mall. 
                                                        The Company has an ongoing operating margin expansion opportunity not only through the typical 
                                                        rent/occupancy leverage, but also via higher contribution from loose teas as stores mature. The 
                                                        Company has the ability to at least double the  current store base and should continue to post mid 
                                                        to high single-digit comps.

                                                       Gross margin expansion expected to continue despite three consecutive years of roughly 
                                                       200+ bps growth.  With the Company's move to direct sourcing fully anniversaried in the 3Q, we 
                                                       expect gross margin improvement from here to be driven by the natural sales mix shift away from 
                                                       merchandise toward higher margin loose tea as  new stores mature. With 54 new stores expected 
                                                       in 2011, 60 planned for 2012, 70 planned for 2013 and an estimated 80 openings per year through 
                                                       2015, we think there is a long runway for steady   gross margin expansion as new stores enter the 
                                                       comp base and ramp to maturity (a four-year time frame). New stores generally open with higher 
                                                       than average sales in the first few months; sales begin to normalize after the first three months. 
                                                       Upon opening, purchases of loose tea typically ma                                 ke up a little over 50% of sales; tea-related 
                                                       merchandise (such as teapots, cups, brewers, kettles, timers, spoons, trays) and beverages make 
                                                       up the remaining sales. As stores mature, customers graduate from buying teaware to replenishing 
                                                       their favorite teas and trying new blends  a mu                              ch more profitable sale. At maturity, loose tea 
                                                       purchases make up about  60% of sales. This evolution provid es a natural margin lift, given gross 
                                                       margins on tea sales typically run about 1,000 bps higher than non-tea product sales. With an 
                                                       accelerated store opening cadence over the next   four years, we expect the Company will see a 
                                                       sales mix shift benefit of about 600-800+ bps per cla ss of new stores over t he next decade. At the 
                                                       end of 2010, loose tea made up 56% of total sales.

                                  We also believe TEA's continued de-emphasis of beverage sales (as a percent of total sales) 
                                  has and will continue to positively impact gross margins.   Beverage sales have come down 
                                  dramatically from 8-10% of total sales in 1997  to 4% today. We believe beverage sales will likely 
                                  stay at this low single-digit percentage level go ing forward. We expect gross margins in 2011 to 
                                  reach a new peak, expanding by 165 bps year-over-year to 64.5%. Margins over the last four 
                                  quarters have grown significantly year-over-year (4Q10 +448 bps; 1Q11 +325 bps; 2Q11 +223 bps; 
                                  3Q11 +323 bps) as a result of the Company's     move to a direct sourcing model, which drove 
                                  improved product margins in non-tea merchandise ca tegories. In addition, gross margins benefited 
                                  slightly over the last year due to an increased sa  les mix shift toward loose tea and reduction in

                                  Look for continued SG&A investments.  We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to rise by 187 
                                  bps to 42.4% in 2011 and 82 bps to 43.2% in 2012  (following 100+ bps of year-over-year leverage 
                                  in each of the last four years) primarily due to   a significant increase in pre-opening and training 
                                  costs (driven by planned acceleration of new stor e openings over the next few years) as well as 
                                  infrastructure-related costs (including new corporate office rent, setup costs for Canada, distribution 
                                  center expansion and continued investments in IT). Moreover, we expect SG&A to be incrementally 
                                  pressured through 1H12 due to higher corporate costs associated with being a public company; 
                                  this includes additional costs for increased personnel in finance, legal and compliance, as well as 
                                  stock-based compensation.  Beginning in 2013, we expect SG&A costs to normalize, as this will be 
                                  the first year the Company fully anniversaries public company costs. 
                                   
                                  Teavana has significant opportunities in marketing and understanding customer loyalty. The 
                                  Company has been aggressively looking for a VP of Marketing for the past three to six months, and 
                                  hopes to have someone in place shortly, prior to  the anticipated launch of its CRM system in 2012. 
                                  Despite having very little customer-specific data, TEA does have a significant amount of store level 
                                  and SKU level data, which we think will be very usef ul in building a loyalty program to further drive 
                                  the average ticket and increase the number of tr ansactions (the bigger opportunity today). The 
                                  Companys ecommerce platform has been in oper      ation for four years now, which has helped 
                                  educate consumers on tea; however, this channel st ill represents a small portion of total sales (7% 
                                  as of FY10) and will likely grow at a steady   pace to 10% of the business in 2015. Though 
                                  management does not have a stated target for mark eting spend as a percent of sales, we believe 
                                  this will be a material increase in 2012 and 2013  (as the Company starts to build out the marketing 
                                  department and CRM program from nothing).

                                  We see long-term operating margin expansion opportunity.    After four consecutive years of 
                                  100-600+ bps of year-over-year expansion, we ex  pect Teavanas operating margins to contract 
                                  modestly in 2011 and 2012, before delivering expansion in 2013 and beyond, as the Company 
                                  begins to cycle its increased spending on infrastructure investments and public company costs. We 
                                  currently model an operating margin of 18.5% in  2011, and believe the Company could reach its 
                                  stated 21% operating margin goal over the next five years on a more mature business platform.

                                       INITIATION CHECKLIST = BUY 
                                       Teavana has a strong combination of a distinctive store environment, attractive secular 
                                       trends, and a visible gross margin tail  we initiate with a BUY rating.    The Companys 19% 
                                       operating margin is one of the highest in our       coverage universe. We believe the Company has 
                                       continued margin expansion opportunity as the          penetration of loose tea   increases from store 
                                       maturation. Also, our proprietary field work      points to a unique performance management and 
                                       compensation model; we think this helps institut        ionalize the highly consultative nature of the 
                                       business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, th  e stores theater differ entiates it from other 
                                       mall-based retailers, and we think evokes the best        from our lifestyle-focused retailers (including 
                                       lululemon athletica and Zumiez).

                                                     Exhibit 17: Initiation Checklist 
 
 Differentiated retail environment 
                                                       We think that Teavana has one of the most differentiated retail offerings in our 
                                                        coverage universe. The Wall of Tea adds to the theatrical element of the retail 
                                                        environment  we think it is as unique as our best-in-class retail 
                                                        environments (lululemon, Tiffany and Zumiez).   
                                                         
 Higher priced premium products 
                                                       There is a very wide product and pricing breadth, which makes the offering 
                                                        both accessible and aspirational. The premium teas are certainly a luxury 
                                                        item, but are much more affordable on a per cup basis  see Exhibit 27.  
                                                         
 Healthy living 
                                                       Tea has proven health benefits and has little or no calories.  

                                                         
 Strong management team 
                                                       We think the Teavana management team is one of the strongest in our 
                                                        coverage universe. Inside ownership, particularly by CEO Andrew Mack (56% 
                                                        holding) is very high. 
                                                         
 U.S growth 
                                               ?        The Company has at least a 500 store U.S. opportunity. However, more 
                                                        growth will come from less productive B mall locations. In addition, the 
                                                        Company has not embarked on street locations.

                                 CONSULTATIVE ENVIRONMENT 
                                 Teavana has an unusually disciplined focus on store operations.  Our field work uncovered a 
                                 very elaborate system of weekly grades for employees.  
                                  
                                 Monthly bonuses and grading instill accountability. Generally speaking, the trigger for bonus 
                                 payment, as well as the amount paid, is a func  tion of each salespersons weekly performance 
                                 grades (i.e., A, B, C, et c.) to determine the average monthly performance grade. An average 
                                 target sales/hour goal is determined each week and  is essentially a functi on of the expected run 
                                 rate of the store as compared to other stores (i.e., higher volume stores have higher sales targets). 
                                 Based upon the expected/planned sales volume for each store, a per hour sales goal is identified 
                                 each month for the respective stores salespeople.  For example, if the goal was $100/hour and the 
                                 actual average weekly sales per hour attribut  ed to a given staff member was greater than 
                                 $100/hour, then a top grade, such as an A+, would be given to that salesperson for the week. At

                                 determine if he/she will receive a monthly bonus  payout and the corresponding bonus amount. In 
                                 order to be eligible for bonus payout, the weekly performance grade average must be an A. 
                                 Additionally, if the weekly average for a given mont h is an A, a bonus is paid on only those sales 
                                 from the weeks when an A grade was achieved. 
                                  
                                 A focus on internal promotio n drives a strong culture.   The Company gives its employees 
                                 further incentive for top performance by making  internal promotion a key focus and strategy, 
                                 particularly with its aggressive new store opening  plans through 2015. Of the 50 stores opened in 
                                 2011, through 3Q11, 48 of them (or 96%) opened with general managers who were promoted from 
                                 within the Company. Management  believes that opening stores wi th internally promoted general 
                                 managers is critical, as this has historically improved consistency of service and store performance. 
                                 This 96% internal promotion rate for new stores  continues to improve; the 2011 run-rate is above 
                                 the 87% rate achieved in FY10 and 39% rate achieved in FY09.

                                     Expect new store model to remain profitable.    We believe new store openings will drive the 
                                     majority of year-over-year EPS growth for the next       four to five years, at 60-80 stores per year. 
                                     Despite the Companys high penetration in A malls across the United States, we think TEA has an 
                                     adequate amount of quality, lower  rent locations in B malls and street locations it could tap to 
                                     complete its 500-store goal by 2015. We believe this lower leverage point on occupancy expense is 
                                     key to the Companys store growth plan, which also assumes lower than historical average sales in 
                                     year one. Though the average size  of the stores opened in 2011 is about 15% higher than the 
                                     average size for stores opened in 2010 and prior,   occupancy cost as a percent of sales for the 
                                     2011 class is slightly lower than the class of 2010 and prior, and occupancy cost per gross square 
                                     foot is much lower than the class of 2010 and prio r. In addition, TEAs new store model requires a 
                                     lower amount of capital investment to open (a t $200,000-$250,000) compared to the Companys 
                                     historical average for new stores, thanks to a      lower average buildout cost and higher average 
                                     tenant allowances per new store. Despite a four-year ramp period to maturity, a new store typically 
                                     has a payback period of 18 months on its initial investment.

                                       COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 
                                       Teavana operates in a very fragmented competitive landscape. The U.S. tea market has grown 
                                       consistently in recent years, which has attrac ted numerous entrepreneurs and competitors into the 
                                       growing tea market. According to the U.S. Tea A  ssociation, the U.S. tea  market has grown at a 
                                       CAGR of 7.4% during the last 20  years. As of 2010, the  U.S. tea market was estimated to be $7.7 
                                       billion (wholesale value), which is up from $1.84  billion in 1990. However,  the U.S. tea market is 
                                       immature and competitors tend to be tea rooms,   which grew from 200 to 400 in the last decade 
                                       (source: U.S. Tea Association), coffee houses offe  ring specialty teas, and many different stand 
                                       alone tea stores, which offer a wide assortment  of tea products. Teavana currently has 196 owned 
                                       stores in the United States al  one and holds a significant market   share of the growing U.S. tea 
                                       market.  Davids Tea, a Canadian-based tea company, executes a similar strategy to Teavana with 
                                       more than 40 Canadian stores and two stores in New York City; expansion into the U.S. market 
                                       began at the end of 2011. Through  our proprietary fieldwork, we discovered that Davids Teas has 
                                       plans in place to expand to six stores in the NYC area in the very near term and has plans for 
                                       aggressive growth throughout the United States during 2012. We believe Davids Tea could quickly 
                                       become one of Teavanas more significant competitive threats in the U.S. market. 
                                        
                                       The U.S. tea market remains immature relative to other countries.  The Companys business is 
                                       highly concentrated on a single, discretionary       product category, premium loose teas and tea-
                                       related merchandise, and is dependent upon signific ant growth of the U.S.  Tea market as well as 
                                       healthy consumer spending. These discretionary purchases may decline during recessionary 
                                       periods or at other times when disposable income is lower. According to the Tea Association of the 
                                       USA, Inc., the U.S. tea market is expected to grow  from $7.7 billion in 2010 to nearly $15 billion by 
                                       the end of 2014, and the specialty tea portion of the tea market will be the fastest growing segment, 
                                       with annual increases in the 10-20% range (sour         ce: U.S. Tea Association). The ability of the 
                                       Company to educate U.S. consumers on the many pos itive attributes of tea  as compared to other 
                                       drink options, such as soda or coffee, and help drive growth of the overall U.S. tea market is critical 
                                       to the future growth prospects of the business in  spite of the robust outlook for the U.S. tea market 
                                       and specialty tea growth projections.   In addition to beverage alternatives to tea, competition looms 
                                       from other specialty retailers who offer products that vie for consumers disposable income dollars.

                                  EXPECT STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT SALES GROWTH TO CONTINUE 
                                  We believe strong sales trends should continue.  In 3Q11, sales increased 35% year-over-year 
                                  following four consecutive years of 35%+ in  creases year-over-year, despite macroeconomic 
                                  pressures in 2008-2009. Sales growth over the la  st four years has benefit ed from a significant 
                                  number of new store openings (admittedly off a small base of 47 stores in 2006) and a consistently 
                                  rising average ticket. We expect sales to grow in   the 20-30% range over the next several years, 
                                  aided by new store openings, increasing average ticket, greater traffic and transactions, as well as 
                                  improved product offerings.

                                  #1  ACCELERATED     N EW  S TORE   O PENINGS IN THE   U NITED  S TATES   
                                  Expect 60-80 openings per year.  We believe that TEA can maintain one of the highest growth 
                                  rates in our coverage universe over the next four to five years, with new store openings to drive the 
                                  majority of year-over-year EPS growth. Despite the Companys high penetration in A malls across 
                                  the country, we think TEA has an adequate amount of  quality, lower rent locations in B malls as 
                                  well as some street locations it could tap to complete its 500-store goal by 2015. We think the lower 
                                  rent structure should more than offset the lowe  r than historical average sales PSF in year one, 
                                  thereby helping to maintain the profitability of t he new store base. Additionally, we think expansion 
                                  should become easier as the store base grows because the Company will be able to leverage a 
                                  bigger pool of store managers and trained sales   associates as well as its upgraded information 
                                  systems to help with future openings. Finally, we think TEAs sales should benefit over time from a 
                                  new CRM and marketing program, which should        drive higher traffic, transactions and new 
                                  customers to the concept. 
                                   
                                  #2  INTERNATIONAL    E XPANSION    
                                  International expansion through both franchise and owned stores.    With franchise royalty 
                                  income representing less than 1% of total sales in FY10 (ended January 30, 2011), we believe that 
                                  the international segment could become a meaningful  contributor to earnings over time. Since the 
                                  end of 2010, the Company added three franchise stores in Mexico; TEA now operates a total of 18 
                                  franchise stores, including 16 in Mexico (via Casa Internacional) and two in the United States. The 
                                  Company also signed a multi-year franchise agreement with Alshaya in September 2011, to 
                                  develop mall-based Teavana stores in eight countries  across the Middle East (including Bahrain, 
                                  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Lebano n and Jordan). The first store in the Middle 
                                  East is expected to open later this year. The Company's franchise agreements provide franchise 
                                  rights for a period of 10-15 years and require franchisees to sell products solely purchased from 
                                  TEA. These stores carry a similar selection of   tea and non-tea merchandise but have a higher 
                                  percentage of beverage sales than TEA's owned stores. In addition, the Company entered Canada 
                                  during 4Q11 by opening a directly owned retail stor e. We believe that while the majority of TEA's 
                                  international expansion will be through franchis e stores, the Company will open directly owned 
                                  stores in select markets. Over the near term, we  believe TEA will look to enter Western Europe;

                                  and over the longer term, TEA will likely look to   enter South America, Russia, India, China, 
                                  Australia and Africa. 
                                   
                                  #3  P OTENTIAL   E NTRANCE INTO     CPG 
                                  Over time, Teavana could enter the CPG market.  We think the Company will tread carefully in 
                                  this arena given the premium positioning in the market. The current iteration of single-cup brewer 
                                  machines is not ideal for tea preparation given that they do not steep, rather, they focus on passing 
                                  hot water quickly. However, a number of companies have added innovation to their tea machines, 
                                  including Brevilles automatic tea maker. A seco nd potential offering is a ready-to-drink product. 
                                  There have been a number of offerings in this space (Teas Tea, Tazo, Honest Tea, among others). 
                                  However, given the strength of Teav anas brand as well as its proprietary tea blends, we think this 
                                  could provide a long-term opportunity.

                                  The Company is highly reliant on a small number of vendors.  The Company does not own or 
                                  operate any tea estates, blending operations or   manufacturing facilities. Instead, the Company 
                                  relies on more than 100 vendors to supply single-estate and specially blended teas as well as tea-
                                  related merchandise on a continuous basis. T EA does not have long-term purchase contracts with 
                                  the vendors or other contractual assurances of   continued supply, pricing or exclusive access to 
                                  products; any of the Companys suppliers or m anufacturers could discontinue supplying Teavana 
                                  with loose-leaf tea or tea-related merchandise in sufficient quantities. During FY10, the Companys 
                                  two largest vendors supplied 40% of its total    inventory purchases. The Company could be 
                                  adversely affected if any of its vendors entered in to arrangements with Teavanas competitors to 
                                  sell similar tea products, including giving competitors exclusive licensing arrangements or exclusive 
                                  access to tea blends and other products or limit ing TEAs access to such arrangements or blends 
                                  or other products. In addition, TEA would be adve   rsely affected if other natural/macro events 
                                  occurred, such as weather, crop disease, labor relations, import/export and customs difficulties. We 
                                  believe TEA has a very seasoned merchandising team who has very well-established relationships 
                                  with some of the industrys most experienced a nd influential tea brokers and tea gardens around 
                                  the world. As such, we think the quality and ble  nds of tea that Teavana offers are not easily 
                                  duplicable.

                                   A move to direct sourcing for non-tea merchandise has helped improve gross margins.  The 
                                   Company's move to direct sourcing for non-tea merchandise late in 3Q10 has led to significant 
                                   year-over-year increases in gross margin over       the last four quarters  as well as substantial 
                                   increases in inventory (both in the warehouse a nd in-transit). With this  strategy shift, TEA not only 
                                   gained greater control of the production and distribu tion of its non-tea merchandise categories, but 
                                   also captured the distributor marg in and forged stronger direct relationships with the factories. We 
                                   believe the improved factory relationships should help TEA greatly in the future as the Company 
                                   continues to develop innovative, customized products to sell on an exclusive basis. On the flipside, 
                                   the procurement of loose tea continues to be s    ourced primarily through tea brokers, which we 
                                   believe may be the most efficient manner to garner the product.

                                   balances at the end of 2011 (estimated at $7.6 million) should return to similar levels as the end of 
                                   last year ($7.9 million). Moreover, we believe the Company should generate positive free cash flow 
                                   in 2012 and going forward.

                                 BRINGING A SENSE OF ADVENTURE TO THE MALL 
                                 Founded in 1997, Teavana offers premium loos  e teas and tea-related merchandise through a 
                                 distinctive store ambiance, know  ledgeable staff and healthy living lifestyle. Inspired by their 
                                 international travels and passion for tea, CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy Mack, wanted to 
                                 make high-quality teas easily accessible and opened  their first store in Atlanta, Ga. To expand its 
                                 store base, Teavana targeted high traffic locati  ons within malls, lifestyle centers and other high 
                                 sales volume retail venues. In 2004, the Company partnered with Parallel Investment Partners for 
                                 capital resources and strategic advice to support accelerated growth plans. From 2006 to 2011, the 
                                 Company grew from 47 to 196 (as of 3Q11) stores , more than tripling it s store base. Each store 
                                 offers a unique Heaven of Tea environment, equi  pped with highly interactive and well-trained 
                                 teaologists to guide customers in understanding tea and its health benefits. 
                                  
                                  
                                 TENURED MANAGEMENT TEAM 
                                 Teavanas management team is highly entrepreneurial.  With his comprehensive knowledge of 
                                 the retailing business, Andrew Mack founded and  served as CEO of Teavana since 1997. In 2005, 
                                 Daniel Glennon joined to serve as CFO. He has extensive experience serving as CFO or VP of 
                                 Finance for three small or early stage corporations . Peter Luckhurst serves as EVP of Operations 
                                 and was promoted within the Company after serving as VP for Stores from 2005-2010. With 
                                 tenured executives, we believe the management   team will strongly execute Teavanas growth 
                                 strategy. Insider ownership remains  very high, as founder Andrew Mack still owns roughly 
                                 56% of the Company.

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

 Reason for Report:
                                                 CONCLUSION:
 Company Update
                                                 We are reiterating our Overweight rating on TEA shares as we round into the new year
 Changes            Previous       Current       and in view of the significant growth prospects ahead for this high-end purveyor of
 Rating                    --   Overweight       teas and tea-related gifts. We believe Santa hauled around tea from house to house this
 Price Tgt                 --       $27.00       year and Teavana likely saw upside in their category--especially when cold-weather
 FY12E EPS                 --         $0.45      apparel and accessories likely failed to bring joy to their respective retailers. Longer-

                                                 term, we believe Teavana is still in the early stages of its domestic store growth, and
 FY12E Rev (mil)           --       $165.3
                                                 we are encouraged by continued e-commerce strength as well as Teavana's market
 FY13E Rev (mil)           --       $208.5
                                                 entry into Canada.

 52 Week Low                        $14.28        Price Versus Transactions? That Is The (Investor) Question. In the bulk of
 12-Month Price Target              $27.00         our note we have set aside five plausible reasons why Teavana's same-store sales
     35x FY14E EPS                                 have been largely price-driven as opposed to transaction-driven. Read on for the
 Shares Out (mil)                      39.0        details, but we'll say this now: it is likely more about optics than about some
 Market Cap. (mil)                  $690.7
                                                   fundamental flaw in their growth strategy. We believe Teavana is growing rapidly

 Book Value/Share                     $1.38        and expanding the high-end tea category in the process. Moreover, we believe their
 Net Cash Per Share                    NM          customer adopts into the brand and then either replenishes on line and/or replenishes
 Debt to Total Capital                  8%         in greater quantities on subsequent, but less frequent, visits. There's no shame in

 Fiscal Year End:                      Jan        from their innovative tea blends launch in FQ3, Teavana is likely to have posted a
 Rev (mil)        2011A    2012E     2013E         solid holiday selling seasons--particularly in view of the fact that non-cold weather

 Jul               $23.0A   $31.3A   $38.7E        the lack of cold weather in which to sell such goods. This holiday at Teavana saw

 FY              $124.7A   $165.3E  $208.5E        last year. As a reminder, the holiday season is critically important to Teavana, and
 CY              $165.3A   $208.5E  $261.8E        we expect FQ4 to account for slightly more than two thirds of annual EPS in FY12

                                                   We note that management is slated to present at the 14th Annual ICR XChange

 Jul               $0.02A   $0.03A   $0.04E        next week in Miami. This would be their first appearance post-holiday and we

                                                 RISKS TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TARGET PRICE:
                                                 Macroeconomic pressures, risk to opening stores internationally and working with
                                                 franchise partners, reliance on key top management, limited ability to hedge costs.

                                   Teavana present on Wednesday January 11  , we thought it appropriate to address the 
    Question                     single biggest question surrounding Teavana’s investment thesis:  why are same-store sales 
                                   driven by price and not transaction?  We aim to offer our insights and why we believe 
                                   Teavana makes for a great growth story for 2012.    
                                    
                                   Question:  Why are Teavana’s same-store sales driven by price and not transactions? 
                                    
                                   Good question.  We’ve been doing a great deal of thinking in and around this common 
                                   question.  To be clear, this dynamic in the same-store sales metric have been known since 
                                   the time of the company’s initial offering roadshow; so for those coming into the story now, 
                                   know that this isn’t “new.”  The spirit of the question is valid:  in fact, we completely agree 
                                   that early-stage brands/concepts should be more transactionally driven in their sales trends 
                                   as opposed to price-driven.  That said, we struggle to conclude (as some have done on the 
                                   short side of this stock) that it is the definitive sign of a “fad” or “non-scalable concept.” 
                                    
                                   Here are some plausible reasons why Teavana’s “comps” could be more price-driven than 
                                   transactionally driven. 
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #1:  In-store beverages cloud the metric. 
                                    
                                   Teavana has historically sold prepared tea beverages in their store—almost, in our view, as 
                                   a customer service as opposed to a full-fledged customer acquisition strategy.  Though 
                                   prepared beverages currently account for only about 4% of total sales, we believe they 
                                   account for about 25% of the total transactions.  As the company has continued to de-
                                   emphasize in-store prepared tea beverages, transactions have declined.  We believe this 
                                   dynamic is leveling off and will very likely become less relevant as a potential call-out in the 
                                   same-store sales metrics as we head into the new year.

                                   Plausible Answer #2:  Marketing (aka “new customer acquisition”) has not been a focus up 
                                   until now.  Customers are tripping into Teavana, not being “advertised” into Teavana. 
                                    
                                   Yes, you read that correctly; Teavana has not yet announced a head of marketing.  We 
                                   continue to be amazed that Teavana has found success thus far without one—likely a 
                                   testament to the brand’s inherent draw—but 2012 beckons a head of marketing to be 
                                   installed in our view.  The primary reason, we believe, is wrapped up in a more cogent new 
                                   customer acquisition strategy—particularly in an as-of-yet-launched loyalty program.  
                                   Some of the best retailers and brands have a successful loyalty program—one that helps 
                                   recognize their best customers—driving frequency of visits (aka “traffic”) to stores and 
                                   higher average transaction values (aka “conversion and pricing”).  Ironically, we believe tea 
                                   drinkers are naturally loyal to the brew itself; thus we believe Teavana’s launch of a loyalty 
                                   program in 2012 would square well with this targeted customer base.   
                                    
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #3:  In-store training focuses on driving price, not transactions.   
                                    
                                   Personal story time.  We recently visited a Teavana store to buy some Christmas-y tea.  We 
                                   intended to buy two ounces on our trip.  By the time the transaction was over, the store 
                                   associate had sold me a half-pound of tea—four times the amount we intended to buy.  
                                   How did she do that?  She suggested a blend of teas from the wall of 100 choices—which 
                                   consisted of two teas at two ounces each and one tea at four ounces.  Tack on the new tin I 
                                   just purchased and voila we spent nearly $40.  What just happened!?  Now, it will 
                                   technically take us four times the amount of time needed to consume the tea.  We surmise 
                                   that the store associate is trained and possibly paid for up selling each transaction.  Should 
                                   Teavana choose to emphasize “appetizers over entrees,” frequency (traffic/transactions) 
                                   could move higher.

                                   Plausible Answer #4:  E-commerce growing as a means to replenish tea purchasing. 
                                    
                                   Another good answer is wrapped up in the rapidly rising e-commerce channel: perhaps 
                                   “she” is being introduced into the brand at retail and then replenishing in total or in part 
                                   with her purchases online.  Not that we recommend blending e-commerce transaction 
                                   metrics into the retail transaction metrics, but we note there is a meaningful e-commerce 
                                   growth rate afoot—and it has happened without the help of a marketing director.

                                   E-commerce revenues have grown at a CAGR of 56% since FY08, and in FY11 the channel 
                                   represented 7% of sales.  Management expects to achieve 10% e-commerce penetration 
                                   longer-term, and we believe this will likely occur in the next three to four years.  The 
                                   merchandise assortment and mix between loose tea and hard goods online is comparable to 
                                   Teavana’s brick and mortar locations, and we believe that a strong majority of Teavana’s 
                                   e-commerce customers are also brick and mortar customers.  Growth of the e-commerce 
                                   channel will likely stem from new customer acquisition as Teavana grows its store base 
                                   towards 500 locations from its current total of 196.   
                                    
                                   We believe that e-commerce sales could potentially represent 12% to 15% of net sales over 
                                   the next five to seven years as multi-channel customers increasingly migrate online and as 
                                   customers utilize the website more and more as an educational tool.  Teavana has highly 
                                   functional mobile and tablet applications, including for the iPhone and iPad, which offer 
                                   full purchasing functionality, suggestions of new blends to try, and even a “tea timer” that 
                                   can tell customers when to stop steeping their tea depending on the type of tea and brewing 
                                   method. 
                                    
                                   The growing penetration of Teavana’s e-commerce business should be a natural lift to total 
                                   company operating margin, as we believe the online channel is more profitable and requires 
                                   minimal capital investment to support.  We believe that the average order size through the

                                   e-commerce channel is approximately 20% higher than in stores (excluding prepared 
                                   beverages sold through the company’s stores).  Furthermore, we believe that the recent 
                                   launch of Teavana’s auto-ship program for loose teas, which enables customers to receive 
                                   periodic deliveries on any teas at the customers’ discretion, will likely help to further 
                                   increase the merchandise mix penetration of loose tea, which could have a significant 
                                   positive impact on gross margin. 
                                    
                                    
                                   Plausible Answer #5:  Teavana’s retail footprint is growing faster than the market for 
                                   specialty tea. 
                                    
                                   We expect Teavana to benefit from growth in overall U.S. tea consumption, as well as 
                                   outperformance of high-end specialty tea brands relative to mass brands typically sold 
                                   through the food, drug, and mass channel.  A number of industry groups project U.S. tea 
                                   consumption to increase at an 8% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years, and we 
                                   believe the domestic tea market is still very much in the early stages of the “high-end-
                                   ification” that has characterized previously homogeneous categories ranging from prepared 
                                   coffee to athletic apparel to cupcakes to headphones.  Whereas these categories had few 
                                   high-end, niche, or differentiated offerings widely available to consumers as recently as five 
                                   or ten years ago, we believe it is now considered commonplace among America’s upper-
                                   middle class to pay $4 for a latte from Starbucks, a $100 for a pair of lululemon yoga pants, 
                                   $5 for a Crumbs cupcake, or $70 for a pair of Skullcandy headphones.   
                                    
                                   What do these product categories all have in common?  They all target an end-use that has 
                                   widespread demographic appeal, and high-end offerings in each of these categories can 
                                   easily be marketed to or perceived by customers as having a strong value proposition, either 
                                   because of a low average ticket and opening price point (i.e. SBUX, CRMB), or because of a 
                                   low “dollars per use” ratio (i.e. LULU, SKUL).  We believe that tea could be undergoing a 
                                   similar transformation, with high-end specialty brands likely to substantially outpace the 
                                   overall category growth rate for the foreseeable future.  In addition to widespread 
                                   demographic appeal, we believe Teavana can easily communicate its value proposition to 
                                   upper-income customers who see themselves as savvy, cost-conscious consumers.  After all, 
                                   two ounces of Teavana’s basic loose teas cost under $4, and one could reasonably expect a 
                                   $200 cast iron teapot to last for decades and sustain hundreds (or even thousands) of uses. 
                                    
                                   According to the Tea Association of the USA, specialty tea consumption at the wholesale 
                                   level has grown at a CAGR of 17% per year over the past decade.  Assuming a solid finish 
                                   to the year, Teavana’s sales have grown at a compound annual rate of 37% since 2006 
                                   (FY07).

                                    So while we expect the market for tea consumption to grow and the market for high-end 
                                    tea specialty stores (dominated by Teavana) to grow, we surmise that Teavana’s unit 
                                    growth rate might be slightly ahead of high-end tea consumption.  The good news is that 
                                    they stand to nearly, solely benefit from the “catch up” of the market for high-end tea.  In 
                                    the meantime, and in concert with the potential, plausible reasons enumerated above, 
                                    TEA’s same-store sales metrics may optically continue to be price-driven versus transaction 
                                    count-driven.  And we’re okay with this dynamic.   
                                     
                                     
                                     
    Un-modeled                   Our published EPS estimates for Teavana call for a CAGR of approximately 35% over the 
    Opportunity: CPG             next three years--well above the growth rates for most of its specialty retail peers.  
    Business                      However, we believe much of TEA’s incremental value lies beyond the scope of our model, 
                                    which is based only on the company’s existing brick and mortar and e-commerce channels.  
                                    Longer-term, we believe that Teavana could launch a viable consumer packaged goods 
                                    (CPG) line, which would leverage the company’s supply-chain capabilities and likely entail 
                                    minimal incremental overhead expense.   
                                     
                                    We believe Teavana is a strong candidate for a CPG line for several reasons.  As is the case 
                                    with the brick and mortar specialty channel, the competitive landscape for high-end teas in 
                                    the domestic CPG market is highly fragmented and the larger players primarily focus on tea 
                                    bags instead of loose tea.  Teavana’s price points and brand positioning would make it a 
                                    strong partner, in our opinion, for high-end grocery or natural foods stores.  Furthermore, 
                                    with Teavana on a trajectory to exceed $100 million in revenue from loose tea sales alone 
                                    next year, we believe Teavana’s scale and sourcing efficiencies would enable it to offer 
                                    high-end grocery stores a branded wholesale CPG offering at favorable economics relative 
                                    to the grocer pursuing a private label offering. 
                                     
                                    In the exhibit below, we have illustrated what we believe the potential impact of a CPG 
                                    business could be for Teavana.  Given the high merchandise margins Teavana enjoys on its 
                                    loose teas, we believe that even after taking into account packaging and other variable 
                                    product costs, Teavana would likely achieve very high product margins on a CPG line.  We 
                                    believe that Teavana could likely add $0.09 to EPS longer-term, depending on its ability to 
                                    secure distribution to a sufficient number of doors.  To be clear, these projections are not

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

       Highlights From Meetings With Management                                              Stock Rating:        Outperform 
                                                                                             Company Profile:Aggressive Growth     
           We recently hosted several days of investor meetings with Teavanas management, 
           during which investors focus centered on three main concerns: 1) new store 
           productivity, 2) the lack of mean ingful transaction growth in same -store sales, and 3) 
                                                                                             Symbol:               TEA (NYSE)
           inventory growth headed into the holidays.
                                                                                             Price:      $15.11(52-Wk.: $14-$29)
                                                                                             Market Value (mil.):        $578
           Management reiterated that the class of 2011 stores is meeting plan, and we believe Fiscal Year End:        January 
           that new store productivity is at or above the higher end of the companystarget of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate :30%
           $600,000 to $ 700,000 in annual store sales.  Moreover, we believe that the analysis Dividend/ Yield:        None    
           that several other analysts have done imputing below-plan new store productivity is 
           fundamentally flawed in several ways, including failing to account for a 15-month           2010A   2011E   2012E
           rather than 12 -month comp base and failing to adjust for $600,000 in year-ago sales Estimates*
           from the now -discontinued SpecialTeas business (a wholesale and Internet business EPS  Q1    $0.05  A$0.09  $0.13
           discontinued as of the end of 2010).  Simply making the adjustment for SpecialTeas    Q2      $0.02  A$0.03  $0.04
                                                                                                 Q3      $0.01  A$0.02  $0.04
           alone increases calculated new store productivity in the third quarter to 84% from 
                                                                                                 Q4      $0.24  $0.31   $0.41

           Looking forward, however, investors sh ould be cognizant that new store productivity 
           over the next several years will likely trend downward (particularly in 2013 and  Trading Data (Thomson Financial)

           (250 A and 250 B malls).  However, as the sales productivity per st  ore migrates 
                                                                                             Long-Term Debt/Total Capital (MRQ)  NA 
           closer to $600,000 in first -year sales, occupancy costs will also decline, keeping the Book Value Per Share (MRQ)NA

           While comps have remained healthy (up 8.5% including e  -commerce in the third    Enterprise Value/EBITDA(TTM)22.6x

         William Blair & Company, L.L.C.
                Importantly, since tea is a consumable item with a long shelf life, increased volumes of tea purchased per transaction 
                can weigh materially on overall growth in transactions.   For example, if a portion of customers extend their  purchase 
                cycle to six weeks f rom four, the number of transactions from those customers would decline more than 30%  ,while 
                the average ticket  would increase proportionally.   As a result, the lengthening purchase cycles of some customers 
                could mask increased transactions from new custome   rs on a consolidated reported basis.  
                Admittedly, without knowing the average volume of tea sold per transaction, it is difficult to ascertain just how much 
                the increase in UPT is weighing on transaction growth as a result of lengthening purchase cycles.  However, field 
                checks of stores  indicate  that new customer growth remains healthy. In addition, Teavanas oldest class of stores 
                (2004 or older) continues to comp roughly in line with the overall bricks-and-mortar average of roughly 6%, which 
                intuitively  would be very difficult to achieve without the addition of new customers to the base.
                Inventory increased 79% year  -over-year,to $32.5 million ,at the end of the third quarter, reflecting  : 1) new store 
                openings,  2) the move to direct sourcing (which occu  rred in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in more in-
                transit inventory relative to the year  -ago quarter), 3) early receipts to take advantage of product and freight 
                discounts,  and  4) a greater depth of inventory to support holiday sales (particularly big-selling items). While we 
                understand the propensity to worry over the markdown risk associated with large increases in inventory, much of 
                Teavanas inventory increase is structural  ,given the move to direct sourcing (inventory was up 82% at the end of the 
                second quarter).   In addition, none of the increase is for seasonallyspecific product and instead reflects product that 
                Teavana sells year round, thereby virtually eliminating the markdown risk.
                Other key points  include:
                    Teavana is planning  on its normal post -holiday Heavenly Sale beginning December 26, which is utilized every 
                    year to clear out discontinued merchandise and tea.
                    Management still expects a 300 -basis-point improvement in operating margin by 2015, driven equally by gross 
                    margin (as the merchandise mix increasingly shifts to tea) and leverage on SG&A.  However, with a material 
                    benefit to gross margin from direct sourcing having already occurred, gross margin gains in the next few years 
                    will likely be much more muted.
                    Beverages, which have been deemphasized since 2006, are expected to stabilize at 3% to 4% of sales ,
                    representing about 20% to 25% of transactions (down from a peak of 8% to 10% of sales and roughly 40% of 
                    transactions) .
                    Management continues to expect a  vice preside nt of marketing to be selected this quarter, with the new hire 
                    expected to develop the marketing department as well as new initiatives such as a CRM system and a loyalty 
                    program (both of which could potentially help drive traffic in the second half of 2012).  
                    While managements main objective continues to be achieving 500 stores in the U.S. by 2015, we expect 
                    international to also be further explored on both a company-operated and licensed basis (with Western Europe 
                    the most likely next market for company  -operated stores after the first Canadian store recently opened).  In 
                    addition, we suspect Teavana will likely explore its potential in CPG, however likely not until 2013 or 2014 at the 
                    earliest.
                The 10 days before Christmas are Teavanas biggest selling   days of the year, with those  10 days accounting for 10% of 
                annual sales (versus roughly 20% for the four weeks prior to Christmas and 40% for the entire fourth quarter).  
                Encouragingly, our channel checks so far in the holiday season have been robust, and we believe Teavana is well 
                positio ned to potentially beat its mid single-digit comp guidance for the quarter, which could lead to earnings upside 
                versus guidance of $0.29 to $0.31 and our and the consensus estimates of $0.31. 
                At 24 times our 2012 estimates, Teavanas stock is now trading at a discount to its 30% long-term growth rate. We 
                would be buyers of Teavana at current levels, as we believe the story is clean with a long growth path ahead,  as

                evidenced by extraordinary sales productivity of $994 per square foot in 2010 (among the highest of all mall-based 
                retailers) and consistent sales performance across all geographies. Moreover,  Teavana is one of the fastest-growing 
                retailers in the United States, and we expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% to yield 
                annual revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to five years and EPS growth of 30%-plus.  We

        Stock ratings, price targets, and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. uses a three-point system to rate stocks. Individual ratings
        and price targets (where used) reflect  the expected performance of the stock relative to the broader  market  (generally the S&P 500, unless 
        otherwise indicated) over  the next  12 months. The assessment of expected performance is a function  of near-, intermediate-, and long-term 
        company  fundamentals, industry  outlook, confidence  in  earnings  estimates, valuation  (and  our  valuation  methodology), and  other  factors. 
        Outperform (O)  stock expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M)  stock expected to perform 
        approximately in line with the broader market over the next 12 months; Underperform (U)  stock expected to underperform the broader market 
        over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not currently rated. The valuation methodologies used to determine price targets (where 
        used) include (but are not limited to) price -to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with the relevant market), P/E -to-growth-rate (PEG) 
        ratio, market capitalization/revenue multi ple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.

         William Blair & Company, L.L.C.

        Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more 
        volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over a longer -term horizon, of the business risk of the company 
        relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track 
        record, market  leadership,  distinctive  capabilities);  2)  financial  profile  (earnings  growth  rate/ consistency,  cash  flow  generation, return  on 
        investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, confidence in long-term 
        growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative to the broader  William Blair universe; Core Growth (C) 
        Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk is higher relative to 
        the broader William Blair universe.

        The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion of the   individual analyst and 
        are subject to change at any time.

                  only).  The +46% increase in e-commerce sales was                
                  also very solid. 3Q11 EPS of $0.02 was in line with 
                  consensus and $0.01 above our estimate. 

                  What's new:  Stock down 9% likely on inventory 
                  concerns, 2.5% decline in same store transactions, and 
                  decelerating new store productivity (we calculate ~74% 
                  vs. 77% last Q and 82% in 1Q).  We think inventory 
                  concerns (inventory +79% y/y) are overblown as TEA 
                  eliminated the middleman to directly source product, 
                  which requires ownership of inventory earlier in the 
                  supply chain.  

                  Market concerns in declining transactions and 
                  lower new store productivity may be well-founded.  
                  We would have expected consistently positive 
                  transaction growth in an underpenetrated category (tea) 
                  and with such a new store base (196 stores at 3Q11-end  
                  vs. 141 LY at this time and 107 2 years ago).   

                  New store productivity is inline with management 
                  expectations. Existing fleet averages ~$860,000 per 
                  store.  New stores are expected to generate $600,000 - 
                  $700,000 annually, or 70-80% of the existing fleet 
                  productivity.  While our 74% productivity calculation is 
                  inline with management plan they may have fallen short 
                  of market expectations. 

                  Maintaining our 4Q11 EPS; raising FY11.  We 
                  maintain our $0.41 4Q11 EPS estimate (based on a 3%

                  guidance is $0.43-$0.45 (vs. Streets $0.46 and the             a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                  previous $0.42-$0.44 plan).                                     have a conflict of interest that could affect the

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with

 Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months.
     At times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

      On TEA With An                     belief that Teavana is in the early stages of a significant store expansion plan with a proven 
      Overweight Rating                 and highly profitable concept.  The biggest pushback we anticipate receiving on our 
                                                  Overweight rating is from investors who question whether a stock should ever deserve a 
                                                  35x multiple on 2013 earnings when we are “only” looking for 35% EPS growth this year, 
                                                  especially against a choppy macroeconomic backdrop characterized by high unemployment 
                                                  and fiscal austerity.  We’re no strangers to valuation, and these are certainly valid concerns, 
                                                  but if our 15+ years of experience covering retail growth stocks has taught us anything, it’s 
                                                  that over-reliance on traditional valuation techniques for a proven, early-stage growth 
                                                  brand is an easy way to get burned. 
                                                   
                                                  The model we set forth represents an achievable and likely beatable set of assumptions 
                                                  through January 2014, and it is important to note several things about our projections.  
                                                  First of all, our model is predicated on growth of Teavana’s core company-owned stores 
                                                  and e-commerce operations.  The possibility of growth of the company’s small franchise 
                                                  business, the potentially powerful launch of a consumer-packaged-goods or business-to-
                                                  business line, and any future international store openings are all excluded from our model.  
                                                  As detailed throughout this report, we believe that such prospects represent potentially 
                                                  significant contributions to earnings, and we think it is important to be mindful of these 
                                                  opportunities.

                                                  For valuation purposes, we believe it is most appropriate to consider Teavana when 
                                                  compared to other high growth brands, particularly those with a healthy lifestyle niche.  As 
                                                  shown in Exhibit 1, TEA shares currently trade at 41x 2012 (FY13) EPS, which represents a 
                                                  premium to its peer group average of 26x.  We believe a premium valuation is justified in 
                                                  view of Teavana’s well-above average growth prospects, and we note that valuation for 
                                                  TEA is in line with its peer group when looking at 2012 PEG.

                                   Our price target of $27 is based on 35x our FY14 EPS estimate of $0.77, a premium to other 
                                   publicly traded lifestyle brands and retailers. However, few other companies, in our 
                                   opinion, have such a well mapped-out road of double-digit earnings growth. Even fewer are 
                                   early enough along in the process that outsized earnings growth can support a premium 
                                   multiple for an extended period of time as growth rates remain high, in our view.  We 
                                   believe our assigned multiple of 35x is appropriate given our expectation for 30% to 40% 
                                   EPS growth or more for the foreseeable future. 
                                    
                                   We also note that Teavana is slated to deliver about 70% of its annual earnings in the 
                                   upcoming fourth quarter.  Should we gain visibility or increased conviction in the 
                                   company’s ability to meet or beat our expectations, we would be inclined to review our

    Restaurant                    opening of its first store in Atlanta.  In the fourteen years since the company’s founding, 
                                   Teavana has grown to 179 stores throughout the United States, offering proprietary loose 
                                   tea blends and a mostly exclusive assortment of premium teapots and kettles.  E-commerce 
                                   sales accounted for 7% of total revenue in FY11, and we believe e-commerce penetration 
                                   could likely exceed 10% in the next three to four years.  Teavana’s stores are located 
                                   primarily in high-traffic locations in malls and lifestyle centers.  Typical locations are 
                                   located in centers with a premium anchor and upscale co-tenants such as Williams-Sonoma, 
                                   Coach, and Chico’s.  Its stores are relatively small (800 to 900 square feet), but they are 
                                   highly productive, averaging about $1,000 per square foot. 
                                    
                                   Teavana’s merchandise assortment consists of loose tea and tea blends, tea-related 
                                   merchandise, and beverages.  As shown in the following exhibit, loose tea represents the 
                                   lion’s share of total revenue, with the remainder coming primarily from tea-related 
                                   merchandise such as teapots, kettles, brewers, mugs, and other accessories.  With the 
                                   obvious exception of prepared beverages, Teavana’s sales breakdown is similar in stores as 
                                   it is online.

     Competitive                      We believe Teavana fills a highly profitable, unoccupied niche in the competitive landscape.   
     Landscape Is Highly             The market for high-end loose tea and tea-related accessories is highly fragmented, and 
     Fragmented                      there are currently no other specialty retailers of similar size focusing specifically on tea.  As 
                                         shown in the following exhibit, Teavana’s competition in the U.S. market is highly 
                                         fragmented, with no major players exhibiting a strong brick and mortar presence.  We 
                                         believe that Teavana’s scale and leverage, with landlords as well as merchandise vendors, 
                                         enables it to achieve favorable merchandise and occupancy costs relative to what new 
                                         entrants to the market would have to pay.  Thus, we believe that Teavana will likely be able 
                                         to reach its 500 store goal before any formidable competition is able to enter the fray.

     U.S. Tea Market Is               We expect Teavana to benefit from growth in overall U.S. tea consumption, as well as 
     Ripe For Further                 outperformance of high-end specialty tea brands relative to mass brands typically sold 
     “High-End-Ification”            through the food, drug, and mass channel.  A number of industry groups project U.S. tea 
                                         consumption to increase at an 8% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years, and we 
                                         believe the domestic tea market is still very much in the early stages of the “high-end-
                                         ification” that has characterized previously homogeneous categories ranging from prepared 
                                         coffee to athletic apparel to cupcakes to headphones.  Whereas these categories had few 
                                         high-end, niche, or differentiated offerings widely available to consumers as recently as five 
                                         or ten years ago, we believe it is now considered commonplace among America’s upper-
                                         middle class to pay $4 for a latte from Starbucks, a $100 for a pair of lululemon yoga pants, 
                                         $5 for a Crumbs cupcake, or $70 for a pair of Skullcandy headphones.   
                                          
                                         What do these product categories all have in common?  They all target an end-use that has 
                                         widespread demographic appeal, and high-end offerings in each of these categories can 
                                         easily be marketed to or perceived by customers as having a strong value proposition, either 
                                         because of a low average ticket and opening price point (i.e. SBUX, CRMB), or because of a 
                                         low “dollars per use” ratio (i.e. LULU, SKUL).  We believe that tea could be undergoing a 
                                         similar transformation, with high-end specialty brands likely to substantially outpace the 
                                         overall category growth rate for the foreseeable future.  In addition to widespread 
                                         demographic appeal, we believe Teavana can easily communicate its value proposition to 
                                         upper-income customers who see themselves as savvy, cost-conscious consumers.  After all, 
                                         two ounces of Teavana’s basic loose teas costs under $4, and one could reasonably expect a 
                                         $200 cast iron teapot to last for decades and sustain hundreds (or even thousands) of uses.

    Teavana Represents           In the current era of low to no square footage growth, Teavana strikes us as a rare gem of a 
    A Unique Investment          good old-fashioned store growth story.  Teavana checks all of our boxes when it comes to 
    Proposition in                 compelling growth stories: it fills an unaddressed need in the market place; its offerings 
    Today’s Market               have broad demographic and regional appeal; its merchandise is predominantly 
                                   proprietary; and it has a successful operational track record of opening new stores.  Beyond 
                                   that, we note that Teavana’s growth story is quite unique in that its merchandise mix 
                                   naturally shifts to higher-margin loose tea sales as its store base matures.  Thus, when 
                                   Teavana’s store base begins to approach saturation and square footage growth decelerates, 
                                   margin growth will likely begin to accelerate. 
                                    
                                   Growth for Teavana over the next five years will likely stem primarily from new store 
                                   openings, as the company plans to expand its store base from 179 to 500 over the next five 
                                   years.  Given Teavana’s small box size and the widespread demographic appeal of its 
                                   merchandise offerings, we view this as a realistic growth plan.  Furthermore, we note that 
                                   Teavana’s current store base is spread evenly throughout the United States, and that sales 
                                   productivity and profitability varies very little by region.  As shown in the following 
                                   exhibit, we expect Teavana to grow its store base by 34% in FY12 and 31% in FY13.

    Merchandise Mix              Excluding prepared beverages, which account for less than 5% of total net sales, Teavana’s 
    Creates Unique                merchandise assortment has historically consisted of a roughly 50/50 split between loose tea 
    Sales/Margin                  and hard goods such as teapots and kettles, however, as shown in the exhibit below, it has 
    Trajectory                     been skewing towards a higher penetration of loose tea as a percentage of total sales over 
                                    the past five years.  This trend towards a greater proportion of loose tea sales is likely to 
                                    continue for the foreseeable future and has a favorable impact to gross margin, as loose tea 
                                    carries a considerably higher merchandise margin relative to the hard goods that Teavana 
                                    sells.

                                    The primary reason that loose tea is increasing as a percentage of the total mix is a simple 
                                    one, yet it is something rarely encountered in the wonderful world of publicly traded 
                                    specialty retailers.  When a new Teavana new store opens, most of the new store’s 
                                    customers are new to the Teavana brand, and many are new to drinking tea other than 
                                    mass-brand teabags sold through the food, drug, and mass channel.  When a new loyal 
                                    customer is acquired, which naturally tends to happen more in the first year or two the 
                                    store is open, our hypothetical new customer (let’s call her Patti Pekoe) quickly realizes that 
                                    microwaving a mug of water with a teabag in it just isn’t going to cut it anymore.  So she 
                                    buys a stainless steel tea kettle.  Then summer rolls around and she realizes she needs an 
                                    iced tea pitcher.  Eventually she caves and buys that cast iron teapot she’s had her eye on.  
                                    Now that Patti has an adequate arsenal of tea makers in her kitchen, her spending at 
                                    Teavana will likely shift away from hard goods and towards loose tea and blends.

     EBIT Contribution              Ok, so now Patti Pekoe has her cast iron teapot, stainless steel tea kettle, and iced tea 
     Likely Accelerates As           pitcher.  Now what?  She may still buy the occasional tea canister for herself or gift set for a 
     New Stores Mature            friend, but at this point in her tenure as a Teavana customer, her biggest hard good 
                                      purchases are likely behind her.  The evolution of the Patti’s spending pattern has two 
                                      unusual effects on the new store’s profitability.  Firstly, it leads to strong sales in year-one 
                                      for a new store as new customers stock up on hard goods such as teapots and kettles.  This 
                                      leads to a tough comparison in year-two, as the ratio of existing customers to new 
                                      customers increase.  The basket of hard goods that Patti bought in year-one could cost 
                                      anywhere from $150 to $450, and thus it is unlikely that her predominantly-loose-tea-
                                      spending in year-two will be enough to exceed her spending in year-one.  Therefore, unlike 
                                      most other retailers, Teavana’s newest class of comparable stores typically weighs on total 
                                      company same-store sales instead of lifting the chain higher. 
                                       
                                      The second unusual effect on the P&L owing to this spending mix shift is that margins for a 
                                      new store can quickly ramp up even with little to no increase in sales.  Patti may not spend 
                                      as much at Teavana in year-two as she does in year-one, but her basket of purchases in 
                                      year-two, which included a higher proportion of loose tea, likely entailed a substantially 
                                      higher gross margin.  To demonstrate this phenomenon, we have illustrated what we 
                                      believe the EBIT contribution could look like for a hypothetical new store.  As shown in the 
                                      exhibit below, we believe that new stores are likely to see lower same-store sales for the first 
                                      year or two, with EBIT-dollar contribution accelerating in years three and four.

    E-Commerce                  Teavana’s e-commerce revenues have grown at a CAGR of 56% since FY08, and in FY11 
    Becoming a Major             the channel represented 7% of sales.  Management expects to achieve 10% e-commerce 
    Share of  “Tea”-              penetration longer term, and we believe this will likely occur in the next three to four years.  
    Commerce                    The merchandise assortment and mix between loose tea and hard goods online is 
                                   comparable to Teavana’s brick and mortar locations, and we believe that a strong majority 
                                   of Teavana’s e-commerce customers are also brick and mortar customers.  Growth of the e-
                                   commerce channel will likely stem from new customer acquisition as Teavana grows its 
                                   store base towards 500 locations from its current total of 179.   
                                    
                                   We believe that e-commerce sales could potentially represent 12% to 15% of net sales over 
                                   the next five to seven years as multi-channel customers increasingly migrate online and as 
                                   customers utilize the website more and more as an educational tool.  Teavana has highly 
                                   functional mobile and tablet applications, including for the iPhone and iPad, which offer 
                                   full purchasing functionality, suggestions of new blends to try, and even a “tea timer” that 
                                   can tell customers when to stop steeping their tea depending on the type of tea and brewing 
                                   method. 
                                    
                                   The growing penetration of Teavana’s e-commerce business should be a natural to total 
                                   company operating margin, as we believe the online channel is more profitable and requires 
                                   minimal capital investment to support.  We believe that the average order size through the 
                                   e-commerce channel is approximately 20% higher than in stores, even after excluding 
                                   prepared beverages sold through the company’s stores.  Furthermore, we believe that the 
                                   recent launch of Teavana’s auto-ship program for loose teas, which enables customers to 
                                   receive periodic deliveries on any teas at the customer’s discretion, will likely help to further 
                                   increase the merchandise mix penetration of loose tea, which could have a significant 
                                   positive impact on gross margin.

    Real Estate Strategy            New store openings will likely be the primary driver of Teavana’s earnings growth, and we 
    Is On Solid Footing           believe the company’s real estate strategy is well positioned to support this growth.  We 
                                    expect Teavana to open 50 net new stores in FY12, which represents 34% unit growth.  For 
                                    FY13 and FY14, we are estimating unit growth of 31% and 27% respectively, which would 
                                    result in 326 locations by January 2014 versus management’s goal of reaching 500 locations 
                                    in five years. 
                                     
                                    Teavana’s stores are highly productive, averaging about $1000 per square foot with an 
                                    average box size of about 900 square feet.  Due to Teavana’s high sales productivity, small 
                                    box size, strong new store growth, and the high traffic volume its stores capture, we believe 
                                    Teavana is typically viewed as a highly attractive tenant for landlords of enclosed malls and 
                                    lifestyle centers.  Given the large white space in front of Teavana in terms of store growth, 
                                    we believe it is often able to take advantage of opportunistic rents.  As a result, 100% of 
                                    Teavana’s stores generate a positive four-wall EBIT contribution, which we believe is a 
                                    testament to Teavana’s demonstrated success in site selection.  Going forward, 
                                    management has indicated that it has identified about 150 future locations down to the 
                                    individual real estate center, which should alone be sufficient to ensure two to three years of 
                                    unit growth. 
                                     
                                    As shown in the exhibit below, new stores are typically highly productive from the start, 
                                    with an average payback period of about 18 months.  Teavana’s net sales plan for new 
                                    stores is approximately $600,000 to $700,000, and we believe that the contribution margin 
                                    of its stores doing that level had a contribution margin of 25% to 30% in FY11.

    Upside To +3% SSS            Over the past five years, Teavana has achieved average annual same-store sales growth of 
    Projection Would              about 6%.  Teavana’s merchandising and in-store execution initiatives, such as customer 
    Entail Substantial              education and proprietary blends, could likely result in continued mid- to high-single-digit 
    Upside to Earnings            same-store growth in the future.  In the interest of conservatism and in order to account for 
                                    a maturing store base, we are modeling a lower 3% increase in same-store sales through the 
                                    end of FY14.  Given Teavana’s high merchandise margins (particularly on its loose tea 
                                    offerings), we estimate that should Teavana achieve same-store sales in excess of our 3% 
                                    estimate, the EBIT margin on incremental sales would be approximately 50%.   
                                     
                                    Upside to our 3% same-store sales estimate would likely come from new customer 
                                    acquisition, as Teavana continues to educate consumers on the health attributes and 
                                    enjoyable qualities of tea.  Furthermore, we believe there could be opportunities for existing 
                                    customers to spend more than expected, as more experienced customers tend to increase 
                                    their purchasing frequency over time as well as experiment with more expensive loose teas 
                                    and blends. 
                                     
                                    As shown in the exhibit below, we believe the earnings impact from better-than-expected 
                                    same-store sales could be substantial.  We estimate that an 8% increase in same-store sales 
                                    in FY13, assuming no upside to our model for the rest of FY12, would likely add between 
                                    $0.06 and $0.07 of EPS upside to our model, resulting in EPS between $0.65 and $0.66.  For 
                                    FY14, 500 bps of same-store sales outperformance relative to our +3% estimate would 
                                    likely result in $0.08 to $0.09 in upside to our estimate of $0.77.

     Un-Modeled                     Our published EPS estimates call for a CAGR of approximately 35% over the next three 
     Opportunity: CPG              years--well above the growth rates for most of its specialty retail peers.  However, we 
     Business                        believe much of TEA’s incremental value lies beyond the scope of our model, which is 
                                       based only on the company’s existing brick and mortar and e-commerce channels.  Longer-
                                       term, we believe that Teavana could launch a viable consumer packaged goods (CPG) line, 
                                       which would leverage the company’s supply-chain capabilities and likely entail minimal 
                                       incremental overhead expense.   
                                        
                                       We believe Teavana is a strong candidate for a CPG line for several reasons.  As is the case 
                                       with the brick and mortar specialty channel, the competitive landscape for high-end teas in 
                                       the domestic CPG market is highly fragmented and the larger players primarily focus on tea 
                                       bags instead of loose tea.  Teavana’s price points and brand positioning would make it a 
                                       strong partner, in our opinion, for high-end grocery or natural foods stores.  Furthermore, 
                                       with Teavana on a trajectory to exceed $100 million in revenue from loose tea sales alone 
                                       next year, we believe Teavana’s scale and sourcing efficiencies would enable it to offer 
                                       high-end grocery stores a branded wholesale CPG offering at favorable economics relative 
                                       to the grocer pursuing a private label offering. 
                                        
                                       In the exhibit below, we have illustrated what we believe the potential impact of a CPG 
                                       business could be for Teavana.  Given the high merchandise margins Teavana enjoys on its 
                                       loose teas, we believe that even after taking into account packaging and other variable 
                                       product costs, Teavana would likely achieve very high product margins on a CPG line.  We 
                                       believe that Teavana could likely add $0.09 to EPS longer term, depending on its ability to 
                                       secure distribution to a sufficient number of doors.  To be clear, these projections are not 
                                       incorporated in our earnings model and are intended only to give a sense of the potential 
                                       longer-term profitability potential of a CPG line.

     Un-Modeled                    Over the next several years, we believe it is highly likely that management will seek to open 
     Opportunity:                    international stores as Teavana approaches its target of 500 stores in the United States.  We 
     International                    expect international expansion to take a two-pronged approach, with Teavana opening 
     Expansion                       company-owned stores in markets such as Canada and Western Europe, while utilizing 
     (Company-Owned)            franchise agreements to build its presence in less developed global markets.  Given the 
                                      world-wide consumption and awareness of tea, we believe that Teavana could be a viable 
                                      retail concept on every continent on the planet, with the possible exception of Antarctica 
                                      (and even in Antarctica, wouldn’t the few researchers and die-hard        Alien vs. Predator  fans 
                                      out there want a steaming hot cup of tea?).   
                                       
                                      U.S. retailers have a long history of successfully opening stores in Canada, and a shorter 
                                      (but perhaps more profitable) history of successfully expanding to Western European 
                                      markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy.  Markets such as Canada and 
                                      Western Europe typically feature similar real estate dynamics and traffic patterns to the 
                                      United States market, and we believe expansion into these markets represents is achievable 
                                      from an operational standpoint.

                                      using company-owned stores.  Based on our work with other American specialty retailers 
                                      opening stores internationally, our assumptions include slightly higher sales productivity 
                                      and merchandise margins for international stores, partially offset by higher occupancy and 
                                      labor costs.  We believe that company-owned stores in Canada and Western Europe could 
                                      eventually account for $0.36 or more in sustainable annual EPS.

     Un-Modeled                    While we believe Teavana will likely seek to open company-owned stores in Canada and 
     Opportunity:                    Western Europe, we expect international expansion into Latin America, Asia, and the 
     International                    Middle East to be pursued through franchise arrangements.  We believe the global appeal of 
     Expansion                       tea creates the potential for a large customer base in less developed markets, and Teavana’s 
     (Franchised)                    high merchandise margins and flexible real estate requirements likely make Teavana an 
                                      attractive retailer for top-tier local retail operators to partner with.  On 9/2/11, Teavana 
                                      announced that it entered into a ten-year franchise agreement for development in eight 
                                      Middle Eastern countries with the Alshaya group, a leading franchisee with experience 
                                      operating stores with brands such as Starbucks, American Eagle, and Pottery Barn. 
                                       
                                      We fully acknowledge that part of Teavana’s success in the United States has stemmed from 
                                      its ability to grow the overall category of tea by introducing high-end loose tea and hard 
                                      goods that largely represent new category offerings for domestic consumers in new markets 
                                      where Teavana opens a store.  With this in mind, clearly Teavana will face a different set of 
                                      challenges and opportunities on each continent it enters.  While Teavana may find it 
                                      difficult to replicate its U.S. mall-based market positioning in markets such as China, we 
                                      believe there could be substantial opportunity for Teavana to penetrate such markets 
                                      through the travel retail channel, with duty-free stores in particular representing a big 
                                      opportunity. 
                                       
                                      There were 19 franchised Teavana locations at the end of FQ1, up from 15 at the end of 
                                      FY11.  All but two of these stores are in Mexico, and we believe these stores are performing 
                                      well for Teavana’s franchise partner in the region.  In terms of economics, Teavana 
                                      typically collects initial franchise fees in connection with newly franchised stores as well as 
                                      continuing royalty fees, which are based on a percentage of the franchised location’s 
                                      revenue.  Franchisees purchase their stores’ loose tea and hard goods on a wholesale basis 
                                      from Teavana. 
                                       
                                      As shown in the following table, we believe modest growth of Teavana’s franchised doors 
                                      by expanding into new geographic regions could add $0.10 to annual EPS longer term.  This 
                                      growth is based on a set of assumptions which we believe are likely conservative.  
                                      Specifically, our analysis is based on an initial franchise fee of $30,000 and a continuing 
                                      royalty fee of 4.5%.  Our analysis assumes productivity of $500,000 in net sales (to the 
                                      franchisee) per franchised location, which we believe is conservative given that Teavana’s 
                                      company-owned locations averaged more than $800,000 per door in FY11 and the company 
                                      targets $600,000 to $700,000 in first year sales for new domestic locations.

    Risk Factors                  Macro.   Consumer spending is dependent on such macro-economic factors as employment, 
                                   energy prices, consumer confidence, and personal asset values. 
                                    
                                   Competition.   Retail sector is mature, thus relegating the group to margin erosion during 
                                   times of slowdown in demand. 
                                    
                                   International Risks.   Teavana has only limited experience operating outside of the U.S. 
                                   market.  Further growth will depend on the ability to effectively source its products and 
                                   secure capable franchise partners. 
                                    
                                   Limited Ability to Hedge Costs.   Unlike other food commodities such as coffee, milk, and 
                                   frozen concentrated orange juice, tea futures are not traded on any major exchange, thus 
                                   potentially pressuring Teavana’s margins if costs rise. 
                                    
                                   Availability of Real Estate.   Teavana’s growth model is predicated on a high number of new 
                                   store openings.  Should Teavana find it difficult to secure an adequate number of 
                                   appropriate locations, growth targets could be at risk. 
                                    
                                   Dependence on Key Top Management.   We believe a disruption to the ranks could have a 
                                   potential negative impact should a key executive leave the company or join a competitor. 
                                    
                                   Limited Public Company Experience.   Teavana has limited experience operating as a public 
                                   company, and thus may initially find it difficult to manage investor expectations resulting 
                                   in increased stock price volatility.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

    healthy returns, with management targeting ﬁ rst-year cash-on-cash returns of about              Valuation
    75% and a payback period of roughly 18 months.                                                   P/E                              81.2x   58.9x   43.9x
                                                                                                          
    Plenty of room to expand store base.  From about 180 company-owned stores                        Trading Data

    Expect 30% annual EPS growth over next three to ﬁ ve years. We expect 25%-                       Return on Equity (CY11E)                      30%

    revenue growth in the high-20% range. We anticipate consistent operating margin 
    improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more so in calendar 2013 given a 
    favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as stores mature as well as 
    leverage on ﬁ xed costs, although infrastructure investments to support growth will 
    likely constrain margins in 2011.

    Aggressive expansion is main risk. We believe that Teavanas main investment 
    risk is its plan for aggressive store expansion, including 50 new company-owned 
    stores this year (up 34%) and 60 new company-owned stores in 2012 (up 31%). 
    While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to execute on its expansion plans, 
    we view the companys ability to successfully open new stores as critical to the 
    stocks performance.

Summary and Investment  esis

                         Founded in 1997 by current Chairman and CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, Teavana 
                         is a rapidly growing specialty tea retailer, with about 180 domestic mall-based stores across 
                         36 states (including 2 franchised locations) and 17 franchised stores in Mexico. Featuring 
                         a large selection of loose-leaf premium teas as well as tea-related merchandise, Teavana 
                         offers a differentiated and compelling mall-based experience with its inviting store format 
                         and highly trained staff.

                         Teavanas store base has more than tripled in the past four years, and sales have grown 
                         at a compound annual rate of 38% over the same time frame, inclusive of growth of 38% 
                         in 2010 to nearly $125 million. Loose-leaf tea accounts for 56% of sales; tea-related mer-
                         chandise, 40%; and prepared beverages, 4%. Teavanas average ticket is $36 in its stores 
                         ($46 excluding beverages) and $55 online, with the company generating about 7% of sales 
                         through its e-commerce channel.

                         Compelling Premium Tea Retailer With Impressive Sales Productivity
                         Teavanas consumer appeal is illustrated by the companys strong sales productivity of 
                         $944 per square foot in 2010, with consistent performance across geographies. Moreover, 
                         Teavana has experienced positive same-store sales in each of the past ﬁ ve years, with only 
                         one quarter of negative comps (-1.6% in fourth quarter 2008), pointing to the resiliency of 
                         consumer demand for Teavanas products. Given the long shelf life of its products and low 
                         markdown levels, Teavanas gross margin was a healthy 62.9% in 2010, and Teavanas 
                         operating margin increased from 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2010.

                Teavanas stores feature a Wall of Tea (roughly 100 tins of premium loose-leaf tea), a wide 
                array of tea-related accessories and items, and highly trained store associates who educate 
                consumers about Teavanas products and the tea-making process. With premium loose-leaf 
                teas ranging from $3 to $40 for two ounces (the minimum amount sold), Teavana offers an 
                affordable yet premium healthy lifestyle indulgence, with two ounces yielding an average 
                of 20 to 25 cups of teatranslating to less than $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.

                The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, 
                according to market research ﬁ rm Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 
                11% from 2004 through 2009. We believe the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to 
                grow, as the United States represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 
                billion in 2009, with per capita tea consumption well behind many other nations. Encourag-
                ingly, Mintel expects the tea market in the United States to continue to post steady growth, 
                projecting an approximate 6% compound annual growth rate through 2014.

                Excellent Store Productivity Yields Consistently Robust Store-Level Returns
                Teavana averaged sales per store of $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year), with 
                all classes of stores (by age) experiencing gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix 
                becomes increasingly more proﬁ table as stores mature, as the mix naturally shifts toward 
                high-margin loose-leaf tea as a store ages (also indicative of strong customer loyalty).

                Encouragingly, Teavanas performance has been remarkably similar across all regions of the 
                country, including the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consisting 
                of roughly 25% of locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. Teavanas average four-
                wall cash contribution margin was 30% in 2010, with all stores proﬁ table.

                New-store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the 
                company has easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash invest-
                ment of $200,000 to $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are expected 
                to account for future growth. New stores are anticipated to generate 25% cash contribution 
                margins and cash-on-cash returns of about 75%, with a payback period of roughly 18 months.

                Ample Opportunity for Store Expansion
                From about 180 company-owned stores today, we believe that Teavana has the oppor-
                tunity to nearly triple its U.S. store base, in keeping with managements goal of reaching 
                500 domestic stores by 2015. Should Teavana meet its objectives, it would be one of the 
                fastest-growing publicly traded retailers, with 50 new company-owned stores expected in 
                2011 (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).

                While Teavanas growth plans are aggressive, we believe they may also be necessary to ce-
                ment the concepts ﬁ rst-mover advantage, particularly as others are likely to notice Teavanas 
                highly proﬁ table model now that the company is publicly traded. We believe there are 500 
                high-quality domestic malls that meet Teavanas requirements, and we see the potential for 
                the company to augment its mall-based locations with strategically placed street locations in 
                the future. Teavana also has 17 franchised stores in Mexico, and we expect the company to 
                explore additional international expansion opportunities in coming years through company-
                owned development and/or franchised agreements.  To this point, Teavana recently announced 
                a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with Alshaya, a leading franchise operator 
                of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The Cheesecake Factory.

                Over the longer term, we believe the Holy Grail would be for Teavana to evolve from a re-
                tailer into a market-deﬁ ning brand, similar to what Starbucks has achieved over the past 20 
                years. While such stories are rare, we see parallels in Teavana bringing its European-style 
                specialty tea retail experience to the United States to the way Starbucks introduced Ameri-
                cans to Italian-based espresso beverages. If Teavana can deﬁ ne the tea market in the way 
                that Starbucks has dominated specialty coffee, we see the potential for meaningful brand 
                extension opportunities in the premium grocery and foodservice channels (Starbuckss con-

                       We Expect 30% Annual EPS Growth Over the Next Three to Five Years
                       We expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% per year will 
                       yield annual revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to  ﬁ ve years. We 
                       expect a modest contraction in operating margin in 2011 given incremental infrastructure 
                       expenses associated with the companys new store support center, expansion of the com-
                       panys distribution center, and the buildout of systems and marketing functions. In addition, 
                       we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-margin merchandise over the holidays this 
                       year, a category that management believes underperformed in 2010 (merchandise season-
                       ally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).

                       Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, 
                       we expect consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more 
                       so in calendar 2013 given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as 
                       stores mature, the beneﬁ ts of increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on ﬁ xed costs. 
                       Over the longer term, we believe operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, 
                       versus 18.8% in 2010.

                       Primarily reﬂ ecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 
                       in 2012 (up 34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).

                       Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects
                       Teavanas stock valuation of 44 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reﬂ ects a premium 
                       to its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retail-
                       ers such as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to 
                       higher-income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and 
                       lululemon athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even

                its fastest-growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average 
                of 18%.  As a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.5 times exceeds its peer group 
                average of 1.2 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers 
                such as Whole Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.4 
                to 1.8 times).

                While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                premium valuation is justiﬁ ed given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales 
                trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with 
                the potential for upside. We are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggres-
                sive Growth company proﬁ le. 

Investment Risks

                Rate of Store Growth Could Strain Operations
                Teavanas plan to expand its domestic company-owned store base from about 180 stores 
                today to 500 stores over the next ﬁ ve years is ambitious and could strain the companys hu-
                man resources while potentially damaging its distinctive culture based on extensive training 
                and superior customer service. In the near term, Teavana plans to open 50 stores in 2011 
                (up 34%) and 60 stores in 2012 (up 31%), and we project 70 new stores in 2013 (up 27%). 
                While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to execute on its plans for new stores, we 
                view the companys ability to successfully open high-volume new stores as critical to the 
                stocks performance.

                New Stores May Not Be as Productive as Existing Store Base
                Teavana has achieved sales productivity that is among the highest in mall-based retail. 
                However, as the company grows, its proportion of A malls will decrease as Teavana enters 
                a wider array of less productive malls, which could result in average unit volumes declining 
                from current levels. Management is already handicapping for this potential outcome, modeling 
                new store volumes at $600,000 to $700,000. Importantly, even at lower volumes, unit-level 
                returns remain healthy, as stores within this sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution 
                margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.

                Reliance on Single Product Category
                Teavanas business is concentrated on a single productpremium loose-leaf teaand 
                its related merchandise. Teavanas sales would likely be penalized by any negative news 
                related to the quality or safety of tea or tea-related products.

                Exposure to Mall-Based Trafﬁ c Trends and Seasonality of Earnings
                Teavanas mall-based real estate strategy renders it susceptible to mall traf  ﬁ c trends. In 
                addition, Teavana earns the bulk of its earnings in its ﬁ scal fourth quarter of the year, which 
                typically has roughly twice the revenue of any other quarter and contributes the vast major-
                ity of full-year earnings (75% in 2010). As a result, the company is particularly vulnerable to 
                events that hinder consumer spending or mall traf ﬁ c during the holidays. The ﬁ rst quarter 
                is the second-most-proﬁ table quarter for Teavana, with the second and third quarters only 
                slightly proﬁ table.

                Limited Float Post-Deal
                Teavana has a limited ﬂ oat following the companys IPO, as founder and CEO Andrew Mack 
                still holds 57% of shares and private-equity investor Parallel Investment Partners holds 19%.

Distinctive Premium Loose-Leaf Tea Retailer 

                Teavana was founded in 1997 by CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, as a channel 
                for their passion for tea that they acquired through their worldwide travels. Teavanas  ﬁ rst 
                store opened in Atlanta that year, followed by a second store in Atlanta in 1998 and a third 
                in 2000. In 2001, the couple expanded Teavanas geographic presence with an opening in 
                Minneapoliss Mall of America, followed by openings in 2002 in Las Vegas; Tysons Corner, 
                Virginia; and Jacksonville, Florida. By 2003, Teavana had grown to 11 mall-based stores.

                In 2004, the company obtained equity capital through a minority investment from Parallel 
                Investment Partners to fund future growth. In 2005, with the help of Parallel, Teavana ﬁ lled 
                out its executive management team, hiring Daniel P. Glennon as CFO; Peter M. Luckhurst 
                as vice president of stores (subsequently executive vice president of operations); and Robert 
                A. Shapiro as vice president of real estate. With a solid executive team in place, Teavana 
                entered a period of rapid growth, opening nearly 130 stores from 2005 through 2010 with 
                no incremental equity capital.

                Since its founding 14 years ago, Teavana has emerged as the leading retailer of premium 
                loose-leaf tea in the United States, with no other comparable retailer having more than four 
                locations. Teavanas stores offer a broad selection of more than 100 premium loose-leaf 
                teas from around the world, composed of roughly 20% single-estate teas and 80% blended 
                and herbal teas (85% of which are proprietary) within seven categories (white, green, 
                oolong, black, rooibos-based blends, maté-based blends, and other herbal-based blends). 
                Merchandise margins are consistent across Teavanas tea categories.

                Stores are located in high-trafﬁ c locations within malls and lifestyle centers, each featuring 
                a sample cart at its entrance to entice customers to try featured teas, as shown in ﬁ gure 1. 
                The overall retail experience is inviting, with blond wood  ﬁ xtures, ceramic tiled ﬂ oors, soft 
                lighting, and Asian-inspired music. Each store features a Wall of Tea behind the sales 
                counter, with the seven categories of tea distinguished by bright, color-coded canisters. 
                Given the importance of newness to its customers, Teavana refreshes approximately 10% 
                to 20% of its Wall of Tea offerings annually.

                    Teavana also offers an appealing selection of tea-related merchandise (more than half of 
                    which is exclusive to Teavana), including teapots, teacups, tea makers, decorative tins, gift 
                    sets, and other tea-related accessories and items. Overall, loose-leaf tea represented 56% 
                    of sales in 2010 (roughly 150 SKUs), followed by tea-related merchandise at 40% (375 SKUs 
                    at price points from $4 to $250) and prepared beverages at just 4% of sales (7 options at

                Teavanas loose-leaf teas range in price from $3 to $40 for two ounces (the minimum amount 
                sold), with single-estate teas generally the most expensive and rooibos-based blends, maté-
                based blends, and herbal-based blends the least expensive. Teavana does not typically raise 
                prices on its existing tea offerings, instead introducing new teas at higher price points with 
                its annual changes to the Wall of Tea. With 2 ounces yielding about 20 to 25 cups of tea on 
                average (depending on strength preference), Teavana provides an affordable indulgence 
                for as little as $0.13 per cup to as much as $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.

                Talent Development Bolsters Reputation as Premium Tea Retailer
                Given the highly interactive nature of engaging and educating customers on tea, Teavana 
                provides extensive training for all store-level employees. Each teaologist (i.e., staff associ-
                ate) receives three weeks of in-store and classroom training, during which time the associate 
                is educated on the different types of tea, the tea-making process, and methods of engaging 
                and informing customers about Teavanas premium tea offerings and related merchandise, 
                with a culmination of three tea tests that must be passed. Assistant managers and general 
                managers receive an additional four weeks of training at the companys store support center. 

                Each store is led by a general manager, an assistant manager, and 2 team leaders who 
                typically oversee 8 to 10 store associates. To ensure strong new store openings, general 
                managers are hired four months in advance of an opening, and team members are hired 
                four weeks in advance, and new-store team members receive on-site training from special-
                ized new-store trainers. Area managers are responsible for roughly 10 stores, while regional 
                directors oversee about 8 area managers (or about 80 stores).

                 Teavanas philosophy of promoting from within has yielded strong employee retention as well 
                 as a pipeline of new talent that bodes well for future store development. In 2010, 87% of gen-
                 eral manager positions were ﬁ lled with internal candidates who were promoted, up from 39% 
                 in 2009 and 15% in 2008, and virtually all general manager positions in 2011 are expected 
                 to be ﬁ lled internally. Moreover, employee turnover has been on a downward trend over the 
                 past few years, with general manager turnover at 18% last year versus 28% in 2008, assistant 
                 general manager turnover at 34% versus 58%, and full-time team member turnover at 48% 
                 versus 64%, while zero turnover has occurred in area manager or regional director positions.

                 In addition, Teavana actively tracks and rewards performance to identify and incentivize 
                 top performers. All positions, including part-time store associates, are eligible for individual-
                 ized performance-based incentive compensation, while managers are incentivized on store 
                 performance versus sales and payroll targets.

                 Supply Chain and Distribution
                 Teavana sources its wide array of loose-leaf tea and tea-related merchandise from more 
                 than 100 vendors worldwide, with its 2 largest vendors representing 25% and 15% of inven-
                 tory purchases in 2010. Tea is sourced directly from tea gardens, blenders, and brokers 
                 in 10 countries, while most tea-related merchandise comes from Asia. Teavana does not 
                 have any long-term contracts with vendors related to supply, price, or exclusivity of its tea, 
                 although the company works with suppliers to create Teavana-branded merchandise for 
                 its stores. However, premium loose-leaf tea is a very fragmented commodity with multiple 
                 harvest seasons and prices that vary greatly depending on the speci ﬁ c type of tea, which 
                 tempers the likelihood of inﬂ ation.

                 Teavanas distribution system for both its retail and e-commerce channels consists of a 
                 single 80,000-square-foot facility in Stratford, Connecticut, which should be adequate to 
                 support growth through ﬁ rst quarter 2013 following the completion of an ongoing three-phase 
                 expansion. The  ﬁ rst two phases have already been completed, with 19,000 square feet 
                 (up 24%) added in April 2011 and an additional 10,000 square feet (up 12%) added in July 
                 2011. The ﬁ nal phase is expected to be completed in July 2012, adding 12,900 square feet. 
                 While the companys lease runs through 2016 (and 2020 for some portions of the facility), 
                 management has commissioned a study to determine long-term distribution needs, includ-
                 ing a further expansion of its existing distribution center or the construction of an additional 
                 facility, potentially on the West Coast.

Impressive Store-Level Returns With Plenty of Room to Expand 

                Teavanas stores generate impressive sales productivity, with average sales per store 
                reaching $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year) and sales per square foot of $994 
                (versus $935 in 2009), among the best of all mall-based retailers. Encouragingly, Teavanas 
                consumer appeal has proved similar across geographic regions, with sales per store fairly 
                consistent across the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consist-
                ing of approximately 25% of locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. California is 
                Teavanas most important state, contributing 14% of sales, followed by Florida at 8%; no 
                other state contributes more than 5% of sales.

                From a store age perspective, each store class from 2004 through 2009 experienced year-
                over-year improvements in average sales per store in 2010, as even older stores continued 
                to post comp gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix actually becomes increasingly 
                more proﬁ table as stores mature, as high-margin tea grows as a percent of sales by 8 to 
                10 percentage points. As shown in ﬁ gure 4, loose-leaf tea grew from 43% of sales in 2006 
                to 56% last year, with all classes of stores selling an increased percentage of loose-leaf tea 
                (tea as a percent of sales at Teavanas oldest stores is in the low-60% range).

                New store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the com-
                pany has easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash investment 
                of $200,000 to $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are anticipated 
                to account for future growth. New stores are expected to generate 25% cash contribution 
                margins and cash-on-cash returns of roughly 75%, with a payback period of about 18 months. 
                On a fully capitalized basis (capitalizing operating leases at eight times), we estimate unit-
                level after-tax returns of more than 25%.  Notably, stores within the $700,000 to $800,000 
                sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.

                      Plenty of Room to Expand Store Base
                      From about 180 company-owned stores across 36 states, managements goal of 500 do-
                      mestic stores appears reasonable, in our opinion. Still, the planned pace of expansion is 
                      aggressive, with the goal of reaching the 500 store target within ﬁ ve years, including 50 new 
                      company-owned stores this year (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).

                      Teavanas stores are located in high-trafﬁ c areas of malls and lifestyle centers, with A and B 
                      malls viewed as the strongest opportunity given the demographics of the brand ($60,000 to 
                      $100,000 household incomes). The real estate team typically looks for an average household 
                      income of more than $50,000, good population density inclusive of owner-occupied hous-
                      ing within 10 miles, a strong daytime work population within 5 miles, and co-tenants such 
                      as Williams-Sonoma, Ann Taylor, and Coach; new stores are targeted at 900 square feet 
                      to 1,000 square feet (although the company has had success with a range of store sizes). 
                      Teavana also has two franchised locations in the United States, although the company has 
                      no plans to expand franchised development domestically.

                Teavana has 17 franchised stores in Mexico through an international development agree-
                ment with Casa Internacional del Te, S.A. de C.V., and the company recently announced 
                a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with Alshaya (a leading franchise 
                operator of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The Cheesecake Factory).  
                We expect Teavana to further explore additional international expansion opportunities via 
                partnerships with franchise operators, although management may choose to open company-
                owned stores in markets such as Canada.

Rapidly Growing Domestic Tea Market

                The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, 
                according to Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 11% from 2004 through 
                2009. We believe that the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to grow, as the United 
                States represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 billion in 2009, with 
                per capita tea consumption well behind many other nations. Encouragingly, Mintel expects 
                the tea market in the United States to continue posting steady growth, projecting an ap-
                proximate 6% compound annual growth rate through 2014.

                The United States lags all other regions of the world in per capita tea consumption (with the 
                exception of Latin America), although per capita consumption in the United States has grown 
                faster than almost every other region over the past ﬁ ve years with a compound annual rate 
                of 2% (according to Euromonitor International)second only to Eastern Europe (which grew 
                at an approximate 4% compound annual rate over the same time frame). The growth in U.S. 
                tea consumption may be reﬂ ective of an increasing appreciation of the healthful qualities of 
                tea, which is virtually calorie-free and has multiple potential health beneﬁ ts (antioxidants to 
                reduce the risk of cancer and polyphenols to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol).

                   Not surprisingly, Asia has the highest per capita consumption at 736 cups4.5 times that 
                   of the United States, and consumption in Western and Eastern Europe is roughly 3 times 
                   higher than that in the United States. Even Canadas tea consumption per capita is more 
                   than twice that of the United States, while the Middle East and Africa also have slightly 
                   higher consumption patterns than the United States.

                       Competitive Environment
                       Although Teavana is the leader in the fragmented specialty tea retail market, the company 
                       competes in the broader tea market against consumer packaged goods companies and spe-
                       cialty beverage companies, such as Starbucks, Peets, and Caribou Coffee. While Teavana 
                       has established a ﬁ rst-mover advantage in the United States with no comparable competitor 
                       having more than four stores, companies such as Starbucks could become more aggressive 
                       in tea in coming years with its Tazo Tea brand (tea is Starbuckss fastest-growing beverage 
                       category), although we believe it is unlikely that Starbucks will replicate the broad selection 
                       and customer service interaction available at Teavana. In addition, Argo Tea has roughly 20 
                       stores across 3 states, catering to tea drinkers with a prepared-beverage focus, although it 
                       also offers premium loose-leaf tea as well as tea-related merchandise.

                       Internationally, Teavana faces tougher competition given more developed tea cultures, as 
                       evidenced by much higher levels of per capita consumption and already-established com-
                       petition. Germany-based TeaGschwendner has more than 130 stores, most of which are 
                       in Germany, while Lupicia Fresh Tea leads the Japanese market with nearly 130 stores. In 
                       addition, Whittard of Chelsea has roughly 70 stores in the United Kingdom, and the Cana-
                       dian market has two established players: DavidsTea, with nearly 50 locations, and Teaopia, 
                       with nearly 40 stores.

Management Team in Place to Lead Growth

                Following a minority investment by Parallel Investment Partners in 2005, Teavana deepened 
                its management team with the addition of a new CFO, vice president of stores, and vice 
                president of real estate, with no senior management turnover since that time.

                Andrew T. Mack, along with his wife, Nancy, founded Teavana in 1997 and serves as chair-
                man and CEO. Before founding Teavana, Mr. Mack held a variety of management positions 
                in the restaurant industry, including at Darden.

                Daniel P. Glennon joined Teavana as CFO in 2005. Previously, Mr. Glennon was a manager 
                at Marakon Associates, a management consulting ﬁ rm, and an auditor at Arthur Andersen LLP. 
                He also served as CFO or vice president of ﬁ nance for three small or early-stage corporations.

                Peter M. Luckhurst  has served as executive vice president of operations since 2010 
                and previously served as vice president for stores from 2005 through 2010. Before join-
                ing Teavana, Mr. Luckhurst served as president of HMV North America, where his career 
                spanned 15 years.

                Juergen W. Link joined Teavana as vice president of distribution in 2005. Mr. Link founded 
                Special Teas, Inc., in 1996 and served as the companys president until 2005, when it was 
                acquired by Teavana.

                Robert A. Shapiro has been Teavanas vice president of real estate since 2005. Before 
                joining the company, Mr. Shapiro was senior vice president of real estate and property 
                development for Zale Corporation. 

Summary of Earnings Drivers

                Historical and projected income statements, balance sheets, and cash ﬂ ows can be found 
                in tables 7 and 8, on pages 19 and 20.

                Strong Projected Sales Growth
                We expect revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to ﬁ ve years, driven by 
                rapid new unit expansion and healthy same-store sales growth in the 3% to 4% range. Do-
                mestic company-owned store expansion will be Teavanas primary source of revenue growth, 
                and we project 50 new stores in 2011 (up 34%), 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%), and 70 new 
                stores in 2013 (up 27%). In addition to mall-based expansion in the United States, we believe 
                potential exists over the longer term to expand Teavanas retail presence outside malls while 
                also growing a more meaningful e-commerce business (about 7% of sales currently) through 
                an increased focus on marketing and promotional initiatives and pursuing more aggressive 
                international retail expansion and opportunities in the premium grocery channel.

                Teavana experienced strong same-store sales gains over the past two years, including 
                a 6.9% increase in 2009 and an 8.7% increase in 2010, as shown in  ﬁ gure 9. Teavanas 
                healthy comp trends have continued so far in 2011, with comps up 6.0% in the ﬁ rst quarter 
                and 6.9% in the second quarter (excluding e-commerce).  We project 3% to 4% quarterly 
                comp gains through the remainder of the year.

                Comps over the past two years have largely been driven by average ticket gains, as transac-
                tion growth has been hampered somewhat by the de-emphasizing of prepared beverages 
                since 2009 (now at 4% of sales, versus 8% to 10% several years ago). Looking forward, we 
                expect comps to be driven by both the introduction of new consumers to Teavana through 
                incremental marketing initiatives as well as the trade-up of existing customers, the latter 
                of which continues to drive average ticket increases.

                 Teavanas operating margin improved dramatically over the past few years, increasing from 
                 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2010, as shown in  ﬁ gure 10. We expect a modest contraction 
                 in operating margin in 2011, re ﬂ ecting the anniversary of gross margin expansion stem-
                 ming from the companys shift to direct sourcing last year (which we estimate  contributed 
                 300 basis points to gross margin) and incremental SG&A investments associated with 
                 the companys new store support center (opened in third quarter 2010), expansion of the 
                 companys distribution center (ﬁ rst half of 2011), and the ongoing buildout of systems and 
                 marketing functions. In addition, we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-margin 
                 merchandise over the holidays this year, which management believes underperformed in 
                 2010 (merchandise seasonally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).

                 Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, 
                 we expect consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more 
                 so in calendar 2013 given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as 
                 stores mature, the beneﬁ ts of increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on ﬁ xed costs. 
                 Over the longer term, we believe operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, 
                 versus 18.8% in 2010.

                 Primarily reﬂ ecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 
                 in 2012 (up 34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).  We expect Teavana will be able to generate 
                 sufﬁ cient cash to support its growth plans, with free cash  ﬂ ow (after capital expenditures) 
                 projected to grow from about $5 million this year to nearly $10 million in 2011 and nearly 
                 $15 million in 2012.

Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects

                 Teavanas stock valuation of 44 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reﬂ ects a premium 
                 to its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers 
                 such as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-
                 income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon 
                 athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-
                 growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As 
                 a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.5 times exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 
                 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers such as Whole 
                 Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.4 to 1.8 times).

                 While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                 premium valuation is justiﬁ ed given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales 
                 trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with 
                 the potential for upside. We are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggres-
                 sive Growth company proﬁ le.

                 Stock ratings, price targets, and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. 
                 uses a three-point system to rate stocks. Individual ratings and price targets (where used)

                 S&P 500, unless otherwise indicated) over the next 12 months. The assessment of expected 
                 performance is a function of near-, intermediate-, and long-term company fundamentals, 
                 industry outlook, conﬁ dence in earnings estimates, valuation (and our valuation methodol-
                 ogy), and other factors. Outperform (O)  stock expected to outperform the broader market 
                 over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M)  stock expected to perform approximately in

               underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not 
               currently rated. The valuation methodologies used to determine price targets (where used) 
               include (but are not limited to) price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with 
               the relevant market), P/E-to-growth-rate (PEG) ratio, market capitalization/revenue multiple, 
               enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash ﬂ ow, and others.

               Company Pro ﬁ le: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth 
               companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more volatile than the overall 
               stock market. Company proﬁ le is a fundamental assessment, over a longer-term horizon, 
               of the business risk of the company relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors 
               assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track 
               record, market leadership, distinctive capabilities); 2) ﬁ nancial proﬁ le (earnings growth rate/
               consistency, cash  ﬂ ow generation, return on investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) 
               other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, con ﬁ dence in 
               long-term growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative 
               to the broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C)  Fundamental risk is approximately 
               in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk 
               is higher relative to the broader William Blair universe.

               The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company proﬁ le as-
               sessments reﬂ ect the opinion of the individual analyst and are subject to change at any time.

               The compensation of the research analyst is based on a variety of factors, including perfor-
               mance of his or her stock recommendations; contributions to all of the ﬁ rms departments, 
               including asset management, corporate  ﬁ nance, institutional sales, and retail brokerage; 
               ﬁ rm proﬁ tability; and competitive factors.

                    We like TEAs 500 store potential Our Teavana real 
                    estate analysis validates managements 500 store 2015 
                    plan (vs. 179 today).  In our universe, TEA has one of 
                    the lowest saturation rates (2011e stores vs. long term 
                    plan) at 39% vs. the 72% average.      

                    steady comp performance We think Teavanas 
                    3% comp plan is achievable given 1) past performance 
                    and 2) our projected new store real estate/demographic 
                    analysis based on AlphaWise data.    

                    and ~260 bp gross margin expansion from 
                    2010-15e.  We think 2015 gross margin can reach 
                    65.5%, driven by positive mix as stores mature.  Older 
                    stores sell more higher-margin loose tea vs. 
                    lower-margin accessories.   

                    Current valuation reflects growth:  At 40x our $0.60 
                    2012e EPS (and 1.4x our 28% long term growth rate), 
                    we think shares largely reflect Teavanas sales and 
                    earnings potential.  We look for 1) a more attractive entry 
                    point or 2) sustained >MSD% same store sales growth.

                    Risks to our call:  (1) Weakening / strengthening                  companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As

                    economy and mall traffic; (2) Increased competition                have a conflict of interest that could affect the 
                    (stores, online); (3) positive margin mix shift fails to           objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors 
                    materialize.                                                       should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a

The retailer is the undisputed leader in its space and               Exhibit 5 
enjoys a premium positioning, which is reinforced by the             Teavana Store: Paramus Park Mall (Paramus, NJ)

We think this could help drive trade-up among existing tea 
drinkers as well as attract new consumers to the beverage.  We 
like Teavanas focus on the healthy lifestyle  the same 
positioning behind Whole Foods and lululemons success.  
TEAs 179 locations are primarily located in shopping malls 
and lifestyle centers.  We think the companys proprietary 
product, education-rich sales environment, and brand 
awareness through its store footprint pose formidable barriers 
to entry.

    •   2Q11 results. On September 2, 2011, TEA reported                     offer greater sales and EPS accretion potential.  
        2Q11 EPS of $0.03.  Net sales rose +36% (to $31.3 
        million).  Same store sales rose 6.9%, driven by a          Risks to our call:  (1) Weakening / strengthening economy 
        9.3% ticket increase.  Transactions declined -1.8%,         and mall traffic; (2) Increased competition (stores, online); (3) 
        inline with TEAs historical range (slightly positive to    positive margin mix shift fails to materialize. 
        slightly negative).

    •       Gross margin increased +223 bp y/y (to 61.1%),            and Stephen Bakke of the Morgan Stanley REIT Research 
        driven by better product margins (direct sourcing) and      team for use of their US mall data. 
        a sales mix shift towards loose tea (58% of 2Q11 
        sales vs. 57% in 2Q10).  SG&A deleveraged 204 bp to 
        49.1% while D&A of $1.4 million remained flattish as a 
        percent of total sales (4.6%).  Higher SG&A costs 
        were due to: 1) new hires (public company transition); 
        2) new store opening and training; 3) infrastructure; 
        and 4) distribution strategy related consulting fees.  
        The operating margin increased +24 bp to 7.4%.  Net 
        income rose 78.5% y/y to $1.0 million.  2Q11s $0.03 
        EPS was vs. LYs $0.02.    

    •       As of September 2, 2011, TEA had 179 
        company-owned stores.  The company is on track up 
        open 50 new locations in FY11.  Total inventory rose 
        82% y/y to $22.7 million.  Teavanas direct sourcing 
        strategy shift (TEA takes possession of goods earlier; 
        was in full force by 3Q10) drove the y/y increase.  
        In-store inventory remained flat vs. LY.  

    •       Management also initiated 2011 and long-term 
        guidance.  For 2011: $160 - $164 million sales (with 
        low- to mid-single digit same store sales) and $0.42 - 
        $0.44 EPS (based on $16 - $16.8 million net income 
        and 38.3 million shares).  Longer-term outlook (from 
        2010 figures): 25% revenue CAGR, +300 bp 
        operating margin expansion, and 30% net income 
        growth.        

    •   International franchise agreement with Alshaya 
        Group.  On September 2, 2011, TEA announced a 
        10-year franchise development program with the 
        Alshaya group of companies for opening stores in 
        Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab 
        Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan.  The first 
        stores are scheduled to open in 2012.  Under the 
        agreement, we expect TEA will receive a percentage 
        of sales (we estimate 5-6%, based on previous 
        industry franchise transactions).  In our view, we 
        believe the franchises could be slightly accretive to 
        2013 sales (not reflected in our model).  While we 
        view the Alshaya agreement positively, we think

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of August 31, 2011) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.

                          Teavanas stock valuation of 41 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reflects a premium to 
                          its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers such 
                          as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-
                          income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon 
                          athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-
                          growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As a 
                          result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.4 times exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 
                          times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers such as Whole 
                          Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.3 to 1.7 times).  
                          While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                          premium valuation is justified, based on its strong growth prospects and historically resilient 
                          sales trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth 
                          with the potential for upside.    

                  Summary and Investment Thesis  
                  Founded in 1997 by current Chairman and CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, Teavana is a 
                  rapidly growing specialty tea retailer, with about 180 domestic mall-based stores across 36 states 
                  (including 2 franchised locations) and 17 franchised stores in Mexico. Featuring a large selection of 
                  loose-leaf premium teas as well as tea-related merchandise, Teavana offers a differentiated and 
                  compelling mall-based experience with its inviting store format and highly trained staff.  
                  Teavanas store base has more than tripled in the past four years, and sales have grown at a 
                  compound annual rate of 38% over the same time frame, inclusive of growth of 38% in 2010 to nearly 
                  $125 million. Loose-leaf tea accounts for 56% of sales; tea-related merchandise, 40%; and prepared 
                  beverages, 4%. Teavanas average ticket is $36 in its stores ($46 excluding beverages) and $55 
                  online, with the company generating about 7% of sales through its e-commerce channel.  
                  Compelling Premium Tea Retailer With Impressive Sales Productivity 
                  Teavanas consumer appeal is illustrated by the companys strong sales productivity of $944 per 
                  square foot in 2010, with consistent performance across geographies. Moreover, Teavana has 
                  experienced positive same-store sales in each of the past five years, with only one quarter of negative 
                  comps (-1.6% in fourth quarter 2008), pointing to the resiliency of consumer demand for Teavanas 
                  products. Given the long shelf life of its products and low markdown levels, Teavanas gross margin 
                  was a healthy 62.9% in 2010, and Teavanas operating margin increased from 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% 
                  in 2010.

                  Teavanas stores feature a Wall of Tea (roughly 100 tins of premium loose-leaf tea), a wide array of 
                  tea-related accessories and items, and highly trained store associates who educate consumers about 
                  Teavanas products and the tea-making process. With premium loose-leaf teas ranging from $3 to $40 
                  for two ounces (the minimum amount sold), Teavana offers an affordable yet premium healthy lifestyle 
                  indulgence, with two ounces yielding an average of 20 to 25 cups of tea translating to less than 
                  $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.  

                  The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, according 
                  to market research firm Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 11% from 2004 through 
                  2009. We believe the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to grow, as the United States 
                  represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 billion in 2009, with per capita tea 
                  consumption well behind many other nations. Encouragingly, Mintel expects the tea market in the 
                  United States to continue to post steady growth, projecting an approximate 6% compound annual 
                  growth rate through 2014.

                   Excellent Store Productivity Yields Consistently Robust Store-Level Returns 
                   Teavana averaged sales per store of $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year), with all classes 
                   of stores (by age) experiencing gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix becomes increasingly 
                   more profitable as stores mature, as the mix naturally shifts toward high-margin loose-leaf tea as a 
                   store ages (also indicative of strong customer loyalty).

                   Encouragingly, Teavanas performance has been remarkably similar across all regions of the country, 
                   including the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consisting of roughly 25% of 
                   locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. Teavanas average four-wall cash contribution margin 
                   was 30% in 2010, with all stores profitable.  

                   New-store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the company has 
                   easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash investment of $200,000 to 
                   $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are expected to account for future growth. 
                   New stores are anticipated to generate 25% cash contribution margins and cash-on-cash returns of 
                   about 75%, with a payback period of roughly 18 months.

          William Blair & Company, L.L.C. 

                  Ample Opportunity for Store Expansion 
                  From about 180 company-owned stores today, we believe that Teavana has the opportunity to nearly 
                  triple its U.S. store base, in keeping with managements goal of reaching 500 domestic stores by 2015. 
                  Should Teavana meet its objectives, it would be one of the fastest-growing publicly traded retailers, 
                  with 50 new company-owned stores expected in 2011 (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).  

                  While Teavanas growth plans are aggressive, we believe they may also be necessary to cement the 
                  concepts first-mover advantage, particularly as others are likely to notice Teavanas highly profitable 
                  model now that the company is publicly traded. We believe there are 500 high-quality domestic malls 
                  that meet Teavanas requirements, and we see the potential for the company to augment its mall-
                  based locations with strategically placed street locations in the future. Teavana also has 17 franchised 
                  stores in Mexico, and we expect the company to explore additional international expansion 
                  opportunities in coming years through company-owned development and/or franchised agreements.  
                  To this point, Teavana recently announced a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with 
                  Alshaya, a leading franchise operator of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The 
                  Cheesecake Factory.  

                  Over the longer term, we believe the Holy Grail would be for Teavana to evolve from a retailer into a 
                  market-defining brand, similar to what Starbucks has achieved over the past 20 years. While such 
                  stories are rare, we see parallels in Teavana bringing its European-style specialty tea retail experience 
                  to the United States to the way Starbucks introduced Americans to Italian-based espresso beverages. 
                  If Teavana can define the tea market in the way that Starbucks has dominated specialty coffee, we 
                  see the potential for meaningful brand extension opportunities in the premium grocery and foodservice 
                  channels (Starbuckss consumer packaged goods business accounted for 17% of its operating profits 
                  in fiscal 2010).  

                  We Expect 30% Annual EPS Growth Over the Next Three to Five Years 
                  We expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% per year will yield annual 
                  revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to five years. We expect a modest 
                  contraction in operating margin in 2011 given incremental infrastructure expenses associated with the 
                  companys new store support center, expansion of the companys distribution center, and the buildout 
                  of systems and marketing functions. In addition, we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-
                  margin merchandise over the holidays this year, a category that management believes 
                  underperformed in 2010 (merchandise seasonally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).  

                  Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, we expect 
                  consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more so in calendar 2013 
                  given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as stores mature, the benefits of 
                  increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on fixed costs. Over the longer term, we believe 
                  operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, versus 18.8% in 2010.  

                  Primarily reflecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 in 2012 (up 
                  34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).  

                  Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects 
                  Teavanas stock valuation of 41 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reflects a premium to its peer 
                  group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers such as Starbucks, 
                  Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-income consumers, such as 
                  Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon athletica. However, Teavanas long-
                  term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily 
                  surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.4 times 
                  exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient 
                  premium retailers such as Whole Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios 
                  of 1.3 to 1.7 times).  

                  While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas premium 
                  valuation is justified given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales trends, and we 
                  expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with the potential for upside. We 
                  are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggressive Growth company profile.

                       Investment Risks  

                       Rate of Store Growth Could Strain Operations 

                       Teavanas plan to expand its domestic company-owned store base from about 180 stores today to 500 

                       stores over the next five years is ambitious and could strain the companys human resources while 

                       potentially damaging its distinctive culture based on extensive training and superior customer service. 

                       In the near term, Teavana plans to open 50 stores in 2011 (up 34%) and 60 stores in 2012 (up 31%), 

                       and we project 70 new stores in 2013 (up 27%). While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to 

                       execute on its plans for new stores, we view the companys ability to successfully open high-volume 

                       new stores as critical to the stocks performance.  

                       New Stores May Not Be as Productive as Existing Store Base 

                       Teavana has achieved sales productivity that is among the highest in mall-based retail. However, as 

                       the company grows, its proportion of A malls will decrease as Teavana enters a wider array of less 

                       productive malls, which could result in average unit volumes declining from current levels. 

                       Management is already handicapping for this potential outcome, modeling new store volumes at 

                       $600,000 to $700,000. Importantly, even at lower volumes, unit-level returns remain healthy, as stores 

                       within this sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.  

                       Reliance on Single Product Category 

                       Teavanas business is concentrated on a single product premium loose-leaf tea and its related 

                       merchandise. Teavanas sales would likely be penalized by any negative news related to the quality or 

                       safety of tea or tea-related products.  

                       Exposure to Mall-Based Traffic Trends and Seasonality of Earnings 

                       Teavanas mall-based real estate strategy renders it susceptible to mall traffic trends. In addition, 

                       Teavana earns the bulk of its earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter of the year, which typically has 

                       roughly twice the revenue of any other quarter and contributes the vast majority of full-year earnings 

                       (75% in 2010). As a result, the company is particularly vulnerable to events that hinder consumer 

                       spending or mall traffic during the holidays. The first quarter is the second-most-profitable quarter for 

                       Teavana, with the second and third quarters only slightly profitable.  

                       Limited Float Post-Deal 

                       Teavana has a limited float following the companys IPO, as founder and CEO Andrew Mack still holds 

                       57% of shares and private-equity investor Parallel Investment Partners holds 19%.

                     Sharon Zackfia attests that 1) all of the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect his/her personal views 
                     about any and all of the securities and companies covered by this report, and 2) no part of his/her compensation was, 
                     is, or will be related, directly or indirectly, to the specific recommendations or views expressed by him/her in this report. 
                     We seek to update our research as appropriate, but various regulations may prohibit us from doing so. Other than 
                     certain periodical industry reports, the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals as deemed appropriate by 
                     the analyst.  

                     Stock ratings, price targets, and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. uses a three-point system to 
                     rate stocks. Individual ratings and price targets (where used) reflect the expected performance of the stock relative to 
                     the broader market (generally the S&P 500, unless otherwise indicated) over the next 12 months. The assessment of 
                     expected performance is a function of near-, intermediate-, and long-term company fundamentals, industry outlook, 
                     confidence in earnings estimates, valuation (and our valuation methodology), and other factors. Outperform (O)  stock 
                     expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M)  stock expected to perform 
                     approximately  in  line  with  the  broader  market  over  the  next  12  months;  Underperform  (U)    stock  expected  to 
                     underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not currently rated. The 
                     valuation  methodologies  used  to  determine  price  targets  (where  used)  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  price-to-
                     earnings multiple  (P/E), relative  P/E  (compared  with  the  relevant  market),  P/E-to-growth-rate  (PEG)  ratio, market 
                     capitalization/revenue multiple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.  

                     Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by 
                     their nature tend to be more volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over 
                     a longer-term horizon, of the business risk of the company relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors 
                     assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track record, market leadership, 
                     distinctive  capabilities);  2)  financial  profile  (earnings  growth  rate/consistency,  cash  flow  generation,  return  on 
                     investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, 
                     confidence in long-term growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative to the 
                     broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C)  Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William 
                     Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk is higher relative to the broader William Blair universe.  

                     The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion 
                     of the individual analyst and are subject to change at any time.  

                     The compensation of the research analyst is based on a variety of factors, including performance of his or her stock 
                     recommendations;  contributions  to  all  of  the  firms  departments,  including  asset  management,  corporate  finance, 
                     institutional sales, and retail brokerage; firm profitability; and competitive factors.
