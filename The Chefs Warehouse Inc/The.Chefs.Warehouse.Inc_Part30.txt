INVESTMENT THESIS 

We believe CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products, but feel the company 
is best characterized as a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a substantial 
growth opportunity lying ahead. While the company is a recent IPO and still establishing a 
reputation with investors, we believe it is already proven in its industry. If you can achieve 
the top market share of specialty foods sold into the New York culinary market, in our 
view, you can replicate it anywhere. Period. There is no market in the US with a larger 
base of menu-driven restaurants, no more diverse culinary offerings, no more challenging 
logistical environment than Manhattan, and no more demanding consumers or food 
palates anywhere in the country, if not the world. With an expertise in leveraging its 
supplier and sourcing relationships throughout the world to ensure a broader, deeper or 
more readily available list of gourmet foods and ingredients than its competition, and 
tangible proof that it can dominate the most challenging market in the US, we believe there 
is ample reason to be comfortable that CHEF can replicate its success in every major 
culinary market in the US. 

Q3 RESULTS 

Third quarter financial results were published last week that met consensus expectations. 
Revenue growth remained robust, with sales rising 20% to $101.7 million. The internal 
growth was 13.3%, down from 17% in Q2, but in line with the year-to-date trend and 
above our forecast of 11.5%. As expected, the Q3 IPO and refinancing led to a GAAP loss in 
the quarter. The loss was $(0.06) vs. our $(0.07) loss forecast, but the key figure was pro 
forma EPS of $0.19, which was in line with consensus while a penny below our $0.20 
forecast. The impact of Hurricane Irene, which impacted over two-thirds of CHEF’s sales 
base during the quarter, was a penny impact to EPS, while higher integration costs 
associated with the Harry Wils acquisition trimmed another penny off the results. The 
quarter was essentially a little stronger than billed, despite broad investor concerns that 
exposure to discretionary restaurant spending and leverage to Wall Street could impair 
results. Coming out of the quarter, we have higher confidence in our growth forecasts, a 
higher expectation of acquisition contribution given the greater retention of Harry Wils 
customers that was achieved by the company boosting spending against the acquisition 
integration, and further confidence in the consistency of gross margins.  

Gross margin continued to expand YOY and run above our long-term based expectation of 
at least 26% margins, coming in at 26.2%. The pro forma operating margin of 6.9% was 
below our forecast of 7.5% given the boosted spending on customer service and 
incremental distribution assets to support the Harry Wils integration. The added 
routes/drivers will normalize during Q4, but we expect the incremental contribution of the 
acquisition to remain. We estimated about $18M of annualized contribution from this most 
recent acquisition, while the actual annualized contribution is running just over $20 
million. We expect operating margins will revert to the trend of YOY expansion in Q4.   

We believe that the Q3 trends are a reflection of a competitive position that should 
continue to deliver market share gains and growth well in excess of the broader food 
service industry. Given higher acquisition integration costs and a hurricane that eliminated 
sales for a short period in its two largest markets, we view the Q3 results very favorably.  

                                                                                            

                                                                                           219

Now that we have had an opportunity to more thoroughly review the Q3 financial results, 
we are updating our forecasts for the Q3 actuals and trends exiting the quarter. We are 
making no change to our forward EPS estimates, while modestly increasing our forward 
revenue projections. Our F2011 EPS estimate falls by a penny to $0.76 from $0.77 to 
reflect the Q3 variance driven by Hurricane Irene impact, while we maintain our F2012 
and F2013 EPS estimates of $0.95 and $1.08, respectively. We are increasing our F2011 
revenue forecast to $392 million from $389 million, mostly due to the Q3 variance, 
compounded by a modest increase to our Q4 estimate. For F2012 and F2013, we are 
increasing our revenue forecasts by just over 1%, to $442 million and $480 million from 
$437 million and $474 million, respectively. Our new forecasts continue to reflect internal 
growth in the low teens this year and a more conservative forecast of high single digits in 
F2012 and beyond. We have increased our Harry Wils contribution to just over $20 million 
annualized from $18 million previously and continue to forecast no future acquisitions in 
our model, despite the near certainty that additional consolidation of the highly fragmented 
specialty food distribution will occur. 

On the margins, we have modestly boosted our gross margin forecast for Q4, while 
increasing our operating expense forecast by a like amount. For the full year of 2011, our

margin forecasts were reduced by the Q3 results. Beyond this year, our margin 
expectations have not been materially changed, other than building off a new base in 
F2011.

VALUATION 

Valuation is attractive, in our view. Shares trade at 15x 2012 our EPS forecast of $0.95 
and 9x forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant premium to the 
food distribution peer group multiple of 11-12x earnings and 6-7x EBITDA, the valuation is 
attractive relative to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth 
United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $37.00 | HOLD). We view UNFI as the best 
comparable for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins 
relative to most distributors (yet at 18% its gross margins are still inferior to CHEF at 26%) 
and is the leader in its segment. The shares trade at a 10%-15% discount to UNFI.  

We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers given 
its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital. Our 
price target of $18.00 equates to 16.5x our 2013 EPS forecast and 9.5x our EBITDA 
forecast. Our targeted PE and EBITDA multiple forecasts reflect the premium valuations of 
the specialty food peer group (twice the valuation of the distribution group), reduced by the 
unattractive comparison to the low valuations afforded the traditional food distribution 
peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target include the 
following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, excessive 
commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, could alter 
consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products sold that have had 
their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in 
fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service establishments, the 
company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer confidence and spending 
fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental economic weakness have impacted 
the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, competition in the 
food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with larger food companies with 
greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural 
Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving the 
Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of CHEF's total 
sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its history and it 
remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution industry is highly 
fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future acquisitions. Future 
acquisitions could strain management resources; result in sales disruptions or loss of key 
personnel and the company may not achieve expected cost reductions or distribution 
gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any concern 
about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the brands sold through 
CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, state and 
local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations require various 
licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory 
requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of specialty food products, CHEF 
is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food 
safety and the sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to profitably 
and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result in its trucks being 
unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary closure or the destruction of one or more 
of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors that can be 
found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.
