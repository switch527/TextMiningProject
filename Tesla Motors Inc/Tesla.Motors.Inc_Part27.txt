North American auto show is a dog and pony show 

We have attended several auto shows in Detroit over the years.  They are 
filled  with  beautiful  cars  that  frequently  have  car  enthusiasts  salivating.  
However, the show is as much a media and social event as it is a way to 
primarily  preview  “concept”  automobiles.    We  expect  Tesla  to  put  on  an 
excellent  show  demonstrating  its  Model  S  sedan.    The  prototype  is  a 
beautiful car.  We still have trouble getting over a few facts though such as 
~1,400 Roadsters built since inception.  And not by Tesla. 
 

Building it from scratch 

Let’s review the strategy again. The current plan for Tesla is to build a low 
volume EV in California.  Originally Tesla was planning to buy a chassis but 
is now building it from scratch.  Yesterday Tesla VP of Engineering Peter 
Rawlinson  walked  through  a  prototype  Model  S  discussing  its  physical 
design and layout, some materials (aluminum body shell), safety features, 
rear suspension, battery placement, low center of gravity and something they 
referred to as “package efficiency”.  What was missing during the discussion 
of all the benefits touted by Mr. Rawlinson was a discussion of cost.  To build 
a car from scratch and manufacture it yourself requires new tooling, designs, 
changes  to  designs  (which  begets  more  new  tooling),  tryouts,  pilot  runs, 
debugging, training etc.  We believe the costs could total $1.5-$2.0Bns since 
also Tesla lacks scale purchasing power of its larger OEMs. Contrast this 
with  General  Motors  which  spent  ~$750M  on the  Chevrolet  Volt since  it 
rides on an existing platform. Tesla has impressively raised over $1Bn to 
date but can it raise another $400M-$1Bn?  To build 20,000 cars annually at 
$50K-$70K per car?  Does that sound like a recipe for success?   
 
Competition is Ramping Up 

We believe the auto show will begin to reinforce how crowded the HEV and 
EV space is becoming.  We count 11 major auto OEMs that will present at the 
show that already offer HEVs and/or will offer an EV before or near the 
same time as Tesla’s Model S.

In addition, outside of the beauty exterior design of the Model S, its extended 
range is its best selling feature.  But is that truly a differentiator? One of the 
primary arguments in favor of EV adoption is that the ~80% of daily car 
usage is under 40 miles and therefore, a lack of range versus conventional 
vehicles  is  largely  negated.    However,  we  find  two  problems  with  that 
argument.  First, there is a decided lack of infrastructure (electric charging 
stations  at  gas  stations)  once  a  user  leaves  their  home.    The  workplace 
infrastructure is not yet available nor is there the retail distribution of fuel as 
for conventional vehicles.  We believe that at a minimum the primary pace 
for charging one’s EV will be the home, and to a lesser extent, the workplace, 
so “range anxiety” is a very real hindrance to EV adoption.  Tesla’s Roadster 
achieves ~245 miles of range on a single charge and one version of the Model 
S is expected to achieve up to 300 miles, which does help mitigate some of 
these  range  limitations  but  at  a  far  higher  price  point  that  conventional 
vehicles.

We  do  not  see  the  fuel  savings  (figure  2)  offsetting  the  dramatic  range 
differences   offered   by   conventional   vehicles   at   similar   price   points.  
Additionally, competing PHEVs and EVs soon to be on the road ahead of the 
mid-range Model S also offer lower prices points and better driving ranges 
(except the Nissan Leaf).

Battery technology – How big is their lead?  How long 
will it last?  

One of the competitive advantages cited by Tesla enthusiast is their lead in 
battery  technology  from  both  a  cost  and  energy  density  perspective.    We 
believe  that  as  the  energy  density  gap  shrinks  major  auto  OEMs  will 
aggressively devote R&D spending to lower battery pack costs and negate 
Tesla’s competitive advantage over the next few years.

Conclusion  –  Use  auto  show  strength  to  add  to  short 
positions or exit long ones 

We believe the auto show will help propel the shares higher but we would 
use the opportunity to revisit why Tesla should command such a premium 
given our concerns regarding  expected production delays/cost overruns, high 
vehicle price, limited addressable market, lack of a brand name and EV adoption 
rate   slower   than   many   anticipate.      At   over   17x   our   2015E   EV/EBITDA 
(discounted 3 years) versus 8.4x its peer group (on 2012E) we believe the stock 
is priced for perfection.  We reiterate our SELL rating and $22 target.

INVESTMENT RISK 

Tesla faces intense competition from established auto OEMs, execution risk 

for   Model   S,   lack   of   widespread   EV   adoption,   potential   reduction   in 

government support and continued operating losses.   

 

VALUATION METHODOLOGY 

We value TSLA using 3 metrics - EV/S, EV/EBITDA and a 5-year DCF. Our 

$22 target price is the average relative multiples and our DCF - using 15x 

terminal EBITDA multiple and 14% WACC.
