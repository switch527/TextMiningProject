    across geographies. Reﬂ ecting strong sales productivity, Teavanas stores generate                  
    healthy returns, with management targeting ﬁ rst-year cash-on-cash returns of about              Valuation
    75% and a payback period of roughly 18 months.                                                   P/E                              81.2x   58.9x   43.9x
                                                                                                          
    Plenty of room to expand store base.  From about 180 company-owned stores                        Trading Data

    Expect 30% annual EPS growth over next three to ﬁ ve years. We expect 25%-                       Return on Equity (CY11E)                      30%

    revenue growth in the high-20% range. We anticipate consistent operating margin 
    improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more so in calendar 2013 given a 
    favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as stores mature as well as 
    leverage on ﬁ xed costs, although infrastructure investments to support growth will 
    likely constrain margins in 2011.

    Aggressive expansion is main risk. We believe that Teavanas main investment 
    risk is its plan for aggressive store expansion, including 50 new company-owned 
    stores this year (up 34%) and 60 new company-owned stores in 2012 (up 31%). 
    While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to execute on its expansion plans, 
    we view the companys ability to successfully open new stores as critical to the 
    stocks performance.

Summary and Investment  esis

                         Founded in 1997 by current Chairman and CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, Teavana 
                         is a rapidly growing specialty tea retailer, with about 180 domestic mall-based stores across 
                         36 states (including 2 franchised locations) and 17 franchised stores in Mexico. Featuring 
                         a large selection of loose-leaf premium teas as well as tea-related merchandise, Teavana 
                         offers a differentiated and compelling mall-based experience with its inviting store format 
                         and highly trained staff.

                         Teavanas store base has more than tripled in the past four years, and sales have grown 
                         at a compound annual rate of 38% over the same time frame, inclusive of growth of 38% 
                         in 2010 to nearly $125 million. Loose-leaf tea accounts for 56% of sales; tea-related mer-
                         chandise, 40%; and prepared beverages, 4%. Teavanas average ticket is $36 in its stores 
                         ($46 excluding beverages) and $55 online, with the company generating about 7% of sales 
                         through its e-commerce channel.

                         Compelling Premium Tea Retailer With Impressive Sales Productivity
                         Teavanas consumer appeal is illustrated by the companys strong sales productivity of 
                         $944 per square foot in 2010, with consistent performance across geographies. Moreover, 
                         Teavana has experienced positive same-store sales in each of the past ﬁ ve years, with only 
                         one quarter of negative comps (-1.6% in fourth quarter 2008), pointing to the resiliency of 
                         consumer demand for Teavanas products. Given the long shelf life of its products and low 
                         markdown levels, Teavanas gross margin was a healthy 62.9% in 2010, and Teavanas 
                         operating margin increased from 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2010.

                Teavanas stores feature a Wall of Tea (roughly 100 tins of premium loose-leaf tea), a wide 
                array of tea-related accessories and items, and highly trained store associates who educate 
                consumers about Teavanas products and the tea-making process. With premium loose-leaf 
                teas ranging from $3 to $40 for two ounces (the minimum amount sold), Teavana offers an 
                affordable yet premium healthy lifestyle indulgence, with two ounces yielding an average 
                of 20 to 25 cups of teatranslating to less than $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.

                The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, 
                according to market research ﬁ rm Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 
                11% from 2004 through 2009. We believe the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to 
                grow, as the United States represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 
                billion in 2009, with per capita tea consumption well behind many other nations. Encourag-
                ingly, Mintel expects the tea market in the United States to continue to post steady growth, 
                projecting an approximate 6% compound annual growth rate through 2014.

                Excellent Store Productivity Yields Consistently Robust Store-Level Returns
                Teavana averaged sales per store of $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year), with 
                all classes of stores (by age) experiencing gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix 
                becomes increasingly more proﬁ table as stores mature, as the mix naturally shifts toward 
                high-margin loose-leaf tea as a store ages (also indicative of strong customer loyalty).

                Encouragingly, Teavanas performance has been remarkably similar across all regions of the 
                country, including the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consisting 
                of roughly 25% of locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. Teavanas average four-
                wall cash contribution margin was 30% in 2010, with all stores proﬁ table.

                New-store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the 
                company has easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash invest-
                ment of $200,000 to $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are expected 
                to account for future growth. New stores are anticipated to generate 25% cash contribution 
                margins and cash-on-cash returns of about 75%, with a payback period of roughly 18 months.

                Ample Opportunity for Store Expansion
                From about 180 company-owned stores today, we believe that Teavana has the oppor-
                tunity to nearly triple its U.S. store base, in keeping with managements goal of reaching 
                500 domestic stores by 2015. Should Teavana meet its objectives, it would be one of the 
                fastest-growing publicly traded retailers, with 50 new company-owned stores expected in 
                2011 (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).

                While Teavanas growth plans are aggressive, we believe they may also be necessary to ce-
                ment the concepts ﬁ rst-mover advantage, particularly as others are likely to notice Teavanas 
                highly proﬁ table model now that the company is publicly traded. We believe there are 500 
                high-quality domestic malls that meet Teavanas requirements, and we see the potential for 
                the company to augment its mall-based locations with strategically placed street locations in 
                the future. Teavana also has 17 franchised stores in Mexico, and we expect the company to 
                explore additional international expansion opportunities in coming years through company-
                owned development and/or franchised agreements.  To this point, Teavana recently announced 
                a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with Alshaya, a leading franchise operator 
                of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The Cheesecake Factory.

                Over the longer term, we believe the Holy Grail would be for Teavana to evolve from a re-
                tailer into a market-deﬁ ning brand, similar to what Starbucks has achieved over the past 20 
                years. While such stories are rare, we see parallels in Teavana bringing its European-style 
                specialty tea retail experience to the United States to the way Starbucks introduced Ameri-
                cans to Italian-based espresso beverages. If Teavana can deﬁ ne the tea market in the way 
                that Starbucks has dominated specialty coffee, we see the potential for meaningful brand 
                extension opportunities in the premium grocery and foodservice channels (Starbuckss con-
                sumer packaged goods business accounted for 17% of its operating proﬁ ts in ﬁ scal 2010).

                       We Expect 30% Annual EPS Growth Over the Next Three to Five Years
                       We expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% per year will 
                       yield annual revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to  ﬁ ve years. We 
                       expect a modest contraction in operating margin in 2011 given incremental infrastructure 
                       expenses associated with the companys new store support center, expansion of the com-
                       panys distribution center, and the buildout of systems and marketing functions. In addition, 
                       we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-margin merchandise over the holidays this 
                       year, a category that management believes underperformed in 2010 (merchandise season-
                       ally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).

                       Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, 
                       we expect consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more 
                       so in calendar 2013 given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as 
                       stores mature, the beneﬁ ts of increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on ﬁ xed costs. 
                       Over the longer term, we believe operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, 
                       versus 18.8% in 2010.

                       Primarily reﬂ ecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 
                       in 2012 (up 34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).

                       Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects
                       Teavanas stock valuation of 44 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reﬂ ects a premium 
                       to its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retail-
                       ers such as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to 
                       higher-income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and 
                       lululemon athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even

                its fastest-growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average 
                of 18%.  As a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.5 times exceeds its peer group 
                average of 1.2 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers 
                such as Whole Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.4 
                to 1.8 times).

                While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                premium valuation is justiﬁ ed given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales 
                trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with 
                the potential for upside. We are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggres-
                sive Growth company proﬁ le. 

Investment Risks

                Rate of Store Growth Could Strain Operations
                Teavanas plan to expand its domestic company-owned store base from about 180 stores 
                today to 500 stores over the next ﬁ ve years is ambitious and could strain the companys hu-
                man resources while potentially damaging its distinctive culture based on extensive training 
                and superior customer service. In the near term, Teavana plans to open 50 stores in 2011 
                (up 34%) and 60 stores in 2012 (up 31%), and we project 70 new stores in 2013 (up 27%). 
                While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to execute on its plans for new stores, we 
                view the companys ability to successfully open high-volume new stores as critical to the 
                stocks performance.

                New Stores May Not Be as Productive as Existing Store Base
                Teavana has achieved sales productivity that is among the highest in mall-based retail. 
                However, as the company grows, its proportion of A malls will decrease as Teavana enters 
                a wider array of less productive malls, which could result in average unit volumes declining 
                from current levels. Management is already handicapping for this potential outcome, modeling 
                new store volumes at $600,000 to $700,000. Importantly, even at lower volumes, unit-level 
                returns remain healthy, as stores within this sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution 
                margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.

                Reliance on Single Product Category
                Teavanas business is concentrated on a single productpremium loose-leaf teaand 
                its related merchandise. Teavanas sales would likely be penalized by any negative news 
                related to the quality or safety of tea or tea-related products.

                Exposure to Mall-Based Trafﬁ c Trends and Seasonality of Earnings
                Teavanas mall-based real estate strategy renders it susceptible to mall traf  ﬁ c trends. In 
                addition, Teavana earns the bulk of its earnings in its ﬁ scal fourth quarter of the year, which 
                typically has roughly twice the revenue of any other quarter and contributes the vast major-
                ity of full-year earnings (75% in 2010). As a result, the company is particularly vulnerable to 
                events that hinder consumer spending or mall traf ﬁ c during the holidays. The ﬁ rst quarter 
                is the second-most-proﬁ table quarter for Teavana, with the second and third quarters only 
                slightly proﬁ table.

                Limited Float Post-Deal
                Teavana has a limited ﬂ oat following the companys IPO, as founder and CEO Andrew Mack 
                still holds 57% of shares and private-equity investor Parallel Investment Partners holds 19%.

Distinctive Premium Loose-Leaf Tea Retailer 

                Teavana was founded in 1997 by CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, as a channel 
                for their passion for tea that they acquired through their worldwide travels. Teavanas  ﬁ rst 
                store opened in Atlanta that year, followed by a second store in Atlanta in 1998 and a third 
                in 2000. In 2001, the couple expanded Teavanas geographic presence with an opening in 
                Minneapoliss Mall of America, followed by openings in 2002 in Las Vegas; Tysons Corner, 
                Virginia; and Jacksonville, Florida. By 2003, Teavana had grown to 11 mall-based stores.

                In 2004, the company obtained equity capital through a minority investment from Parallel 
                Investment Partners to fund future growth. In 2005, with the help of Parallel, Teavana ﬁ lled 
                out its executive management team, hiring Daniel P. Glennon as CFO; Peter M. Luckhurst 
                as vice president of stores (subsequently executive vice president of operations); and Robert 
                A. Shapiro as vice president of real estate. With a solid executive team in place, Teavana 
                entered a period of rapid growth, opening nearly 130 stores from 2005 through 2010 with 
                no incremental equity capital.

                Since its founding 14 years ago, Teavana has emerged as the leading retailer of premium 
                loose-leaf tea in the United States, with no other comparable retailer having more than four 
                locations. Teavanas stores offer a broad selection of more than 100 premium loose-leaf 
                teas from around the world, composed of roughly 20% single-estate teas and 80% blended 
                and herbal teas (85% of which are proprietary) within seven categories (white, green, 
                oolong, black, rooibos-based blends, maté-based blends, and other herbal-based blends). 
                Merchandise margins are consistent across Teavanas tea categories.

                Stores are located in high-trafﬁ c locations within malls and lifestyle centers, each featuring 
                a sample cart at its entrance to entice customers to try featured teas, as shown in ﬁ gure 1. 
                The overall retail experience is inviting, with blond wood  ﬁ xtures, ceramic tiled ﬂ oors, soft 
                lighting, and Asian-inspired music. Each store features a Wall of Tea behind the sales 
                counter, with the seven categories of tea distinguished by bright, color-coded canisters. 
                Given the importance of newness to its customers, Teavana refreshes approximately 10% 
                to 20% of its Wall of Tea offerings annually.

                    sets, and other tea-related accessories and items. Overall, loose-leaf tea represented 56% 
                    of sales in 2010 (roughly 150 SKUs), followed by tea-related merchandise at 40% (375 SKUs 
                    at price points from $4 to $250) and prepared beverages at just 4% of sales (7 options at

                Teavanas loose-leaf teas range in price from $3 to $40 for two ounces (the minimum amount 
                sold), with single-estate teas generally the most expensive and rooibos-based blends, maté-
                based blends, and herbal-based blends the least expensive. Teavana does not typically raise 
                prices on its existing tea offerings, instead introducing new teas at higher price points with 
                its annual changes to the Wall of Tea. With 2 ounces yielding about 20 to 25 cups of tea on 
                average (depending on strength preference), Teavana provides an affordable indulgence 
                for as little as $0.13 per cup to as much as $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.

                provides extensive training for all store-level employees. Each teaologist (i.e., staff associ-
                ate) receives three weeks of in-store and classroom training, during which time the associate 
                is educated on the different types of tea, the tea-making process, and methods of engaging 
                and informing customers about Teavanas premium tea offerings and related merchandise, 
                with a culmination of three tea tests that must be passed. Assistant managers and general 
                managers receive an additional four weeks of training at the companys store support center. 

                Each store is led by a general manager, an assistant manager, and 2 team leaders who 
                typically oversee 8 to 10 store associates. To ensure strong new store openings, general 
                managers are hired four months in advance of an opening, and team members are hired 
                four weeks in advance, and new-store team members receive on-site training from special-
                ized new-store trainers. Area managers are responsible for roughly 10 stores, while regional 
                directors oversee about 8 area managers (or about 80 stores).

                 Teavanas philosophy of promoting from within has yielded strong employee retention as well 
                 as a pipeline of new talent that bodes well for future store development. In 2010, 87% of gen-
                 eral manager positions were ﬁ lled with internal candidates who were promoted, up from 39% 
                 in 2009 and 15% in 2008, and virtually all general manager positions in 2011 are expected 
                 to be ﬁ lled internally. Moreover, employee turnover has been on a downward trend over the 
                 past few years, with general manager turnover at 18% last year versus 28% in 2008, assistant 
                 general manager turnover at 34% versus 58%, and full-time team member turnover at 48% 
                 versus 64%, while zero turnover has occurred in area manager or regional director positions.

                 In addition, Teavana actively tracks and rewards performance to identify and incentivize 
                 top performers. All positions, including part-time store associates, are eligible for individual-
                 ized performance-based incentive compensation, while managers are incentivized on store 
                 performance versus sales and payroll targets.

                 Supply Chain and Distribution
                 Teavana sources its wide array of loose-leaf tea and tea-related merchandise from more 
                 than 100 vendors worldwide, with its 2 largest vendors representing 25% and 15% of inven-
                 tory purchases in 2010. Tea is sourced directly from tea gardens, blenders, and brokers 
                 in 10 countries, while most tea-related merchandise comes from Asia. Teavana does not 
                 have any long-term contracts with vendors related to supply, price, or exclusivity of its tea, 
                 although the company works with suppliers to create Teavana-branded merchandise for 
                 its stores. However, premium loose-leaf tea is a very fragmented commodity with multiple 
                 harvest seasons and prices that vary greatly depending on the speci ﬁ c type of tea, which 
                 tempers the likelihood of inﬂ ation.

                 Teavanas distribution system for both its retail and e-commerce channels consists of a 
                 single 80,000-square-foot facility in Stratford, Connecticut, which should be adequate to 
                 support growth through ﬁ rst quarter 2013 following the completion of an ongoing three-phase 
                 expansion. The  ﬁ rst two phases have already been completed, with 19,000 square feet 
                 (up 24%) added in April 2011 and an additional 10,000 square feet (up 12%) added in July 
                 2011. The ﬁ nal phase is expected to be completed in July 2012, adding 12,900 square feet. 
                 While the companys lease runs through 2016 (and 2020 for some portions of the facility), 
                 management has commissioned a study to determine long-term distribution needs, includ-
                 ing a further expansion of its existing distribution center or the construction of an additional 
                 facility, potentially on the West Coast.

Impressive Store-Level Returns With Plenty of Room to Expand 

                Teavanas stores generate impressive sales productivity, with average sales per store 
                reaching $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year) and sales per square foot of $994 
                (versus $935 in 2009), among the best of all mall-based retailers. Encouragingly, Teavanas 
                consumer appeal has proved similar across geographic regions, with sales per store fairly 
                consistent across the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consist-
                ing of approximately 25% of locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. California is 
                Teavanas most important state, contributing 14% of sales, followed by Florida at 8%; no 
                other state contributes more than 5% of sales.

                From a store age perspective, each store class from 2004 through 2009 experienced year-
                over-year improvements in average sales per store in 2010, as even older stores continued 
                to post comp gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix actually becomes increasingly 
                more proﬁ table as stores mature, as high-margin tea grows as a percent of sales by 8 to 
                10 percentage points. As shown in ﬁ gure 4, loose-leaf tea grew from 43% of sales in 2006 
                to 56% last year, with all classes of stores selling an increased percentage of loose-leaf tea 
                (tea as a percent of sales at Teavanas oldest stores is in the low-60% range).

                New store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the com-
                pany has easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash investment 
                of $200,000 to $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are anticipated 
                to account for future growth. New stores are expected to generate 25% cash contribution 
                margins and cash-on-cash returns of roughly 75%, with a payback period of about 18 months. 
                On a fully capitalized basis (capitalizing operating leases at eight times), we estimate unit-
                level after-tax returns of more than 25%.  Notably, stores within the $700,000 to $800,000 
                sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.

                      Plenty of Room to Expand Store Base
                      From about 180 company-owned stores across 36 states, managements goal of 500 do-
                      mestic stores appears reasonable, in our opinion. Still, the planned pace of expansion is 
                      aggressive, with the goal of reaching the 500 store target within ﬁ ve years, including 50 new 
                      company-owned stores this year (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).

                      Teavanas stores are located in high-trafﬁ c areas of malls and lifestyle centers, with A and B 
                      malls viewed as the strongest opportunity given the demographics of the brand ($60,000 to 
                      $100,000 household incomes). The real estate team typically looks for an average household 
                      income of more than $50,000, good population density inclusive of owner-occupied hous-
                      ing within 10 miles, a strong daytime work population within 5 miles, and co-tenants such 
                      as Williams-Sonoma, Ann Taylor, and Coach; new stores are targeted at 900 square feet 
                      to 1,000 square feet (although the company has had success with a range of store sizes). 
                      Teavana also has two franchised locations in the United States, although the company has 
                      no plans to expand franchised development domestically.

                Teavana has 17 franchised stores in Mexico through an international development agree-
                ment with Casa Internacional del Te, S.A. de C.V., and the company recently announced 
                a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with Alshaya (a leading franchise 
                operator of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The Cheesecake Factory).  
                We expect Teavana to further explore additional international expansion opportunities via 
                partnerships with franchise operators, although management may choose to open company-
                owned stores in markets such as Canada.

Rapidly Growing Domestic Tea Market

                The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, 
                according to Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 11% from 2004 through 
                2009. We believe that the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to grow, as the United 
                States represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 billion in 2009, with 
                per capita tea consumption well behind many other nations. Encouragingly, Mintel expects 
                the tea market in the United States to continue posting steady growth, projecting an ap-
                proximate 6% compound annual growth rate through 2014.

                The United States lags all other regions of the world in per capita tea consumption (with the 
                exception of Latin America), although per capita consumption in the United States has grown 
                faster than almost every other region over the past ﬁ ve years with a compound annual rate 
                of 2% (according to Euromonitor International)second only to Eastern Europe (which grew 
                at an approximate 4% compound annual rate over the same time frame). The growth in U.S. 
                tea consumption may be reﬂ ective of an increasing appreciation of the healthful qualities of 
                tea, which is virtually calorie-free and has multiple potential health beneﬁ ts (antioxidants to 
                reduce the risk of cancer and polyphenols to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol).

                   Not surprisingly, Asia has the highest per capita consumption at 736 cups4.5 times that 
                   of the United States, and consumption in Western and Eastern Europe is roughly 3 times 
                   higher than that in the United States. Even Canadas tea consumption per capita is more 
                   than twice that of the United States, while the Middle East and Africa also have slightly 
                   higher consumption patterns than the United States.

                       Competitive Environment
                       Although Teavana is the leader in the fragmented specialty tea retail market, the company 
                       competes in the broader tea market against consumer packaged goods companies and spe-
                       cialty beverage companies, such as Starbucks, Peets, and Caribou Coffee. While Teavana 
                       has established a ﬁ rst-mover advantage in the United States with no comparable competitor 
                       having more than four stores, companies such as Starbucks could become more aggressive 
                       in tea in coming years with its Tazo Tea brand (tea is Starbuckss fastest-growing beverage 
                       category), although we believe it is unlikely that Starbucks will replicate the broad selection 
                       and customer service interaction available at Teavana. In addition, Argo Tea has roughly 20 
                       stores across 3 states, catering to tea drinkers with a prepared-beverage focus, although it 
                       also offers premium loose-leaf tea as well as tea-related merchandise.

                       Internationally, Teavana faces tougher competition given more developed tea cultures, as 
                       evidenced by much higher levels of per capita consumption and already-established com-
                       petition. Germany-based TeaGschwendner has more than 130 stores, most of which are 
                       in Germany, while Lupicia Fresh Tea leads the Japanese market with nearly 130 stores. In 
                       addition, Whittard of Chelsea has roughly 70 stores in the United Kingdom, and the Cana-
                       dian market has two established players: DavidsTea, with nearly 50 locations, and Teaopia, 
                       with nearly 40 stores.

Management Team in Place to Lead Growth

                Following a minority investment by Parallel Investment Partners in 2005, Teavana deepened 
                its management team with the addition of a new CFO, vice president of stores, and vice 
                president of real estate, with no senior management turnover since that time.

                Andrew T. Mack, along with his wife, Nancy, founded Teavana in 1997 and serves as chair-
                man and CEO. Before founding Teavana, Mr. Mack held a variety of management positions 
                in the restaurant industry, including at Darden.

                Daniel P. Glennon joined Teavana as CFO in 2005. Previously, Mr. Glennon was a manager 
                at Marakon Associates, a management consulting ﬁ rm, and an auditor at Arthur Andersen LLP. 
                He also served as CFO or vice president of ﬁ nance for three small or early-stage corporations.

                Peter M. Luckhurst  has served as executive vice president of operations since 2010 
                and previously served as vice president for stores from 2005 through 2010. Before join-
                ing Teavana, Mr. Luckhurst served as president of HMV North America, where his career 
                spanned 15 years.

                Juergen W. Link joined Teavana as vice president of distribution in 2005. Mr. Link founded 
                Special Teas, Inc., in 1996 and served as the companys president until 2005, when it was 
                acquired by Teavana.

                Robert A. Shapiro has been Teavanas vice president of real estate since 2005. Before 
                joining the company, Mr. Shapiro was senior vice president of real estate and property 
                development for Zale Corporation. 

Summary of Earnings Drivers

                Historical and projected income statements, balance sheets, and cash ﬂ ows can be found 
                in tables 7 and 8, on pages 19 and 20.

                Strong Projected Sales Growth
                We expect revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to ﬁ ve years, driven by 
                rapid new unit expansion and healthy same-store sales growth in the 3% to 4% range. Do-
                mestic company-owned store expansion will be Teavanas primary source of revenue growth, 
                and we project 50 new stores in 2011 (up 34%), 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%), and 70 new 
                stores in 2013 (up 27%). In addition to mall-based expansion in the United States, we believe 
                potential exists over the longer term to expand Teavanas retail presence outside malls while 
                also growing a more meaningful e-commerce business (about 7% of sales currently) through 
                an increased focus on marketing and promotional initiatives and pursuing more aggressive 
                international retail expansion and opportunities in the premium grocery channel.

                Teavana experienced strong same-store sales gains over the past two years, including 
                a 6.9% increase in 2009 and an 8.7% increase in 2010, as shown in  ﬁ gure 9. Teavanas 
                healthy comp trends have continued so far in 2011, with comps up 6.0% in the ﬁ rst quarter 
                and 6.9% in the second quarter (excluding e-commerce).  We project 3% to 4% quarterly 
                comp gains through the remainder of the year.

                Comps over the past two years have largely been driven by average ticket gains, as transac-
                tion growth has been hampered somewhat by the de-emphasizing of prepared beverages 
                since 2009 (now at 4% of sales, versus 8% to 10% several years ago). Looking forward, we 
                expect comps to be driven by both the introduction of new consumers to Teavana through 
                incremental marketing initiatives as well as the trade-up of existing customers, the latter 
                of which continues to drive average ticket increases.

                 Teavanas operating margin improved dramatically over the past few years, increasing from 
                 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2010, as shown in  ﬁ gure 10. We expect a modest contraction 
                 in operating margin in 2011, re ﬂ ecting the anniversary of gross margin expansion stem-
                 ming from the companys shift to direct sourcing last year (which we estimate  contributed 
                 300 basis points to gross margin) and incremental SG&A investments associated with 
                 the companys new store support center (opened in third quarter 2010), expansion of the 
                 companys distribution center (ﬁ rst half of 2011), and the ongoing buildout of systems and 
                 marketing functions. In addition, we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-margin 
                 merchandise over the holidays this year, which management believes underperformed in 
                 2010 (merchandise seasonally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).

                 Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, 
                 we expect consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more 
                 so in calendar 2013 given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as 
                 stores mature, the beneﬁ ts of increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on ﬁ xed costs. 
                 Over the longer term, we believe operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, 
                 versus 18.8% in 2010.

                 Primarily reﬂ ecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 
                 in 2012 (up 34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).  We expect Teavana will be able to generate 
                 sufﬁ cient cash to support its growth plans, with free cash  ﬂ ow (after capital expenditures) 
                 projected to grow from about $5 million this year to nearly $10 million in 2011 and nearly 
                 $15 million in 2012.

Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects

                 Teavanas stock valuation of 44 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reﬂ ects a premium 
                 to its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers 
                 such as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-
                 income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon 
                 athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-
                 growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As 
                 a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.5 times exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 
                 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers such as Whole 
                 Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.4 to 1.8 times).

                 While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                 premium valuation is justiﬁ ed given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales 
                 trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with 
                 the potential for upside. We are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggres-
                 sive Growth company proﬁ le.

William Blair & Company, L.L.C.

               underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not 
               currently rated. The valuation methodologies used to determine price targets (where used) 
               include (but are not limited to) price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with 
               the relevant market), P/E-to-growth-rate (PEG) ratio, market capitalization/revenue multiple, 
               enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash ﬂ ow, and others.

               Company Pro ﬁ le: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth 
               companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more volatile than the overall 
               stock market. Company proﬁ le is a fundamental assessment, over a longer-term horizon, 
               of the business risk of the company relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors 
               assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track 
               record, market leadership, distinctive capabilities); 2) ﬁ nancial proﬁ le (earnings growth rate/
               consistency, cash  ﬂ ow generation, return on investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) 
               other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, con ﬁ dence in 
               long-term growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative 
               to the broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C)  Fundamental risk is approximately 
               in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk 
               is higher relative to the broader William Blair universe.

               The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company proﬁ le as-
               sessments reﬂ ect the opinion of the individual analyst and are subject to change at any time.
