                    and income demographics to support a range of 
                    300-500 Teavana stores domestically (see analysis on 
                    pages 3-4). TEA plans to open 60 stores in 2012 and 
                    reach 500 stores by 2015.  

                    We monitor essential store productivity metrics for 
                    signs of deterioration. Positive 4Q store transactions 
                    (ex e-com and ex-bev) reversed prior negative trends. 
                    However, we do not assume this trend will continue into 
                    2012. Given TEAs early stage growth, we should expect 
                    strong customer acquisition evidenced by transaction 
                    growth and robust comps.

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
