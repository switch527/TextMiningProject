                                       TLLP is a crude oil/refined products pipe       line and storage MLP with visible growth 
                                       prospects, a relatively low risk profile and strategically located assets. The Partnership offers 
                                       an attractive total return value proposition    of 15.5%, comprised of a 5.5% yield (as of 
                                       6/7/11) and 10% expected distribution growth (our 3-year CAGR forecast). Upside 
                                       potential to our growth estimates could come from more immediate asset drop downs from 
                                       parent Tesoro (TSO, $21.88, 2-Equal Weight/3-Negative by Barclays Capital U.S. 
                                       Independent Refiners analyst Paul Cheng). We take a conservative approach and assume no 
                                       drops in 2011 or 2012 and only a $100MM drop in 2013. Long-term distribution growth 
                                       prospects are supported by additional organi c expansion projects in the emerging Bakken 
                                       Shale, including pipeline interconnects to      transport third-party crude oil volumes as 
                                       production in the region is expected to double  over the next five years. TLLP was spun off 
                                       from independent refiner TSO to unlock the        value and provide a growth vehicle for the 
                                       midstream business. TLLP offers an opportunity  for investors to get into the early stages of 
                                       a developing growth partnership  in the relatively stable crude oil/refined products pipeline 
                                       subsector. 

                                       Visible growth prospects 
We believe TLLP is well                An expansive opportunity set to grow the dist      ribution is supported  by organic projects, 
positioned to post 10%                 asset drop downs from the GP, potential thir      d-party acquisitions and increased capacity 
distribution growth (3-year            utilization from being a standalone midstream en  tity (vs. primarily a cost center within a 
CAGR), supported by organic            refiner). It is important to hi ghlight that modest-scale expansion capex is capable of driving 
growth projects, including the         solid accretion given TLLP’s relatively small distributable cash flow base ($46MM) and low 
emerging Bakken Shale, and             cost of capital (approximately 6%). Near term, TLLP has ample financial flexibility with 
asset drop downs.                      $100MM of borrowing availability on its $150MM revolver, enabling financing of initial 
                                       expansion capex without having to raise equity, which drives accretion. 

                                       We believe TLLP is well positioned to post 10% distribution growth (3-year CAGR), 
                                       supported by organic growth projects, including the emerging Bakken Shale and asset drop 
                                       downs. Near-term growth is visible with five small but high-return organic projects (High 
                                       Plains crude gathering and terminal expansions  in Burley, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and

                                    Organic Projects 
                                    Over the next 12 months, TLLP is expected to   complete five projects with a total cost of 
                                    $15.5MM and expected EBITDA of $10.5MM or a very attractive 1.5x multiple. The existing 
                                    organic projects would generate EBITDA growth of 18% vs. LTM 1Q12.  

                                    High Plains (Bakken) crude gath ering expansion.  Of the existi ng five organic projects, the 
                                    Bakken expansion is expected to generate the most cash flow at $6MM or approximately 
                                    60% of the $10.5MM of EBITDA from the projec ts. The $6.6MM High Plains expansion will 
                                    add pumping, tankage and truck unloading capa city related to TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan, 
                                    ND refinery expansion.  

                                    In terms of TLLP’s other current projects, the  Burley, ID and Salt Lake City, UT terminals will 
                                    add ethanol blending. Total project cost is  $2.4MM with expected EBITDA of $1.5MM. At 
                                    the Stockton, CA terminal, TLLP will add 8,000 bpd of storage capacity to gain more of 
                                    TSO’s throughput volumes. The $4.5MM projec       t is expected to generate EBITDA of 
                                    $2.6MM.  At its Los Angeles, CA terminal, TLLP  will add transmix transportation capability 
                                    to serve TSO’s Los Angeles refinery. The $2MM pr oject is expected to generate EBITDA of 
                                    $0.4MM.   

                                    Acquisitions 
                                    We believe another leg of TLLP’s growth stool is asset drop down opportunities from parent 
                                    TSO. TLLP has right of first offer on TSO’s midstream assets for 10 years. While timing of 
                                    drop downs is uncertain, we estimate the probability of drop downs is high given TSO’s 
                                    incentive to maximize shareholder value by se lling midstream assets to the tax-advantaged 
                                    MLP while also receiving distributions as the  owner of the general partner and 50% of the 
                                    limited partner units.  

                                    In terms of the size of the drop down opportunity set, TLLP has not provided a market value 
                                    or EBITDA estimate. While a blunt instrument,  the book value estimate of midstream assets 
                                    at TSO is $240MM vs. $193MM book value of a ssets currently in TLLP. On a rough basis, 
                                    we estimate market value of potential   dropdowns at $500MM and EBITDA of $50MM-
                                    $63MM (assuming 8-10x multiple), roughly double TLLP’s expect forward 12-month 
                                    EBITDA. 

                                    We conservatively estimate TLLP dropdown schedule at $0 in 2011, $0 in $2012, $100MM 
                                    in 2013, $125MM in 2014 and $150MM in 2015. However, we would not be surprised if a 
                                    drop to TLLP occurred in 2012 or even late 2011.

                                        While third-party acquisitions are also a possibi lity for TLLP, we expect the Partnership to 
                                        focus on organic projects and drop downs over  the next few years, as that opportunity set 
                                        supports 10% plus distribution CAGR.  

                                        Potential for increased capacity utilization 
                                        As a standalone midstream company, TLLP has             potential to increase asset utilization by 
                                        increasing TSO and third-party volumes on its  crude oil gathering and terminalling assets. 
                                        For example, TLLP could add third-party volumes on its High Plains crude gathering system 
                                        in the Bakken. In addition,      the Partnership has room to increase TSO volumes at its 
                                        California and Washington state refined prod        ucts terminals and third-party volumes at 
                                        other terminals. 

                                        Relatively low risk profile 
Approximately 84% of TLLP               TLLP has a relatively low risk profile due its st  able, fee-based cash flow stream backed by 
revenues are backed by                  long-term minimum volume commitments from TSO. Approximately 84% of TLLP revenues 
minimum pipeline and storage            are backed by minimum pipeline and storage volume commitments from TSO. Stability is 
volume commitments from TSO.            underpinned by 10-year contracts (except trucking with 2 years) that provide minimal direct 
                                        commodity price exposure (nearly 100% fee-based revenue) and inflation protection (fees 
                                        adjusted by PPI, CPI). The High Plains truck gathering contracts was set at 2 years to benefit 
                                        from expected higher rates due to a ramp in Bakken crude production.

                                    Reasonable business mix and geographic diversification for a young partnership 
                                    While TLLP currently lacks customer mix diversification, with TSO comprising 
                                    approximately 95% of revenues, TLLP does ha       ve asset and geographic diversification. 
                                    TLLP’s five business lines comprise a divers ified revenue mix -- Terminalling 35%, Pipeline 
                                    Gathering 28%, Truck Gathering 25%, Short-Haul Pipeline Transportation 6% and Storage 
                                    6% of sales. On geographic footprint, TLLP   assets are integrated with TLLP refining and 
                                    marketing activities. TLLP assets are locate  d in seven states -- North Dakota, Montana, 
                                    California, Idaho, Utah, Washington, and Alaska.  

                                    Low financial leverage 
                                    TLLP has low leverage with Debt/EBITDA of 1x. In addition, the Partnership has $100MM of 
                                    borrowing availability on its $150MM revolver, which is more than adequate to fund 
                                    $10MM of current organic growth projects over the next 12 months and a potential drop 
                                    down. The Partnership borrowed $50MM under the  revolver at the close of IPO to fund a 
                                    cash distribution to TSO (in addition to     $280MM of IPO proceeds) to pay for the 
                                    contributed assets and capex. The $150MM revolver is expandable to $300MM, matures 
                                    April 25, 2014 and allows a maximum Debt/EBITDA of 4.5x. As TLLP ramps up expansion 
                                    with drop downs or additional growth projec ts, we would expect normalized Debt/EBITDA 
                                    in the 3x range.

TLLP’s High Plains system is        TLLP’s asset base is well positioned in bo  th the emerging Bakken Shale (North Dakota, 
strategically located not only      Montana) and western US. We believe the Partnership’s key asset is its Bakken (High Plains) 
because of its footprint in the     crude oil gathering system. The Bakken is a prolific region poised for continued strong 
emerging Bakken but also as the     production growth due to an 83% YoY increase in proved crude oil reserves to 1.058 billion 
only crude oil supply source for    barrels (according to EIA). Driven by technologica l advances in horizontal drilling, fracturing 
the only refinery in North Dakota,  and completion, North Dakota crude produc tion increased 78% from 2008-2010 (175,000 
TSO’s Mandan refinery.              to 307,000 bpd) and is expected to more than double to approximately 700,000 bpd in the

                                        Research Associates forecast). TLLP’s High Pl ains system is strategically located not only 
                                        because of its footprint in the emerging Bakken  but also as the only crude oil supply source 
                                        for the only refinery in North Dakota, TSO’        s Mandan refinery. The   High Plains system 
                                        volume growth is also supported by the Mandan refinery’s 10,000 bpd expansion to 68,000 
                                        bpd by 2Q12. In addition, the High Plains sy        stem has growth opportunities from adding 
                                        third-party volumes through pipeline interconnects.

                                        Other potential growth opportunities in the Ba kken include increasing High Plains pipeline 
                                        volumes by adding pumping capacity or building new gathering lines and building a rail 
                                        facility at the Mandan refinery to transport crude (beyond Mandan’s 68,000 bpd capacity in 
                                        2Q12) markets outside ND. In the Western US, TLLP’s terminals and pipelines benefit from 
                                        integration with TSO’s refining and marketin  g operations and more stringent regulatory 
                                        climate (California, Washington) that acts as a potential barrier to entry from competitors. 

 

TLLP deserves a premium 
                                       Attractive total return valuation proposition 
valuation vs. MLP peers due to 
its visible growth prospects,          TLLP offers (as of 6/7/11 close) an attrac        tive total return value proposition of 15.5%, 
Bakken exposure, asset drop            comprised of 5.5% yield and 10.0% growth (3  -year CAGR forecast), which is above peer 
down potential, low cost of            average total return of 11.5% and our MLP coverage universe of 12              .0%. Because of its 
capital and high cash flow             higher expected growth rate, nearly double peer average, TLLP trades at a premium to peers 
stability.                             on both a yield and EV/Adjusted EBITDA basis.  In terms of yield, TLLP trades a 5.5% yield 
                                       vs. peer yield of 6.2% and our MLP coverage          universe of 6.6%. On EV/Adjusted EBITDA 
                                        (2011e/2012e) basis, TLLP trades at 16.9x/14.4x vs. 14.4x/12.8x peers and 13.1x/11.5x 
                                        MLP universe. In terms of distribution covera  ge, TLLP is in line with peers at 1.1x. Our 
                                        coverage universe coverage is a little higher      at 1.2x due to commodity-exposed names 
                                        needing to keep higher coverage due to hi            gher cash flow volatility vs. fee-based 
                                        crude/refined product names. 

                                        We believe that TLLP deserves a premium valu ation vs. MLP peers due to its visible growth 
                                        prospects, Bakken exposure, asset drop down po tential, low cost of capital and high cash 
                                        flow stability. In addition, TLLP offers exposure to the early stages of a developing growth 
                                        partnership in the relatively stable crude oil/refined products pipeline subsector.

                                    Investment case $28 price target 
                                    Our $28 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $1.48 and a target yield 
                                    of 5.3%. Based on our price target, TLLP offers  an attractive implied 12-month total return 
                                    is 18.8% vs. 15.3% peer average. Our distribution estimate and yiel  d are predicated on a 
                                    10% distribution growth CAGR driven primarily by organic projects and an asset drop down 
                                    in 2013. 

                                    Upside case $32 valuation 
                                    In an upside scenario, we believe TLLP could  exceed our distribution  growth estimate with 
                                    an asset drop down or third-party acquisit   ion within the next 12 months. Assuming a 
                                    $100MM transaction at an 8x multiple would imply a 12-month price target of $32 per unit. 
                                    The $32 valuation would be based on a 12-month forward distribution estimate of $1.58 
                                    (up from $1.48) and target yield of 5% (mod est compression from 5.3%) due to accretion 
                                    from a $100MM acquisition at 8x multiple. 

                                    Downside case $23 valuation 
                                    In a downside scenario, we estimate a 12-month price target of $23 per unit. Downside 
                                    potential could come from a higher target yi  eld, due to the market demanding a higher 
                                    equity risk premium due to macro conditions  and/or TLLP not achieving expected returns 
                                    on current growth projects. A $23 valuation could be based on a 12-month distribution 
                                    estimate of $1.38 (down from $1.48) and a target yield of 6% (expansion from 5.3%). 

                                    Tax Deferral 
                                    TLLP’s distribution is approximately 80% tax  deferred. That means of the current $1.35 per 
                                    unit distribution, a unitholde  r would pay ordinary income taxes on $0.27 (20% of 
                                    distribution), with the remaining $1.08 (80% of distribution) reducing a unitholder’s basis. 
                                    The 80% tax deferral level is in line with th e MLP sector and represents an important 
                                    component of the value proposition.

                                   Tesoro Logistics Overview 

                                   Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) is a crude oil/   refined product pipeline and storage MLP, 
                                   headquartered in San Antonio, that was spun-o ff from independent refiner Tesoro (TSO) in 
                                   April 20, 2011 IPO. In the transaction, 14.95MM units were issued at $21 per unit (with a 
                                   6.4% yield). TLLP was created to facilitate   the growth of TSO’s midstream business and 
                                   unlock value through the tax-advantaged MLP st ructure. TSO owns a 52% interest in TLLP, 
                                   comprised of a 50% LP and 2% GP interest. TSO owns 15.255MM subordinated units, 
                                   304,890 common units and 622,649 general partner units. The public owns a 48% LP stake, 
                                   with 14.95MM common units. TLLP midstream assets are integrated with TSO’s refining 
                                   and marketing business. The Partnership’s asse ts are comprised of a crude oil gathering 
                                   system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in  ND and MT, 8 refined products terminals in 
                                   the midwest and western US and a crude oil/re  fined products storage facility and short-
                                   haul pipelines in Utah. TLLP has two op      erating segments, crude oil gathering and 
                                   terminalling, transportation, storage. Re venue mix is 53% crude oil gathering/47% 
                                   terminalling, transportation, storage. TLLP  has long-term take-or-pay contracts with TSO 
                                   for minimum volume commitments in both se gments, comprising 84% of total revenues. 
                                   The remaining 16% of revenues is from TSO  volumes beyond the minimum level and third

                                    Crude Oil Gathering  
                                    The Crude Oil Gathering segment accounts fo      r approximately 53% of our estimate for 
                                    TLLP’s 2011 EBITDA. The segment’s asset is th  e High Plains system, which gathers and 
                                    transports crude produced in the emerging  Bakken Shale (North Dakota and Montana) to 
                                    TSO's Mandan, ND refinery. The High Plains  system is comprised of a 700-mile, 70,000 bpd 
                                    capacity pipeline system (plus related storage) and 23,000 bpd of truck-based crude 
                                    gathering. Currently, the only destination   point for the High Plains pipeline and truck 
                                    volumes is TSO’s Mandan refinery. However, TLLP  is exploring ways to diversify its revenue 
                                    stream by adding third party shippers and interconnects with non-TSO pipes. There are five 
                                    potential pipeline interconnects – Enbridge pipe  at Portal and Ramburg, ND, Little Missouri 
                                    pipe at Fryburg, ND, Belle Fourche pipe at Frit z, ND, Bridger pipe at Richey, MT. Integration 
                                    with the Mandan refinery is a positive for TLLP, as TSO is currently in the process of 
                                    expanding refining capacity by 10,000 bpd to 68,000 bpd by 2Q12, which provides visible 
                                    growth for the High Plains system. 

                                    Crude Oil Gathering segment revenue mix is 53% pipelines and 47% truck gathering. 
                                    Approximately 81% of segment revenue is        derived from contracted minimum volume 
                                    commitments with the parent. TSO’s required minimum crude oil volumes of 49,000 bpd on 
                                    the High Plains pipeline and 22,000 bpd on trucks represent 84% and 96% of pipe and truck 
                                    volumes, respectively. In terms of volume gr    owth, pipeline throughput is expected to 
                                    increase 14% (from 2010 average to LTM 1Q12) to 58,000 bpd. Trucking volumes are 
                                    expected to remain relatively flat. Importantly,  High Plains pipeline  and trucking fees have 
                                    inflation protection. Pipeline tariffs are adju sted annually by the FERC PPI+2.65% inflation 
                                    escalator (which will total 7% starting July 1) and the trucking rates are adjusted by the CPI.

                                    Terminalling/Transportation/Storage 
                                    The segment accounts for approximately 47%   of our estimate for TLLP’s 2011 EBITDA. 
                                    Assets include eight refined products terminal s in the midwest and western US, five short-
                                    haul Utah intrastate pipelines and a crude oil/ refined products storage facility. The eight RP 
                                    terminals have truck and barge delivery capacity of 229,000 bpd. The terminals primarily 
                                    distribute production from TS O’s refineries in Los Angeles   and Martinez, CA; Kenai, AK; 
                                    Mandan, ND; Salt Lake City, UT; and Anacortes, WA.  

                                    In addition, TLLP owns and operates pipes an  d storage that exclusiv ely serve TSO’s Salt 
                                    Lake City refinery. TLLP’s Salt Lake City pipe  assets include including three short-haul crude 
                                    oil supply pipelines and two short-haul refi ned product delivery pipelines connected to 
                                    third-party interstate pipelines. The Salt   Lake City terminal has 878,000 barrels of 
                                    crude/refined products capacity.  

                                    Segment revenue mix is 75% terminals,           13% transportation,   and 12% storage. 
                                    Approximately 87% of segment revenue is        derived from contracted minimum volume 
                                    commitments with the parent. TSO’s required minimum volumes represent 
                                    86%/80%/100% of terminal/ transportation/sto rage revenues, respectively. Terminalling 
                                    volumes are expected to increase 1.1% (from 2010 average to LTM 1Q12) to 115,200 bpd, 
                                    while transportation volumes are expected to increase 8.5% to 65,800 bpd. Storage volume 
                                    at the Salt Lake City terminal will remain at 878,000 barrels. Similar to the crude oil 
                                    gathering segment, terminalling, storage and tr ansportation fees have inflation protection, 
                                    via CPI adjustment. 

                                    Overview of General Partner 

                                    Tesoro Corporation (TSO) is the general part  ner of TLLP. TSO is a leading independent 
                                    refiner in the U.S. with 665,000 bpd of refining capacity at seven refineries. Geographic 
                                    footprint is primarily western US. Its seven refi neries are located in AK, CA(2), HI, ND, UT 
                                    and WA. In addition, TSO’s retail segment is comprised of 880 branded retail stations under 
                                    the Tesoro®, Shell®, USA GasolineTM and Mirastar® brands.  

                                    For views on TSO, we defer to our equity and  fixed income research analysts covering the 
                                    name. Barclays Capital Integrated Oil and Inde pendent Refining equity analyst Paul Cheng’s 
                                    view on TSO is constructive.  According to the 5/6/11 note titled “Solid 1Q11, Underlying 
                                    Earnings Power Has Been Improving Over the Las t Couple Years,” Cheng states “in the near 
                                    term, we remain cautious on the refiners and th ink that US refiners’ profit margins could be 
                                    weak in the coming months        as light/heavy differentials  and the WTI/Brent spread 
                                    deteriorate while the product crack could remain  relatively sluggish. However, we think the 
                                    California refining market’s me dium to longer term outlook remains bright given its high 
                                    barriers of entry due to its strict product en  vironmental standard and the lack of pipeline 
                                    capacity to effectively import product from the Gulf Coast or other U.S. markets from a cost 
                                    perspective. We are also impressed by the company’s underlying improvement in its margin 
                                    capture rate over the last couple years. In  addition, we think TSO has more potential room 
                                    for efficiency improvement compared to its p eers due to its relative weak performance in 
                                    the past.”

                                    Stromberg has a Market Weight recommend           ation on TSO’s bonds. According to

                                      quarter-end, the company received ~$330mn in net proceeds from the Tesoro Logistics 
                                      IPO, and redeemed the $150mn of outstandin  g junior subordinated notes due 2012. Pro 
                                      forma these transactions, we estimate net levera ge to decline to 1.0x, from 1.3x at quarter-
                                      end.” A quick look at TSO's bonds indicates stability as the 6.6% senior notes due 2015 are 
                                      trading at 103 vs. 92 on 6/3/10. Net/net, we vi  ew TSO as a stable customer of TLLP and 
                                      posing little counterparty risk.

                                       TLLP has a standard general partner incentive distribution rights           (IDR) structure of 
                                       2/15/25/50%. Currently, the Partnership is IN the 2% GP split, which results in a low 
                                       adjusted cost of equity capital of approxim      ately 5.55% (as of 6/3/11 close), which is 
                                       favorable for financing future expansion pr       ojects. Based on our distribution growth 
                                       estimates, which includes an assumption of $375MM in acquisitions in total through 2015, 
                                       we estimate TLLP will enter the 50% splits in late 2015.  

                                       Risks 

                                       Customer concentration 
                                       Parent TSO comprises approximately 95% of TLLP’s revenues. However, young 
                                       partnerships generally have a limited customer mix. In our view, this is not a significant 
                                       problem, given TSO is a stable customer (S&P credit rating of BB+ with stable outlook). Over 
                                       time, we expect TLLP to increase third party volumes on its crude oil gathering and 
                                       terminalling businesses throug h organic expansions, acquisit ions, and increased capacity 
                                       utilization. 

                                       Limited track record as MLP 
                                       While its assets were previously housed in  TSO, a C-corp independent refiner, TLLP has a 
                                       limited operating track record as a public MLP, with an IPO in April 20, 2011. 

                                       Taxes 
                                       Removal of MLP tax-advantaged status would   negatively impact TLLP growth prospects. 
                                       We expect MLP tax status to  remain unchanged. In fact, the  definition for MLP qualifying 
                                       income was expanded in 2008 for renewable fuels. Nevertheless, the federal government is 
                                       seeking to review the tax code and there is      potential (or at least headline risk) for pass-
                                       through entity tax status to change.  

                                       Interest rates 
                                       TLLP has interest rate exposure from its        revolving credit facility. A 100 bps increase 
                                       (annualized) in interest rates would increase   TLLP interest expense by $0.5MM or 1% of 
                                       2011e distributable cash flow. In addition, MLP valuations could be impacted by rising 
                                       interest rates similar to bond s. However, unlike bonds, MLP distribution growth somewhat 
                                       offsets higher interest rates.

                                   Equity capital markets 
                                   TLLP’s ability to grow distributions relies on access to external capital. We assume the 
                                   Partnership retains approximately 10% of free cash flow, which means TLLP will finance the 
                                   majority of future expansion ca pital expenditures with debt an d equity capital. As such, a 
                                   higher cost of capital could likely lower TLLP’s distribution growth rate.  

                                   Refined product demand 
                                   While having minimal direct commodity price ex posure, TLLP does have indirect exposure 
                                   as high commodity prices would likely reduce refined product demand. Other potential 
                                   sources of lower demand include weak econom ic conditions, competition from renewable 
                                   substitutes and adverse weather conditions. 

                                   Crude oil production 
                                   Given the High Plains system is a key growth driver for TLLP, the Partnership has exposure 
                                   to crude oil production in the Bakken. Lo  wer-than-expected Bakken production growth 
                                   could impact TLLP’s transportation expansion plans in the region.    

                                   Refinery maintenance 
                                   Unplanned refinery downtime could negatively  impact TSO’s excess volumes, beyond the 
                                   contracted minimum levels, on TLLP’s system.  

                                   Acquisitions 
                                   There is a risk that future TLLP acquisitions fail to meet accretion expectations due to 
                                   integration or valuation risks. 

                                   Regulatory and environmental 
                                   More stringent environmental regulations coul d increase TLLP operating costs and reduce 
                                   growth prospects if higher costs were not able to be passed along to customers. 

                                   Management Team 

                                   TLLP has an experienced management team, av eraging 27 years of experience. In addition, 
                                   TLLP recently added two independent boar d members. On 5/24/11, Tom O’Connor and 
                                   Mary Morgan joined TSO’s board as independ ent directors. The addition increases TSO’s 
                                   board from five to seven members and inde      pendent directors from one to three. A

For current important disclosures, including, where relevant, price target charts, regarding companies that are the subject of  this research report,
please send a written request to: Barclays Capital Research Compliance, 745 Seventh Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10019 or r            efer to

Barclays Capital produces a variety of research products including, but not limited to, fundamental analysis, equity-linked ana lysis, quantitative

Primary Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price) 
Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 07-Jun-2011, USD 24.42), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating  system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect    or (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which rate the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive, 2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted  expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12 -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i     n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. 
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "sector coverage universe":
