                                               Executive Summary 

                                               The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.  (“Chefs’”)  is  one  of  the  largest  specialty  food 
                                               distributors    in    the    U.S.,    largely  serving  upscale    independent    menu 
                                               restaurants, fine hotels and clubs. The company offers  over 11,500 unique items 
                                               many of which are premium products. From hard to get olive oil from Italy to unique 
                                               cheese from France, the company caters to and is counted on by the most discerning 
                                               chefs. Founded in 1985, with its origins as a dairy distributor in the New York City metro 
                                               market, Chefs’ currently operates in six major markets, including New York, Los Angeles, 
                                               San   Francisco,   Las   Vegas,   Washington   D.C.   and   Miami,   but   also   services   Boston, 
                                               Philadelphia and Napa Valley. 

                                               We are initiating coverage on The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF) with a Buy 
                                               rating and a 12-month price target of $17.50. Significant opportunity exists for 
                                               Chefs’ to drive higher sale/earnings as it flexes its technology platform, the benefits of 
                                               which remain in very early innings, and combines this with its superior product offering, 
                                               unique  sales  force,  and  limited  buyer  and  supplier  power.  Further,  we  believe  the 
                                               company will work to consolidate this fragmented industry, potentially transforming a 
                                               cottage industry into its own estate. 

                                               The application of technology should drive growth and lower costs. Indeed, as 
                                               Chefs’ Warehouse applies best practices and leverages the benefits of its sales, warehouse 
                                               and distribution technology systems, the company should be able to drive better organic 
                                               growth and lower costs. The company’s CRM and price optimization technology should 
                                               help Chefs’ increase placements/customer and new customers, while also allowing Chefs’ 
                                               to better manage gross profit/customer. This, combined with the completion of the full 
                                               rollout of its warehouse management system by 1Q12, should help reduce costs and lead 
                                               to improved margins and earnings, especially in regions outside of New York. Every 1% in 
                                               sales growth adds just under ½ penny in EPS per quarter, while every 10 bps in better 
                                               margin adds roughly $0.01 annually, according to our estimates. 

                                               There  is  ample  opportunity  for  accretive,  tuck-in,  acquisitions.  Given  the 
                                               fragmentation of Chefs’ industry sub-sector, one that is largely dominated by a myriad of 
                                               less sophisticated, regional or mom and pop operators, there exist significant prospects to 
                                               expand  Chefs’  distribution  reach  through  acquisition.  Many  of  these  transactions  are 
                                               largely purchases of customer lists, lowering integration risk, while providing increased 
                                               share in its current markets as well as expansion in new geographies. We expect that most 
                                               of these purchases will be relatively small, $10-$30 million in revenues, and be nicely 
                                               accretive as they should be done at 2-4x EBITDA. 

                                               Limited  industry  buyer  and  supplier  power,  coupled  with  Chefs’  superior 
                                               product   offering   and   uniquely   positioned   sales   force   should   allow   the 
                                               company   to   capture   excess   profits.  Unlike  certain  other   segments   of   food 
                                               distribution, Chefs’ faces limited buyer or supplier power risk, as its top ten customers 
                                               account for under 10% of net revenue and no supplier accounts for more than 5% of its 
                                               products.  In addition,  Chefs’  also  carries over 11,500 SKUs, an amount roughly 7x  its 
                                               typical competitor and provides a much broader range of specialty products, while also 
                                               offering  many  everyday  staple  items  (flour,  sugar,  butter)  as  well.  Finally,  Chefs’  125 
                                               person sales force is uniquely positioned, as most are culinary educated or have spent 
                                               significant time in the culinary industry.

                                               Chefs’,  we  believe,  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  invest  in  the  faster-
                                               growth,  high-end  consumer  segment  in  the  food-away-from-home  channel 
                                               that is driven by the wealthy and educated consumer. Indeed, as exhibited nicely 
                                               by Whole Foods (WFM, $63.11, Hold), United Natural Foods (UNFI, $38.27, Hold) and 
                                               The Fresh Market (TFM, $36.21, NC), among others, the high-end consumer segment has 
                                               exhibited very strong growth coming out of the 2008 downturn and continues to show 
                                               resilience.  With  a  correlation  of  0.80  between  Chefs’  organic  growth  and  household 
                                               wealth, similar to the correlation exhibited by Whole Foods according to our calculations, 
                                               Chefs’  customers  clearly cater  to  the higher-end  demographic and,  as a result,  recent 
                                               stock market gyrations are a concern. However, our research has shown little slowdown 
                                               in trends, although we have built much lower organic growth into our model in the back 
                                               half of 2011. If this does not materialize, EPS could exceed our current estimate with every 
                                               1%  in  sales  equal  to  just  under  ½  penny  in  earnings  per  quarter,  according  to  our 
                                               estimates. 

                                               Valuation 

                                               Our  price target of $17.50 is 18.3x our  FY12 EPS estimate of $0.96.  This  is 
                                               below  United  Natural  Foods’  multiple  of  19.0x  and  above  Sysco’s  of  12.7x.  Sysco, 
                                               however, is a much slower growing company than both UNFI and Chefs’. We also believe 
                                               Whole Foods and The Fresh Market are tangential comps, and Chefs’ valuation is nicely 
                                               under these companies as well. Our DCF places the value of the company at about $20. 

                                               Risks 

                                               Near-term: economic downturn resulting in meaningful contraction in wealth, 
                                               acquisition-related integration or technology/systems implementation and geographic 
                                               concentration risk. Longer-term: Group purchasing organizations.

                                               Company Snapshot 

                                               The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.  (“Chefs’”)  is  one  of  the  largest  specialty  food

                                               New York is the company’s largest  and most important  market.  Indeed, this

                                               Atlantic City to Boston is the largest for Chefs’, generating approximately 65% of FY10 net 
                                               revenue. In addition, we believe that the company’s operating margins in this region are 
                                               quite  a  bit  higher,  roughly  double  the  operating  margins  in  its  other  regions,  with 
                                               opportunity for even further improvement  over time, we estimate.  The higher margin 
                                               profile doesn’t come as much of a surprise to us given New York is the company’s longest 
                                               standing market, it drives the most revenue, it contains the company’s largest and most 
                                               efficient distribution center and New York metro provides for a very unique concentration 
                                               of customers relative to other U.S. geographies. We believe over time that margins in the 
                                               company’s other regions will improve quite nicely as Chefs’ looks to replicate its model in 
                                               New York, with those markets that have the best densities and lower relative stem miles 
                                               likely able to benefit the most, in our opinion.

                                              Opportunity  in  New  York  market  centred  on  increasing  placements  per 
                                              customer.  According  to  filings,  Chefs’  believes  the  company  distributes  at  least  one 
                                              product per week to roughly 60% of the addressable New York metro market, relative to 
                                              the 20-30% in its other regions currently, with the addressable market constituting those 
                                              independent restaurants with an average price for an entrée of above $15. We do note 
                                              however,  this  is  not  market  share,  but  rather  suggestive  of  the  number  of  unique 
                                              customers to which Chefs’  distributes at least one product,  with restaurants buying a 
                                              myriad of products across food and non-food categories weekly. That said, we believe 
                                              growth in the New York metro market will come more from increased placements per 
                                              customer than new customers  (although plenty of opportunity remains here  as well), 
                                              while growth in Chefs’ other geographies (as well as future markets) should see the scale 
                                              weighed more towards new customers than higher placements in the beginning.

                                                Since its founding in 1985, Chefs’ has grown to become the largest operator 
                                                in the specialty foodservice distribution sub-segment, catering specifically to 
                                                upscale independent menu restaurants, hotels and clubs, among others. With 
                                                over  $330mm  in  net  revenue  in  FY10,  Chefs’  has  grown  its  business  over  time  both 
                                                organically, by increasing the number of new customers it serves as well as the number of 
                                                unique products it distributes to those customers, and through acquisition. As it relates to 
                                                acquisition,  Chefs’   has  added   to  its   organic   growth   with   the   addition   of   tuck-in 
                                                acquisitions in order to both expand the company’s footprint into new geographies, as

                                                increased its penetration of the company’s largest market, New York, with its June 2011

                                               Near-Term Outlook 

                                               Overview 

                                               Overview  of  Pro  Forma  FY11  Adjustments.  We  have  utilized  pro  forma  FY11 
                                               estimates in an effort to better illustrate a normalized operating year for Chefs’ given the 
                                               confluence  of  moving  parts  related  to  its  IPO  in  the  third  quarter  and  the  associated 
                                               deleveraging  process.  The  pro  forma  items  outlined  below  assume  an  IPO  occurs  on 
                                               January 1, 2011. Above the line, revenue and gross profit are unchanged from our non-
                                               pro  forma  estimates.  As  it  relates  to  operating  expenses,  we  have  assumed  higher 
                                               operating expenses associated with being a public company, as well as the removal of the 
                                               stock compensation expense related to the 50% up front vest in 3Q, replaced with a more 
                                               normalized stock compensation expense rate for the whole year. Below the line, the pro 
                                               forma estimates reflect the post IPO capital structure and lower interest expense, as well 
                                               as  the  removal  of  deferred  financing  fee  amortization  and  original  issue  discount 
                                               amortization  under  the  old  capital  structure,  but  include  an  assumption  for  deferred 
                                               financing  fee amortization  going  forward.  The pro  forma  estimates  also  incorporate a 
                                               higher corporate tax rate and pro forma share count to reflect the company’s initial public 
                                               offering. 

                                               3Q11 Pro Forma Expectations – EPS of $0.18, EBITDA of $7.1mm (ex. one-
                                               time items) 
                                                

                                               Total Revenue Growth of 14.3%. We have assumed total organic growth of 7.5%, 
                                               including higher placements/customer and new customers along with contribution from 
                                               mix and higher inflation. Our organic revenue assumptions do incorporate some slowing 
                                               of  organic  growth  given  more  difficult  compares  and  the  potential  for  some  macro 
                                               pressures,  although  continued  trends  similar  to  those  in  1Q  and  2Q  would  present 
                                               opportunity  for  upside.  In  addition,  we  have  assumed  6.8%  growth  from  acquisition 
                                               given the contribution from Harry Wils which closed at the end of 2Q. 

                                               Gross Margin of 26.0% – flat from the prior year period. We have assumed flat 
                                               gross margin improvement as mix and slower inflation pass through could  hold back 
                                               gross margin growth. 

                                               Operating  Expenses  (As  %  of  Net  revenues)  of  19.1%.  Given  the  lack  of  a 
                                               comparable  pro  forma  operating  expense  in  the  prior  year  period,  the  y/y  change  in 
                                               operating expense as a % of sales is not comparable. On a GAAP basis, we assume 205 
                                               bps expense deleverage largely to account for the one-time stock compensation expense 
                                               of approximately $1.6mm associated with the 50% upfront vesting in conjunction with 
                                               the company’s IPO, as well as some carry through of expenses related to Harry Wils. Our 
                                               3Q11 Pro forma operating expense margin of 19.1% reflects the removal of the upfront 
                                               stock  compensation  expense  and  is  replaced  with  a  more  normalized  estimate  for 
                                               quarterly stock compensation. 

                                               Below the Line – Net interest expense of $0.4mm, tax rate of 39.0% and share count of 
                                               20.8mm shares. 

                                               Potential  Hurricane  Impact:  While  it  is  unclear  what  the  impact  could  be  from 
                                               Hurricane Irene on earnings, we do see the potential for $0.01-$0.03 negative drag on EPS in 
                                               3Q11.  That  said,  we  have  left  our  3Q  forecast  unchanged  given  the  treatment  of  any 
                                               potential hurricane-related costs as one-time.

                                              Additional Information – Net interest expense in 3Q adjusts for one-time items related 
                                              to the company’s IPO and refinancing, including the removal of deferred financing fee 
                                              amortization, original issue discount and call premium associated with the pre-IPO capital 
                                              structure. On August 2, 2011, The Chefs’ Warehouse completed its Initial Public Offering, 
                                              offering 4,666,667 primary shares and 5,683,333 secondary shares, including an over-
                                              allotment  of  1,350,000  shares,  at  an  offering  price  of  $15.  The  net  proceeds  to  the 
                                              company of approximately $63.1mm will be used to pay down existing debt. Jefferies & 
                                              Company, Inc. acted as a Joint Bookrunner on the IPO. 

                                               

                                              FY11 Pro Forma Expectations – EPS of $0.77, EBITDA of $29.3mm (ex. one-
                                              time items) 
                                               

                                              Total Revenue Growth of 18.5%. We have assumed total organic growth of 11.2%. 
                                              This is driven by strong growth in placements per customer and new customers, coupled 
                                              with contribution from inflation and mix. We have also assumed acquisition growth of 
                                              4.8% for the year, which incorporates the contribution from Harry Wils in the back-half of 
                                              the year and contribution from the company’s Miami acquisition in 1H:11. The remaining 
                                              difference is attributed to the benefit of the extra selling week in FY11, which we estimate 
                                              improves FY11 revenue growth by 2.4%. 

                                              Gross Margin of 26.2% –  up 22 bps from FY10 Pro Forma. We have assumed 
                                              some gross margin expansion in FY11 as the company laps the 32 bps of contraction last 
                                              year  (non  pro  forma  basis)  on  improved  product  mix  y/y,  offset  by  the  elevated 
                                              inflationary climate and potential for some slower inflation pass through during 2H:11. 

                                              Operating Expenses (As % of Net revenues) of 19.1% – down 119 bps from 
                                              FY10 Pro Forma. On a pro forma basis we have assumed nice operating leverage as the 
                                              company  benefits  from  higher  sales  and  continued  cost  control  as  well  as  improved 
                                              leverage during 4Q given the extra week. 

                                              Below the Line – Net interest expense of $1.7mm, tax rate of 39.1% and share count of 
                                              20.8mm shares. 

                                               

                                              FY12 Expectations – EPS of $0.96, EBITDA of $36.2mm 
                                               

                                              Total Revenue Growth of 11.6%. We have assumed organic growth of 10.5%, plus 
                                              3.3% contribution from Harry Wils in the first half of the year. Our revenue forecast model 
                                              does not assume any additional revenue contribution from acquisitions. FY12 is also a 52 
                                              week year, resulting in an estimated -2.1% impact y/y relative to last year’s 53 week year. 

                                              Gross Margin of 26.3% –  up 10 bps from FY11 Pro Forma. We have assumed 
                                              minimal gross margin expansion in FY12 and beyond mostly due to some benefits from 
                                              mix and improved customer account management. 

                                              Operating Expenses (As % of  Net revenues) of  18.4%  –  down  70  bps from 
                                              FY11 Pro Forma. We have assumed solid operating expense leverage as the company 
                                              benefits from the full rollout of its warehouse management systems by the end of 1Q12, 
                                              as well as continued expense control on higher revenues. FY12 will also include a full year 
                                              of normalized stock compensation and public company expenses.

                                              20.9mm shares.

                                               Turning a Cottage Into an Estate 

                                               Leveraging Technology to Drive Performance 

                                               The application of technology should drive growth and lower costs. Indeed, as 
                                               Chefs’ Warehouse applies best practices and leverages the benefits of its sales, warehouse 
                                               and distribution technology systems, the company should be able to drive better organic 
                                               growth rates and lower costs. This should allow the company to improve its operating 
                                               margins not only in New York, where they are much higher, but also quite nicely in other 
                                               regions as the company looks to replicate its New York model in its other geographies. 
                                               The company’s move to focus heavily on incorporating technology and best practices 
                                               across its business we believe will continue to place further distance between Chefs’ and 
                                               its competitors, who are typically far less sophisticated given the highly fragmented, and 
                                               still very cottage nature of this sub-sector of foodservice distribution. Indeed, our research 
                                               suggests  that  while  other  regional  or  local  competitors  similar  to  Chefs’  may  capture 
                                               higher  gross  margin  in  certain  instances,  Chefs’  is  nevertheless  able  to  deliver  higher 
                                               operating margins given the lower cost to distribute. This is due in part to the company’s 
                                               technology driven efficiencies and practices (the other reason we believe is the lack of 
                                               buyer and supplier power). 

                                               Starting early should be one key to success. Chefs’ has made a concerted effort to 
                                               integrate technology into its business before it speeds up its efforts to consolidate the 
                                               industry,  which  we  believe  should  mitigate  potential  issues  down  the  road  as  Chefs’ 
                                               grows,  while  also  better  positioning  the  company  to  potentially  deliver  and  capture 
                                               improved results over time sooner than perhaps would have been achieved otherwise. 
                                               UNFI, Chefs’ closest public comparable in our opinion, but not a direct competitor, has 
                                               struggled over time with its own technology implementation as the company worked to 
                                               consolidate the industry first and largely implemented technology second. This, coupled 
                                               with the significant growth in the natural and organic industry over the years, has limited 
                                               UNFI’s ability to implement certain technology into its DCs, however this is changing with 
                                               CEO Steve Spinner. While UNFI was able to get the right systems into its new Lancaster, 
                                               TX distribution center late last year, a win on many fronts, UNFI did run into some issues 
                                               with the implementation, which resulted in higher costs and slowed the initial timeline of 
                                               the full rollout to its other DCs. With Chefs’ putting all its technology systems into its 
                                               biggest and busiest facility in NY, we do not believe it will suffer the same fate as UNFI 
                                               (don’t feel too sorry for UNFI, the stock has done just fine!) 

                                               Higher  organic  revenue  and  improved  gross  margin  are  possible  as  the 
                                               company applies technology and best practices to its sales efforts. The benefits 
                                               of applying technology to supercharge Chefs’ selling efforts remain in very early innings, 
                                               we believe, and have the potential to drive higher organic sales as well as improve gross 
                                               margin over the medium and long-term. Indeed, the application of the company’s CRM 
                                               and price optimization technology systems should help Chefs’ increase both the number 
                                               of placements it sells per customer and the number of new customers, while also aiding 
                                               the sales force to better manage account profitability. Chefs’ has also worked to better-
                                               align  its  sales  force  with  its  internal  goals  and  we  believe  the  company’s  constantly 
                                               improving platforms should better provide the sales force the tools it needs. Interestingly, 
                                               similar to the time when the company began to implement early variations of its sales IT 
                                               platforms and systems in 2009, Chefs’  began to see nice improvements in its organic 
                                               growth rates, a welcome sign that the  current application of much improved systems 
                                               could boost results even further.

     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                               The  company  is  also  focused  on  using  technology  and  enhanced  process 
                                               standards  to  help  lower  costs  and  drive  productivity  improvements  in  its 
                                               warehouse and distribution functions. To that end, Chefs’ put in place a warehouse 
                                               management system, Road Net and pick-to-voice technologies into its largest DC in the 
                                               Bronx. While Chefs’ plans to roll-out the warehouse management system to its other DCs 
                                               by  1Q12, it has wisely  already  implemented and tested the systems in its largest and 
                                               busiest distribution center in New York. Next year the company will be moving its current 
                                               Bronx facility to a larger location  in close proximity.  This process could  end up  being 
                                               relatively seamless, although there is the potential for some initial lag in productivity as 
                                               the employees get used to the ins and outs of the new facility. On the distribution side, 
                                               the company is also working on a number of tools to enhance route efficiency. 

                                               Successful  execution  and  leverage  of  its  technology  systems  and  processes 
                                               should  drive  higher  operating  margins,  especially  in  areas  outside  NY  as 
                                               Chefs’ looks to replicate its New York model. Margins in the company’s New York 
                                               market are quite a bit higher than its other regions, roughly double we estimate, largely 
                                               due to efficiency the company has driven into its business in the tri-state area. In addition, 
                                               the  company’s  New  York  market  is  the  longest  standing  for  Chefs’  and  contains  the 
                                               largest and most efficient distribution facility, with the market contributing roughly 65% 
                                               of FY10 consolidated net revenue. Despite the company’s long-standing strength in New 
                                               York, we believe there remains ample runway to improve margins, as higher placements 
                                               per  customer  and  new  customers  are  supported  by  the  efficiencies  gained  from  the 
                                               warehouse management system in its Bronx DC. Clearly, the densities in New York City 
                                               metro and the shorter relative stem miles are also a big help to margins. 

                                               Replicating New York elsewhere should be quite fruitful. Beyond New York, the 
                                               company has significant opportunity to improve the margin profile of its other regions, as 
                                               Chefs’  looks  to  replicate  its  New  York  model including  the  implementation  of  its 
                                               warehouse management system  across its other DCs by 1Q12  and the addition of its 
                                               other CRM and price optimization technologies. Only a select grouping of MSAs in the 
                                               U.S., we believe, have characteristics similar enough to New York, including necessary 
                                               densities, to allow for the potential for similar margin structures to New York over the 
                                               long-term  in  those  markets.  The  company’s  San  Francisco  market  and  south  Florida 
                                               operations would likely fit that profile, as would Chicago, although this is a market in 
                                               which  Chefs’  does  not  currently  operate.  That  said,  margins  in  the  company’s  other 
                                               existing  markets, including  Washington DC, Los Angeles  and  Las Vegas,  also  have the 
                                               potential to move meaningfully higher over time, if the company executes well on its 
                                               strategy, helping the company’s overall margin profile. However, longer stem miles and 
                                               lower densities, are likely to keep the margin structure somewhat below that of New York.

                                                     Fruitful Acquisition Landscape 

                                                     There  is  ample  opportunity  for  accretive,  tuck-in,  acquisitions.  Given  the 
                                                     fragmentation of Chefs’ industry sub-sector, one that is largely dominated by a myriad of 
                                                     less sophisticated, regional or mom and pop operators, there exist significant prospects to 

                                                     expand  Chefs’  distribution  reach  through  acquisition.  Many  of  these  transactions  are 
                                                     largely purchases of customer lists, lowering integration risk, while providing increased 

                                                     share in its current markets as well as expansion in new geographies. We expect that most 
                                                     of these purchases will be relatively small, $10-$30 million in revenues, and be nicely 
                                                     accretive as they should be done at 2-4x EBITDA. 

                                                     The  number  of  acquisitions  done  per  year  is  likely  to  increase,  although 

                                                     future  acquisition  activity  is  not  in  our  numbers.  Indeed,  the  company  has 
                                                     acquired a number of smaller operators over the last few years, averaging approximately 

                                                     one transaction per year. We believe that the company is likely to step-up the number of 
                                                     acquisitions  it does on a yearly basis to  perhaps  2-3 transactions per year on average 
                                                     which we estimate could add a few hundred basis points of sales growth annually. In 

                                                     FY10, sales growth from acquisitions totalled approximately 3%, while we estimate that a 
                                                     half   year   contribution   from   the   company’s   June   2010   Miami   acquisition  and  the 
                                                     company’s  June  2011  acquisition  of  Harry  Wils  in  New  York  metro  should  add  a 

                                                     combined 4.8% to sales growth in FY11. In FY12 we have assumed 3.3% sales growth 
                                                     from acquisitions, representing the contribution in the first half of the year from Harry 

                                                     Wils.  We  estimate  total  revenue  contribution  for  Harry  Wils  of  approximately  $25mm 
                                                     annualized, after-taking a discount to our estimated sales of approximately $30mm, in-
                                                     line   with   the   company’s   acquisition   practices,   although   this   could  indeed  prove 

                                                     conservative    if    customer    retention    remains    high.  Outside    of    recently    acquired 
                                                     transactions, we do not model in any benefit from future transactions.

                                                     company’s   typical   transaction   involves  the   purchase   of   smaller,  regional   or   local

                                                     operators with an average cash outlay for Chefs’ over its last four transactions of just over 
                                                     $5mm, which also tend to be accretive. In addition, many of the acquisitions involve the 
                                                     purchase of customer lists, working capital and inventory, which significantly lowers the 

                                                     integration  risk  and  shortens  the  time  to  close.  Lastly,  the  company  remains  quite 
                                                     conservative in its forecasts for contribution from  acquisitions, and assumes a  sizeable 
                                                     discount to actual revenues, which we estimate is upwards of 20-30%, depending on the 

                                                     transaction. This is to account for the potential for any customer transition or leakage, 
                                                     although we believe this assumption ends up being conservative in the end. The purchase 

                                                     price in a typical transaction is  done between 2-4x EBITDA with cash on hand and/or 
                                                     debt, resulting in nice accretion.

                                                 Establishing  an  initial  presence  in  a  new  geography  will  likely  come  from 
                                                 acquisition. While three of the company’s four most recent transactions helped to add 
                                                 customers to already existing markets, such as New York, San Francisco and Washington, 
                                                 DC, we expect Chefs’ to move into additional new geographies across the U.S. over time, 
                                                 with the focus on the major MSAs with the best densities and culinary characteristics. An 
                                                 example of a transaction which allowed Chefs’ to establish a new presence in a market 
                                                 was the company’s June 2010 acquisition of Culinaire Specialty Foods, Inc., giving Chefs’ 
                                                 the opportunity  to  go into  South  Florida  for  a  mere $3.7mm.  After  entering  the new 
                                                 market,  the  company  can  expand  distribution  through  new  customers  and  increased 
                                                 placements per existing customer, although on-boarding new customers will represent 
                                                 the bulk of growth for some time in new markets, we believe. In Miami, Chefs’ will also 
                                                 be moving its current operations to a new facility in 3Q of FY11.  

                                                 A Look at Population Densities in the U.S. 

                                                 Density  analysis  suggests   opportunity  for  margin  improvement  in  other 
                                                 markets. While it is clear that the densities in the New York MSA, being the highest in the 
                                                 country, help Chefs’ capture higher profitability in the region, there are also a number of 
                                                 markets which likely have sufficient density profiles to support higher margin structures. 
                                                 Miami,  Philadelphia,  Boston  and  San  Francisco  are  all  markets  in  which  Chefs’  has  a 
                                                 presence,  although  some  more  than  others  at  the  current  juncture.  Chicago,  which 
                                                 registers third on the list below, is a market in which Chefs’ does not currently operate, 
                                                 but has attractive density profiles as well.

                                                Chefs’ Model Positions It to Capture Excess Profits 

                                                Limited  industry  buyer  and  supplier  power,  coupled  with  Chefs’  superior 
                                                product   offering   and   uniquely   positioned   sales   force   should   allow   the 
                                                company   to   capture   excess   profits.  Unlike   certain   other   segments   of   food 
                                                distribution, Chefs’ faces limited buyer or supplier power risk, as its top ten customers 
                                                account for under 10% of net revenue and no supplier accounts for more than 5% of its 
                                                products. In addition, Chefs’ also carries over 11,500 SKUs, an amount roughly 7x its 
                                                typical competitor and provides a much broader range of specialty products, while also 
                                                offering  many  everyday  staple  items  (flour,  sugar,  butter)  as  well.  Finally,  Chefs’  125 
                                                person sales force is uniquely positioned, as most are culinary educated or  have spent 
                                                significant time in the culinary industry. 

                                                Limited buyer and supplier power position Chefs’ quite favorably as it looks 
                                                to   consolidate  the   fragmented   landscape   over   the   long-term.  The   highly 
                                                fragmented landscape of distributors, which is largely composed of a myriad of regional 
                                                and  local  specialty  operators  who  service  an  also  fragmented  independent  restaurant 
                                                industry in the U.S., provides a favorable backdrop for Chefs’, indeed. This is especially 
                                                true as the top 10 customers for Chefs’ account for under 10% of net revenue. Equally 
                                                important, is that Chefs’ is supplied by an also fragmented network of producers, over 
                                                1,000  according  to  the  company,  with  many  instances  in  which  Chefs’  is  the  largest 
                                                distributor of a manufacturer’s product(s). According to filings, no supplier accounts for 
                                                more than 5% of Chefs’ products distributed. Taken together, this advantage should pay 
                                                dividends  for  Chefs’  over  the  long-run,  as  limited  buyer  and  supplier  power  suggest 
                                                excess profitability in the industry should go to the consolidator, with the potential for 
                                                further flow through to the bottom line given Chefs’ technology driven efficiencies. We 
                                                believe this  is  one of  the reasons  Chefs’  garners  higher  profit  margins  than its  public 
                                                comparables, UNFI and Sysco (SYY, $27.16, NC). While UNFI has been a consolidator in 
                                                the natural and organic space, they, unlike Chefs’, do face some supplier power and even 
                                                larger buyer power, with Hain Celestial (HAIN, $30.37, Buy) representing roughly 7% of 
                                                total   purchases   and   Whole   Foods  representing  35%   of   UNFI’s   net   sales   in   FY10, 
                                                something which has a tendency to depress excess profitability. 

                                                Superior product offering will continue to be a key differentiator for Chefs’. 
                                                The company’s vast product offering, including a wide variety of specialty items from 
                                                across the globe, places Chefs’ in a category all its own, in our opinion, relative to its 
                                                typical  competition.  Indeed,  the  company  distributes  over  11,500  SKUs,  an  amount 
                                                which represents approximately 7x the average SKU count of other competing specialty 
                                                distributors. Over the long-term, Chefs’ growing offering should allow the company to 
                                                further meet the diverse and ever-changing needs and tastes of  its chef customers. In 
                                                addition, we believe the company’s ability to provide a wide variety of food categories, as 
                                                well as certain everyday staple items, in a cost efficient manner limits the opportunity for 
                                                other distributors to take share and in fact further strengthens Chefs’ positioning in the 
                                                industry. While a typical independent restaurant is likely to have a number of different 
                                                suppliers  based  on  its  needs,  as  Chefs’  continues  to  expand  its  product  offering,  the 
                                                potential   opportunity   exists   for   the   company   to   perhaps   displace  competitors  as

                                               A differentiated sales force and Chefs’ ability to extend credit to its customers 
                                               provide a strong go-to-market advantage. Chefs’ sales force looks to be uniquely 
                                               positioned as most are culinary educated or have spent significant time in the culinary 
                                               industry.  We believe this is uniquely advantageous and allows the company to better 
                                               understand and meet the needs of its chef customers as they look to differentiate their 
                                               product offering. In addition, given the spot nature of the order volume based on the 
                                               customers’ needs, Chefs’ ability to extend credit to its customers and manage that well is 
                                               a necessity for its customers. It is also a limiting factor in the growth of group purchasing 
                                               organizations  into  the  independent  restaurant  industry,  the  biggest  long-term  risk  for 
                                               Chefs’  we believe, as  these organizations  typically do not extend credit  to customers. 
                                               Chefs’  write-off  ratio  over  the  last  few  years  has  averaged  roughly  32  bps,  as  the 
                                               company’s dedicated Credit and Collections Department manages it well depending on 
                                               the climate. 

                                               Much more complicated than meets the eye. Despite what  may appear to be a 
                                               relatively  simple  and  straightforward  distribution  model,  Chefs’  specialty  business  is 
                                               intensely more complicated than may outwardly appear, something we determined first 
                                               hand one night as we witnessed how a product goes from the shelf in the warehouse to 
                                               the truck and ultimately to the customer. Profit margins generally in the food distribution 
                                               business are thin as companies rely on solid sales leverage and cost efficiencies to turn a 
                                               good profit. While larger broadline foodservice operators and those bigger distributors in 
                                               the food-at-home channel have the ability to drive efficiencies through larger drop sizes 
                                               and item volumes, we were  struck by  the inherent complexity in  not only  building a 
                                               pallet through the piece-pick process, but ultimately breaking down a pallet on the truck 
                                               as it is distributed  to the different customers on the route. We believe  the company’s 
                                               ability to operate a complex specialty distribution business and generate industry leading 
                                               profitability provides a distinct competitive advantage for Chefs’ and a barrier to entry for 
                                               others.  Indeed, the company’s order to fill rate is over  99%, pretty astounding,  while 
                                               miss-picks are now well under 1%. 

                                               Chefs’ is led by a very strong management team with significant experience. 
                                               The  company  was  founded  and  built  from  the  ground  up  by  Christopher  Pappas, 
                                               Chairman and CEO, and John Pappas, Director and Vice Chairman. Over the last six years, 
                                               the company has made a significant push to invest in its business, including both people 
                                               and technology. This included the hiring of James Wagner in 2005, appointed to COO in 
                                               March 2011, the hiring of Kenneth Clark in 2007, appointed to CFO in March 2009 and 
                                               the hiring of Frank O’Dowd in 2007, the company’s CIO.  These additions have created, 
                                               in  our  opinion,  a  formidable  senior  team.  Indeed,  the  chemistry  that  has  developed 
                                               between Mr. Pappas the CEO and Mr. Wagner the COO, while somewhat intangible, is 
                                               also quite important as this company sets a path toward accelerating growth.

                                               A Way to Invest in the High-End Consumer 

                                               Chefs’,  we  believe,  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  invest  in  the  faster-
                                               growth,  high-end  consumer  segment  in  the  food-away-from-home  channel 
                                               that is driven by the wealthy and educated consumer. Indeed, as exhibited nicely 
                                               by Whole Foods, United Natural Foods, and The Fresh Market, among others, the high-
                                               end  consumer  segment  has  exhibited  very  strong  growth  coming  out  of  the  2008 
                                               downturn and continues to show resilience. With a correlation of 0.80 between Chefs’ 
                                               organic  growth  and  household  wealth,  similar  to  the  correlation  exhibited  by  Whole 
                                               Foods  according  to  our  calculations,  Chefs’  customers  clearly  cater  to  the  higher-end 
                                               demographic and, as a result, recent stock market gyrations are a concern. However, our 
                                               research  has  shown  little  slowdown  in  trends,  although  we  have  built  much  lower 
                                               organic growth into our model in the back half of 2011. If this does not materialize, EPS 
                                               could exceed our current estimate with every 1% in sales equal to just under ½ penny in 
                                               earnings per quarter, according to our estimates.

                                               broader economy. Indeed, the unemployment rate of individuals with bachelor’s degrees 
                                               and  higher  is  4.3%,  down  from  5.1%  in  November  2010.  The actions  by  the Federal

                                               the unique experience provided by the independent menu restaurants. In addition, the

                                               picture,  leading  to  wealth  contraction  in  the  higher-end  demographic,  would  likely 
                                               impact Chefs’ to some degree, the company has made significant improvements on its 
                                               operations and practices across its sales, warehouse and distribution functions since the 
                                               last downturn a few years ago. Chefs’ has and continues to build upon best practices and 
                                               implemented large scale improvements to its technology infrastructure (the benefits of 
                                               which  remain  in  very  early  innings  we  believe)  in  an  effort  to  truly  supercharge  its 
                                               business. These actions have not only served to strengthen the company’s operations, but 
                                               have also provided the company increased up to the moment insight (and still improving) 
                                               into  the business  and  prepared  Chefs’  to  drive results  and  gain  share even  when  the 
                                               backdrop remains less favorable.

                                              A Fragmented Food Distribution 

                                              Landscape 

                                              The U.S. food distribution landscape is vast and characterized by a wide range 
                                              of  operator-types  who  distribute  across  the  food-away-from-home  (chain 
                                              restaurants, hospitals, hotels, etc.) and food-at-home (supermarkets, grocery 
                                              retail,  etc.)  channels.  The  broader  food-away-from-home  channel  in  which  Chefs’ 
                                              operates  is  dominated  by  major,  national  broadline  distributors  such  as  Sysco,  U.S. 
                                              Foodservice and Performance Food Group, as well as a number of regional and smaller 
                                              operators. Operators such as Sysco and its two closest peers, distribute largely to chain 
                                              restaurants, participants in the hospitality industry (hotels, etc.) and other large healthcare 
                                              and educational institutions, among others. Chefs’ operates in a much smaller niche of 
                                              the  food-away-from-home distribution channel, focusing  specifically  on specialty items 
                                              sold largely to upscale independent menu restaurants, as well as hotels, other fine dining 
                                              establishments, country clubs and culinary schools, among others, all driven by a focus 
                                              on the chef and the cuisine served.

      Initiating Coverage

      September 6, 2011

                                                  UNFI, the largest natural and organic product wholesale distributor in the 
                                                  U.S. and Canada, which also distributes a broad range of specialty food/non-
                                                  food items, is the best public comp to CHEF, in our opinion. Much like the path 
                                                  of   UNFI   over   its   history,  consolidating  a   highly   fragmented   natural   and   organic 
                                                  distribution landscape, The Chefs’ Warehouse appears to be on a similar trajectory with 
                                                  the opportunity to consolidate its also-fragmented sub-sector of the industry, albeit one 
                                                  that caters to a different end-customer (namely the chef of the upscale independent menu 
                                                  restaurant). To that end, we find Chefs’ at its current stage of lifecycle very analogous to 
                                                  where UNFI was in the 1990s and early 2000’s, albeit with the advantage of having put 
                                                  technology into its busiest facility fairly early into its rapid growth cycle. UNFI, on the 
                                                  other hand, has struggled to get productivity enhancing tools deployed which we believe 
                                                  has hurt margins (although not the stock price all that much!). 

                                                  Buyer and supplier power are much more a factor for UNFI than they are for 
                                                  CHEF. Unlike CHEF, UNFI operates in the food-at-home channel, distributing largely to 
                                                  independent natural product retailers, supernatural chains (i.e. Whole Foods), as well as 
                                                  other conventional and mass retailers. Indeed, UNFI has a long-track record and a very 
                                                  dominant position in the  natural and organic industry, however significant buyer and 
                                                  supplier concentration do exist, namely in Whole Foods and Hain Celestial. UNFI is the 
                                                  largest distributor to Whole Foods, representing 35% of UNFI’s total net sales in FY10. In 
                                                  addition, roughly 7% of total purchases for UNFI come from Hain Celestial, the leading 
                                                  manufacturer of natural and organic food and related products.

     CHEF
                                                
     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                               UNFI  has  a  somewhat  similar  revenue  growth  profile  to  CHEF,  as  strong 
                                               organic growth rates are further supplemented by acquisitions, but CHEF’s 
                                               long-term EPS growth appears more favorable. Indeed, UNFI has grown net sales 
                                               at  a  roughly 15%  CAGR  since  fiscal  year  2000  and  we  estimate approximately 10.3% 
                                               revenue growth for UNFI next year (FY12: July). As it relates to Chefs’ Warehouse, we 
                                               estimate   organic  revenue  growth   of   10.5%  in   FY12  (Dec)  and   a  growth   rate   of 
                                               approximately 10% on average over the next five years (FY11-FY15). Indeed, aside from 
                                               already  announced  acquisitions  (Culinaire  Specialty  Foods  and  Harry  Wils)  we  do  not 
                                               incorporate acquisition-related growth into our model, which we believe could add a few 
                                               hundred basis points per year to sales. While both UNFI and CHEF have similar revenue 
                                               growth profiles, CHEF’s 3-year EPS CAGR of approximately 18% (based off our pro forma 
                                               FY11 EPS of $0.77 for comparison purposes) is higher than what we estimate for UNFI at 
                                               12%, over a similar time frame. While UNFI is farther along the maturation growth curve 
                                               than Chefs’ and is directly benefitting from a natural and organic secular tailwind (which 
                                               Chefs’ is not), we believe an EPS CAGR of 12-15% for UNFI is reasonable. 

                                               Chefs’  Warehouse  also  garners  a more favorable margin structure  than its 
                                               peers.  While  UNFI’s  business  in  recent  periods  has  grown  more  quickly  with  lower-
                                               margin conventional and mass customers, pressuring its gross margin before the lowered 
                                               cost to service those specific customers is able to offset, we believe the roughly 300-400 
                                               bps higher operating margin (and growing) at CHEF is attributable to three main factors. 
                                               First, we believe that Chefs’ ability to drive higher margins through the utilization and 
                                               leverage of its technology and infrastructure, such as its warehouse management system, 
                                               among others has allowed the company to reduce operating costs and benefit from sales 
                                               leverage, which should continue to improve over time. Second, the limited buyer and 
                                               supplier power faced by Chefs’ have allowed the company to capture better profits given 
                                               the fragmentation of its industry backdrop. Indeed, our research suggests that while other 
                                               regional or local competitors similar to Chefs’ may capture higher gross margins in certain 
                                               instances, Chefs’ is nevertheless able to deliver higher operating margins given the lower 
                                               cost to distribute and the benefits of its IT platform, a factor we believe should lead to 
                                               further improvement in operating margins over time. Finally, the very specialty nature of 
                                               Chefs’ products leads to higher gross margin in certain instances. 

                                               Moving on to Sysco, which we also see as a logical compare to CHEF, there are 
                                               perhaps   greater   relative   differences   to   CHEF   than   exhibited   by   UNFI, 
                                               suggesting the comparison,  while appropriate,  is not as strong.  Sysco is the 
                                               largest foodservice distributor  in North America, according to the company, with over 
                                               $39bn in sales in FY11 (July 2, 2011). Similar to Chefs’, SYY also operates in the broader 
                                               food-away-from-home  channel, while UNFI operates in the food-at-home channel.  SYY 
                                               largely services chain restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, hotels and motels, as well 
                                               as   schools   and   colleges,   among   others.  Of   the   three   large   broadline   foodservice 
                                               distributors, also including U.S. Foodservice and Performance Food Group, SYY is the only 
                                               public operator.

                                                    Despite  its  size,  SYY  has  a  much  lower  organic  growth  rate  and  a  lower

                                                    to CHEF, we believe. Indeed, since FY01 SYY has grown sales at a roughly 6% CAGR, 

                                                    less than half the 10-year CAGR rate of UNFI. In its recently ended FY11, SYY grew top-line 

                                                    at a similar 6% rate. Long-term organic sales growth for SYY is likely in the mid-single digit 

                                                    range as the company captures market share on-top of more moderate industry growth.

                                                    perspective, SYY commands higher operating margins than UNFI, averaging roughly 5% 

                                                    for SYY, but 3% for UNFI over the last few years. SYY’s operating margin, however still

     Initiating Coverage

                                              Discounted Cash Flow 

                                              Our conservative DCF value of approximately $20 suggests equity upside as 
                                              Chefs’  grows  and  drives  improved  operating  leverage.  We  assume  organic 
                                              growth of 11.2% and 10.5% in FY11 and FY12. Including the contribution from Chefs’ 
                                              Miami acquisition last year and its June 2011 acquisition of Harry Wils, we estimate 4.8% 
                                              and 3.3% of contribution in FY11 and FY12, respectively. FY11 is also a 53 week period, 
                                              which  we  estimate  adds  2.4%  to  sales  this  year,  while  reducing  sales  in  FY12  on  a 
                                              comparable y/y basis by 2.1%. All in, we estimate total sales growth of 18.5% and 11.6% 
                                              in  FY11  and  FY12,  respectively.  For  FY11  through  FY15  we  estimate  organic  sales  of 
                                              approximately 10% over the time period. We estimate total sales on average over the 
                                              FY12-FY20 period of 8.8%, with 4% sales growth in the terminal value. If we were to add 
                                              1% in revenue growth throughout the life of our model (starting in FY12 and excluding 
                                              the TV year) this would add approximately $1.50 to our DCF value. 

                                              We estimate improving EBIT margins over time. We estimate EBIT margin of 7.1% 
                                              in FY11 on a pro forma basis and 7.9% in FY12, driven largely by improved revenue and 
                                              operating expense leverage, with slight gross margin improvement. Our model assumes a 
                                              9%  EBIT  margin  is  achieved  by  FY17  and  remains  flat  at  9%  thereafter,  through  the 
                                              terminal value. According to our estimates, 100bps of margin difference spread equally 
                                              over FY12-FY17 adds or subtracts approximately $2.50 from our DCF value. 

                                              Depreciation and Amortization are estimated to grow in line with sales. We 
                                              have assumed $1.5mm and $8.3mm in CapEx in FY11 and FY12. The step-up next year is 
                                              due largely to the company’s move from its current Bronx NY facility to another in close 
                                              proximity. Over the long-term we slowly move CapEx (as a % of net revenue) higher as 
                                              the company  expands  its  business  over  time.  In  addition,  we  assume  working  capital 
                                              usage each year and assume a 39% tax rate. We also assume a weighted average cost of 
                                              capital for our DCF analysis of 9.7% with every ½ of one percent decrease boosting the 
                                              value of the DCF by approximately $2.30.

                                                Risks 

                                                Group purchasing organizations could potentially depress margins over the 
                                                long-term. The influx of group purchasing organizations over time into the independent 
                                                restaurant  channel  could  serve  to  depress  profitability  for  Chefs’  Warehouse.  Group 
                                                purchasing  organizations  largely  seek  to  aggregate  individual  parties  in  an  effort  to 
                                                improve the collective buying power of the group to a greater degree than could be done 
                                                on an individual basis. While these organizations  currently are  not as  prevalent in the 
                                                industry sub-sector in which Chefs’ participates as in other areas, if Chefs’ customers were 
                                                to join or form larger scale group purchasing organizations in an effort to reduce their 
                                                costs  of  buying  products  from Chefs’ and other  similar distributors, this could reduce 
                                                profitability for Chefs’ Warehouse. While we believe this represents the biggest potential 
                                                risk  for  the  company  over  the  long-term,  there  are  mitigating  factors,  including  the 
                                                extension  of  credit  to  customers.  Given  the  nature  of  the  industry,  Chefs’  regularly 
                                                extends credit to its customers, while group purchasing organizations largely do not.  We 
                                                also believe Chefs’ model and the unique relationships it has with its customers and the 
                                                chefs could help deter the formation of such groups in the company’s industry segment.  
                                                Finally, through its CRM and price optimization technologies Chefs makes sure it is not 
                                                fleecing its customers, particularly its high volume clients. 

                                                Strong  correlation  to   wealth   and   the   high-end   consumer  present   both 
                                                opportunity and risk for Chefs’ Warehouse. While Chefs’ business does fall into the 
                                                category   of   foodservice   distribution,   its   customers   largely   cater   to   the   higher-end 
                                                demographic and as a result Chefs’ business is strongly influenced by this segment of the 
                                                population.  Indeed,  with  a  correlation  of  0.80  between  Chefs’  organic  growth  and 
                                                household wealth, as defined by the Federal Reserve, there remains opportunity on the 
                                                upside  given   the strong  growth  exhibited  by  this  segment  despite  high  stagnant 
                                                unemployment  and  rising  prices  for  food  and  fuel  in  recent  periods.  However,  if  the 
                                                macro  economy  were   to   deteriorate,   leading   to   a   contraction   in   wealth   for   this 
                                                demographic in the U.S., Chefs’ sales and earnings would likely be negatively impacted. 
                                                Whole Foods, which by our calculation exhibits a similar correlation between its comp 
                                                sales and wealth, saw a noticeable decline in its sales during the 2008-2009 down turn. 
                                                To that end, we believe that Chefs’ organic sales could exhibit greater movement on the 
                                                upside and downside given the nature of the food-away-from-home segment, relative to 
                                                those similar companies that participate in the food-at-home channel such as UNFI and 
                                                Whole Foods for example.  However,  Chefs’  has made significant improvements on its 
                                                business since the last downturn which have provided greater strength, flexibility and 
                                                insight into its operations, better positioning the company for the long-term, as well as 
                                                helping to offset shorter-term macro weakness. Indeed, thus far our research has revealed 
                                                little if any slowing in the high-end food channel.

     Initiating Coverage

     September 6, 2011

                                                Chefs’  operations  are  concentrated  in  New  York.  The  company’s  New  York 
                                                market,  which  falls  between  Atlantic  City  and  Boston,  but  is  largely  concentrated  in 
                                                greater   New   York   City,  is   the   largest   and   most   important   for   Chefs’.  Indeed, 
                                                approximately 65% of FY10 net revenues came from this geography, and we estimate a 
                                                significant portion of total company profitability. As such, any material adverse event as it 
                                                relates to Chefs’ business in this region could have a significant negative impact on the 
                                                company’s operations and results. In FY12, the company will be moving its DC to another 
                                                facility  in  very  close  proximity.  While  we  do  not  anticipate  any  significant  issues,  any 
                                                operational slowdown related to this move could impact results. 

                                                Acquisition growth adds execution risk. As Chefs’ Warehouse expands its presence 
                                                into  new  geographies,  the  company  will  look  to  add  customers  through  acquisition. 
                                                Indeed, over time the company has added to organic growth with acquisitions and we 
                                                expect this to continue. Over the last few years, the company has completed about one 
                                                acquisition per year, however, we expect this rate to increase to perhaps 2-3 transactions 
                                                per year on average as Chefs’ looks to grow outside its current geographies as well as 
                                                within current ones.  While any acquisition presents the possibility of execution-related 
                                                risk, there do tend to be some factors which help to mitigate risk for Chefs’. Transaction 
                                                sizes have historically been small, with three of Chefs’ last four at or below $5mm and the 
                                                latest transaction under $10mm, although any future transactions could in fact be larger. 
                                                In addition, many transactions involve the purchase of customer lists and related items, 
                                                along with inventory and working capital, suggesting more limited integration risk. 

                                                Technology and systems implementation risk. The company is moving to bring its 
                                                systems outside of New York. While we believe this process will be smooth, it does create 
                                                some temporary execution risk as the systems are deployed. 

                                                Excessive  inflation  or  deflation  could  present  challenges  for  the  company. 
                                                Indeed, higher costs for food inputs could raise the cost to produce for suppliers and in 
                                                turn reduce the company’s gross margin or make it more difficult to pass along to its 
                                                customers. One factor that helps to mitigate some risk in a period of rising food inputs is 
                                                that Chefs’ distributes a wide variety of products which on  a relative basis are not as 
                                                heavily  tied  to  one  specific  commodity  input.  However,  the  company  does  remain 
                                                exposed  to  rising  fuel  prices.  While  there  is  some  pass  through  pricing  ability,  the 
                                                company  does  not  employ  sophisticated  hedging  strategies  and  significant  or  sharp 
                                                increases in fuel prices could have a negative impact on results. In addition, prolonged 
                                                periods of deflation or falling prices would also likely present challenges for Chefs’ as the 
                                                company uses higher sales to help leverage fixed costs.

Meanings of Jefferies Ratings
Buy - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.
Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.
The expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) for Buy rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10 is 20% or more within
a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.
CS - Coverage Suspended. Jefferies has suspended coverage of this company.
NC - Not covered. Jefferies does not cover this company.
Restricted - Describes issuers where, in conjunction with Jefferies engagement in certain transactions, company policy or applicable securities
regulations prohibit certain types of communications, including investment recommendations.
Monitor - Describes stocks whose company fundamentals and financials are being monitored, and for which no financial projections or opinions on
the investment merits of the company are provided.
