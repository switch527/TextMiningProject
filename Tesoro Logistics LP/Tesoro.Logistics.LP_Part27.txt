Investment Thesis 

TLLP is a fee-based, growth  oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to own, operate and 
acquire crude oil and refined products logistic s assets. In other words, TLLP was formed 
to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its logistics infrastructure business. Initially, 
substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under various 
long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume commitments. 
Near term, there is visible growth from already identified projects and future drop-downs or 
asset sales from Tesoro Corp. Longer term, we expect that TLLPs third party business will 
grow both organically and via acquisitions.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.7 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 51% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights. 

Additional Color 

■   Ethanol project completed:  In 2Q11 TLLP completed the Salt Lake City Terminal 
    Ethanol project which is projected to provide $1mm of annual EBITDA. 

■   High Plains Pipeline System expansion:  TLLP will be spending $5mm to build a 
    gathering hub and initial gathering pipeline at Connelly, North Dakota that would 
    receive crude oil by pipeline which is currently  received by truck. Tesoro will reimburse 
    the initial project cost and there will be no expected near term  earnings impact to 
    TLLP. However, it does position the partnership for future growth. 

■   Existing Projects Update:  The partnership expects to spend around $18mm or 
    $17mm net of reimbursement from Tesoro on the projects announced earlier that are 
    projected to be completed in 2012. These projects are expected to provide $8mm 
    additional EBITDA annually. 

■   Segment Growth Projects:  

    o    Crude Oil Gathering  TLLP expects to spend around $13mm on expansion 
        projects which will provide around $6 mm of additional EBITDA annually. These 
        projects are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. 

    o    Terminalling, Transportation and Stor age  TLLP expects to spend around 
        $12mm on expansion projects which wi      ll provide around $4mm of additional

■   Potential Dropdowns from Tesoro Provide Visible Growth Opportunities.  Tesoro 
     still has logistics assets with total aggr  egate book value of $240 million that may be 
     sold to TLLP. This compares to approximately $193 million for the initial assets 
     contributed to TLLP. Furthermore, Tesoro announced a project to deliver 30,000 bpd 
     of Bakken crude oil to its Anacortes refinery via rail on 7/15/2011. Tesoro will build an 
     unloading facility to accommodate the unit trai                 n. Once completed, Tesoro plans to 
     offer the facility to TLLP.

■   Raising Estimates.    We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $28.8mm (from 
     $26.2mm) and $70.5mm (from $58.8mm) in 2H11 and FY2012, respectively. DCF is 
     forecast at $25.8mm (from $23.2mm) and $61mm (from $50.4mm) in 2H11 and 
     FY2012, respectively. The revisions reflect a higher run-rate exiting 2Q11 and positive 
     impact from growth capital expenditures. 

■   DCF coverage ratio expected to be high.     We expect   TLLPs coverage ratio to 
     remain high at around 1.3x in FY2012. A hi gher coverage ratio gives TLLP the ability 
     to fund its dropdowns to a certain extent without accessing the capital markets and 
     gives it flexibility to grow its distributions in the future. 

■   Liquidity: At the end of 2Q TLLP had approximately $110mm of liquidity, consisting of 
     $10mm of cash and $100mm available under its credit facility.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O):  The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relev ant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29  th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian  ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative  attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals t  he less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investm  ent opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute to  tal return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions   and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ra tings are based on a stocks total return relative to the a verage total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the an  alyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculat  ion and a 15% and a 
7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and   7.5% thresholds 
replace the +10-15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. 
**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Cr edit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulatio  ns preclude certain types of communications,  
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward. 
 
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
*An analysts coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector.

*For purposes of the NYSE and NASD ratings distribution disclosure requirements, our stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and   Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, 
Hold, and Sell, respectively; however, the meanings are not the same, as our stock ratings are determined on a relative basis.   (Please refer to definitions above.) An investor's 
decision to buy or sell a security should be based on investment objectives, current holdings, and other individual factors.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $29 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, 
distribution compounded annual growth rate of  8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a termin  al growth rate of 
1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $29 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon  TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at   the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destructio n and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

This report is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction

The information, tools and material presented in this report are provided to you for information purposes only and are not to be used or considered as an offer or the solicitation of an 
offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report 
constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appr opriate to your individual circumstances or otherwise 
constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or complet  eness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this repo  rt. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, ex        press or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophis ticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.
