Quarter  Highlights. Active  Network  reported  a  solid  Q2  with  both  revenue  and  EBITDA  above  our  estimates  and

consensus. Revenues of $99M (up 21% Y/Y) exceeded our estimate of $95M and consensus of $95.2M. Revenue upside

was mainly driven by higher marketing services and software fees. Registration revenues of $69.7M (15% Y/Y) were slightly

below our $70.6M estimate. Registrations increased 7% Y/Y (vs. our 8% estimate) while revenue per registration increased

8%  (in  line  with  our  estimate).  Software  revenues  of  $15.8M  (49%  Y/Y)  exceeded  our  $13.3M  estimate  as  a  few  deals

closed  sooner  than  we  expected.  Marketing  Services  revenues  of  $13.5M  (28%  Y/Y)  exceeded  our  $11.1M  estimate  as

Active  benefited  from  higher  advertising  on  its  core  destination  Websites.  Top-line  upside  and  mix  shift  to  higher  margin

marketing services helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $20.4M, 16% above our and the Street estimates.

                                                                                                 Company Report
                                                                                                  Reported Results

VALUATION:
Our $23 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based on 25x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $54M. We believe a 25x
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Acquisitions. Active  has  been  highly  acquisitive,  with  over  25  acquisitions  over  the  past  five  years.  Going  forward,  we
believe the company will likely continue to be acquisitive to gain share and expand into new categories and geographies.
While we believe the company's track record in integrating acquisitions has been good thus far, acquisitions always create
uncertainties and could be a distraction for management.

Competition. While we believe the market for Web-based reservations and activity-based software is highly fragmented, we
believe the large and growing market opportunity is likely to attract additional entrants. Today, Active primarily competes
with legacy registration methods such as pen and paper, mail, and phone based reservations. Additionally, Active competes
with internally developed software applications, off-the-shelf software (i.e., Microsoft Excel), as well as companies that offer
Web-based solutions in one or more of its vertical areas.

Slower Adoption of Web-Based Reservation Systems. While online penetration for events and activities registration is
still low today, which we believe presents significant growth potential for the company, slower-than-expected online adoption
from organizations and participants may limit Active Network's near-term growth potential.

Macroeconomic  Environment. We  believe  the  activities  and  events  market  is  sensitive  to  consumer  sentiment  and  the
overall economic environment. For instance, the company experienced a significant slowdown in its business in the second
half  of  2008  due  to  the  economic  downturn.  In  addition,  due  to  the  company's  exposure  to  the  parks  and  recreation
segment, governmental budgetary cuts could adversely impact the company's growth rates.

Transition to ActiveWorks Platform. While we believe the company's transition from its legacy platform to PaaS-based
ActiveWorks  should  drive  increased  efficiencies  and  margin  expansion,  the  transition  is  time  consuming  and  requires
significant investment. We note that in 2010, approximately 35% of Active's research and development spending was on the
legacy  platform.  We  currently  expect  Active  to  transition  off  the  legacy  platform  by  2014.  Delays  in  the  transition  (i.e.,
difficulties in convincing customers to migrate) would likely adversely impact Active's operating leverage.
