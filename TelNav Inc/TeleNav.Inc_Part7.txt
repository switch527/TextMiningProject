 TeleNav reported fiscal 3Q11 results and hosted a conference call after the close on April 28. Financial results and subscriber metrics
 were better than expected. Management raised fiscal 2011 guidance and issued fiscal 4Q11 guidance above our estimates.

 Financial Results
 Third  quarter  revenues  were  16.1%  ahead  of  our  forecast,  while  adjusted  EBITDA  was  47%  ahead;  note  that  reported  financial
 measures included a $6.6M benefit from the renegotiation of TeleNav's terms with Ford. GAAP EPS of $0.25 was 9c ahead of our
 estimate and 7c ahead of street consensus of $0.18.

 TeleNav's Mobile Navigation Business Continues To Grow
 TeleNav grew its subscriber base to an average of 22.5M users, ahead of our estimates. This was helped by the recent launch of
 bundled service for Boost Mobile subscribers and the launch of nationwide service via the China Mobile brand. TeleNav may look to
 acquisitions (using its available cash) to speed entry into new geographies in the future. TeleNav also diversified its revenue base -
 during the quarter, Sprint and AT&T represented 36% and 34% of revenues respectively, down from 44% and 40% in the December
 quarter.

 Automotive Picking Up Steam
 During the quarter, TeleNav inked a new agreement with Ford that allows TeleNav to recognize revenue as soon as a TeleNav-enabled
 car rolls off the assembly line. Available in 4 cars today, the TeleNav/Ford My Touch system is gaining momentum. Ford accounted
 for 13% of revenues in the third quarter, but this was largely impacted by the $6.6M one-time payment. Adjusting for this, we estimate
 Ford would have accounted for less than 2% of revenues in the quarter. Still, TeleNav expects Ford to be one of TeleNav's largest and
 growing customers (but will not account for more than 10% of revenues in the June quarter).

 Management Raises Guidance
 In addition to posting a strong 3Q, TeleNav increased its guidance for the remainder of the year. With only 1 quarter remaining in the
 fiscal  year,  TeleNav  raised  revenue  guidance  by  more  than  5%.  See  Exhibits  2  &  3  for  a  detailed  look  at  our  estimates  versus
 guidance.

 Net net
 TeleNav's  results  were  better  than  expected,  even  when  the  $6.6M  of  one-time  revenues  is  factored-in.  The  company  is  growing
 revenues at a faster than expected rate by increasing its market reach for mobile navigation, selling more premium LBS services and
 through its growing automotive business. We still have some long-term concerns about the competitive environment, but without
 question we are getting increasingly confident that new revenue sources (advertising, automotive and new carrier partnerships) can
 help to mitigate this risk. We are maintaining our Neutral rating, but we are increasing our target to $11 after rolling it forward to fiscal
 2012 (calendar June 2012) and on better revenue growth.

 Changes to our model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by 5.1%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising GAAP EPS
 to $0.92 from $0.80.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
