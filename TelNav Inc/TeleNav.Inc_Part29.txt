 TeleNav Renegotiates Sprint Agreement

 TeleNav  agreed  to  a  new  a  contract  with  Sprint  that  will  provide  a  fixed  guaranteed  fee  to  TeleNav  for  bundled  subscribers  and
 potential  upside  from  unbundled  subs  and  additional  services.  While  the  deal  removes  a  major  near-term  overhang,  the  one-year
 extension means similar issues could arise in 12 - 18 months. Additionally, the company's contract with AT&T, which accounts for
 35% of TeleNav's revenues today expires in March 2011.

    Terms of the Agreement
 The contract is extended to YE2012 from YE2011, while Sprint's right to terminate the agreement is extended from YE2010 to June
 2012. TeleNav's preferred supplier status for navigation apps was broadened and extended through 2012 from YE2010. For TeleNav,
 the new contract terms allow the company's navigation services to be extended to a larger subscriber base, with the thought that the
 larger sub base can equate to higher value and additional LBS opportunities in the future. Sprint may now bundle TeleNav's navigation
 services  with  prepaid  plans,  and  because  Sprint  pays  a  guaranteed  fixed  fee  for  navigation  applications  provided  to  bundled
 subscribers, it is likely to make the service available to as many subscribers as the contractual limits provide. In addition, TeleNav can
 generate additional revenue (rev share) from unbundled subs, enterprise LBS customers, and by offering other services, such as mobile
 advertising, to a larger base of customers. The amendments are retroactive to September 1, 2010.

 Additionally, the company renegotiated its agreement with Tele Atlas, which provides map and Point Of Information (POI) services to
 TeleNav. The adjustments should reduce costs for TeleNav. According to the new terms, TeleNav will pay fees related to navigation
 services to Sprint's bundled customers as a percentage of fees collected from Sprint. Previously, fees to Tele Atlas were based on
 monthly fees per user or fees per transaction. The contract expires in July 2014, but terms related to Sprint's bundled offerings expire
 with the expiration of TeleNav's deal with Sprint. The amendments are retroactive to August 1, 2010.

    Guidance
 Management left fiscal 1Q11 guidance unchanged, despite the fact that the new Sprint agreement will go into effect retroactively to
 September 1. We think better than expected uptake of the service (especially at Sprint) in the first two months of the quarter, coupled
 with the cost declines associated with the Tele Atlas renegotiation, makes it possible for management to maintain 1Q guidance (see
 Exhibit 1 for details).

 However, management provided fiscal year 2011 guidance (see Exhibit 2) that was below our estimates (revenue guidance was about
 10% below our prior forecast). We had previously modeled a 20% decline in Sprint ARPU as a result of the renegotiation, but we had
 this decline occurring in fiscal 3Q11. While the pricing terms of the renegotiated deal were not made available, we believe the new
 contract works out to a price cut of just over 30% based on the our assumed, current Sprint subscriber count.

    Our Take On The News
 The new agreement with Sprint removes the single biggest investor concern; however, in doing so it raises some new questions. First,
 the agreement was only extended 1 year while Sprint's right to terminate was extended 18 months. This means that in 12-18 months,
 revenues from Sprint could be in question again. Second, while TeleNav will straight-line the revenues earned from Sprint over the
 contract period, we do not know for sure if the cash revenues are increasing or decreasing over time and at what rate. Because of this,
 it is difficult to know how Sprint will value the agreement at the end of the contract. Finally, despite Sprint remaining a preferred
 provider, the competitive risks remain as larger players with deep pockets continue to express interest in mobile LBS services. We do
 think that management is making the right moves to remain a big player in mobile LBS, however. Building a large subscriber base and
 making its brand name known can go a long way to helping it secure mobile advertising contracts and making its portal a go-to place
 for mobile search.

    Updates To Our Model
 We are lowering our estimates in conjunction with the newly provided fiscal 2011 guidance. We are reducing our fiscal 2011 revenue
 estimate by just over 10%, and lowering GAAP EPS to $0.53 from $0.88. Our target price remains $6, but is no longer based on a
 probability weighted set of scenarios for the Sprint renegotiation outcome. Instead, it is based on a discounted cash flow analysis
 through 2015 - consistent with the way we analyze other companies in our coverage universe (see page 8 for details). Our assumptions
 include  a  cost  of  capital  of  16.0%  and  a  3.0%  terminal  growth  rate.  Note  that  our  prior  DCF  analysis  of  our  base  case  (see  our
 initiation report dated September 10 for details) yielded a per share value of $7 prior to adjusting for various Sprint scenarios. We
 continue to rate TeleNav Neutral.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
