INVESTMENT RISK 
Tesla faces intense competition from established auto OEMs, execution risk 
for   Model   S,   lack   of   widespread   EV   adoption,   potential   reduction   in 
government support and continued operating losses.   
 
VALUATION METHODOLOGY

$19 target price is the average relative multiples and our DCF - using 15x 
terminal EBITDA multiple and 14% WACC.
