                                          New Bakken and Los Angeles organic growth projects added  
                                          TLLP announced 3 new additional projects              totalling $8MM with expected incremental 
                                          EBITDA of $2MM. In total, TLLP’s organic growth budget is $28MM, expected to generate 
                                          $11MM of EBITDA or an attractive 2.5x multiple . Of the 3 new projects, 2 are in the Bakken. 
                                          The $3MM Rangeland interconnect project will co nnect TLLP’s High Plains pipeline system 
                                          to Rangeland’s North Dakota terminal and pipe line. Expected in-service date is 2Q12. The 
                                          second Bakken project is the $5MM Connelly gathering hub, which will build a new 
                                          gathering hub to support future crude gathering  expansions. The initial pipeline is expected 
                                          to transport 1,500 bpd of crude by 2Q12, replacing some volumes currently trucked. The 
                                          third new project is expanding the LA terminal  capacity by 5,000 bpd. The project has no 
                                          cost as it only requires a permit. Expected EBITDA is $1MM and in-service date is 1Q12.

                                          First dropdown slated for 4Q11/1Q12, sooner than we expected 
                                          Management announced that the first dropdown should be announced “in the coming 
                                          months.” While no further color was provided, such   as size or type of asset, we view the 
                                          news favorably as providing visibility on growth via drops. We are changing our estimate for 
                                          a 2013 drop to a 1Q12 dropdown at $50MM. Given TLLP’s low leverage, $100MM of 
                                          availability on its revolver and reasonably high  coverage, we believe it is likely no equity will 
                                          need to be raised, assuming the transaction is approximately $50MM.

Primary Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price) 
Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 12-Aug-2011, USD 24.20), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sector (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i        n an advisory
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. 
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "sector coverage universe":
