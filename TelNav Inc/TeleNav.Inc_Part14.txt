    Highlights From the Conference Call

 Positive Notables
   TeleNav and AT&T extended their existing contract by 2 years. The contract was up for auto-renewal in March, and the extension
    provides TeleNav with access to AT&T's subscriber base on the same terms as before until 2013.
   Financial results were ahead of expectations; TeleNav beat our estimates and guidance for all key financial metrics.
   Subscriber results were also better than expected. TeleNav provided service to an average of 19.6M subscribers in the quarter, ahead
    of our 19.2M estimate. TeleNav exited the quarter providing service to more than 20 million subscribers.
   Management raised its outlook for fiscal 2011. The midpoint of 2011 revenue guidance was raised by 4.2% while the midpoint of
    net income guidance was raised over 19%. The company also raised gross margin guidance by 100 basis points. See Exhibits 2 and
    3, below, for a comparison of TeleNav's guidance to our estimates.
   TeleNav  signed  an  agreement  with  Delphi  to  bring  TeleNav's  navigation  software  to  select  models  from  a  global  vehicle
    manufacturer.
   TeleNav is growing its mobile advertising business. During the quarter, TeleNav increased its base of mobile advertisers by 50% to
    750,000. TeleNav's click-through rates remained high at 3.6% while drive to rates exceeded 24%.
   The  company  is  looking  to  grow  new  markets  and  technologies  through  M&A.  TeleNav  has  hired  a  new  VP  of  Corporate
    Development and Strategy who will lead TeleNav's strategic M&A efforts. On the call, management noted that they could use M&A
    both to extend their offerings internationally and also to add new technologies to the core product offerings.

 Negative Notables
   Operating  expenses  grew  meaningfully  this  quarter  and  are  expected  to  grow  again  in  fiscal  3Q11.  TeleNav  saw  growth  in
    compensation costs both from headcount increases and from greater competition for talent. R&D expenses grew as the company
    continues to explore new technologies and services.
   Despite management's assurances that TeleNav is not seeing a material impact from free navigation offerings, the competitive risks
    from these services remain.

 Net Net
 TeleNav's results were better than expected, the updated 2011 guidance should result in numbers moving up across the street, and the
 AT&T contract extension resolves one overhang. The longer-term risks of future carrier renegotiations and competition from other
 (free) navigation services remain, but we are getting increasingly confident that new revenue sources (advertising, automotive and
 enterprise LBS) can help to mitigate this risk. We are maintaining our Neutral rating, but we are increasing our target to $8 on better
 long-term revenue growth.

 Changes to Our Model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by 4%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising GAAP EPS
 to $0.80 from $0.69.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
