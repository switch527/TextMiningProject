                                      •   Panasonic's $30MM Investment in Tesla:  The recent $30MM investment by 
                                          Panasonic in TSLA equity offers yet another (in addition Daimlers and 
                                          Toyotas) piece of a strong TSLA technology validation in our view. Panasonic is 
                                          the world's leading supplier of small format lithium battery cells, and Panasonic 
                                          (starting with its Sanyo subsidiary) has had deep commercial links with Tesla for 
                                          six years. It is interesting to note that despite the investment, TSLA is not 
                                          required to sole source batteries from Panasonic (the Model S batteries will be 
                                          dual sourced, and we suspect TSLA is searching for another non-Japanese 
                                          supplier, partly to limit Yen exposure). The CEO described the Panasonic 
                                          investment as an endorsement of TSLA's technology and a sign of "friendship" 
                                          between the two companies. Practically speaking, Panasonic was already TSLAs 
                                          preferred battery vendor, and Panasonic  batteries will be the primary source for 
                                          batteries to the Model S, and the packs for the EV versions of the Daimler smart, 
                                          Mercedes A-Class, and the Toyota RAV4. More strategically, having Panasonic 
                                          directly invested in TSLA's future prov  ides a greater level of confidence that 
                                          TSLA will be able to further reduce battery cost per kwh, particularly relevant for 
                                          the third-gen car to follow the Model S.  

                                      •   TSLA could announce partnership wi          th one more global automaker:     
                                          Management mentioned that TLSA is in discussions with several automotive 
                                          companies for potential commercial relationships, but stayed away from specifics 
                                          except to say that at least one additional relationship (in addition to Daimler and 
                                          Toyota) was likely. We think this is a positive, as it would indicate that up to 
                                          three traditional carmakers are seeing the virtues of Tesla's low cost battery 
                                          technology.  

                                      •   Model-S vehicle and launch updates: A few incremental points discussed in the 
                                          call regarding launch of Model-S in mid-2012 are listed below:        (1) Mgmt. 
                                          seemed confident on the mid-2012 launch timing and 20K volume in 2013 of 
                                          Model-S vehicles and suggested that final systems integration (particularly 
                                          related to crash testing) was one of the  major areas of risks to launch timing.  (2) 
                                          Nearly 100% of supplier sourcing decisions are expected to be done by end of 
                                          4Q:10. (3) Management suggested that TSLA is making good progress towards 
                                          an 80kW fast charger (the default chargers with Model S will be a 10kW or 
                                          20kW charger) which will require  just 45 minutes of charge Model-S (70kWh 
                                          battery pack to be charged up-to 85%). Company is expecting to make these 
                                          chargers available with the launch of Model-S and is now planning to install 
                                          these chargers in public roadways.   (4) TSLA signaled it made some modest 
                                          design tweaks to the Model S in recent m onths (eg, a Panoramic roof option, and

                                     •   Toyota RAV4 Details: Toyota earlier announced to plan to jointly develop a EV 
                                          power-train for its future RAV4. TSLA mentioned that this contract will generate 
                                          $60MM of development revenues and that it will be realized over 6 quarters after 
                                          the commencement of the contract (which we suspect is sometime early next 
                                          year). TSLA will also derive an additional $9MM of revenues to develop a 
                                          prototype RAV4 for Toyota.  Mgmt. suggeste d that there are a lot of similarities 
                                          between Model S and RAV4 power-trains but with a different systems 
                                          integration challenge. Core IP in RAV4 development will be owned by TSLA 
                                          and system integration related IP will generally be owned by Toyota. Company 
                                          also mentioned that RAV4 will have a 40kWh battery pack (smaller than Model-
                                          S 70kWh), similar to Mercedes A-cla    ss. It was suggested that RAV4 may 
                                          initially be manufactured in NUMMI plant and may eventually be moved to 
                                          Toyota plant depending on the volumes.

                                      Valuation 
                                      We get to our $30 Dec-11 price target using both a DCF (11.7% discount rate, 4% 
                                      terminal growth, exclusive of 2011 burn) and price/sales (1.4x which is the 1.5x 
                                      average 2012 p/sales of A123, Ener1, BYD discounted one year as we apply it to 
                                      Teslas 2013 sales). Our $30 price target implies a somewhat lofty 26.1x P/E on tax 
                                      rate adjusted 2013 EPS, although implied P/E is 16.5x if 10% EBIT margin is used 
                                      (our margin forecast may be conservative at  least in the initial years (guidance is 14-
                                      16%). Since its 2003 start, Tesla has been singularly focused on developing pure 
                                      electric vehicles (EVs). We think EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) both hold strong 
                                      long-term promise given tightening environment regulations and an increasingly 
                                      green global consumer. Maintain Overweight. 

                                      Risk to Rating 
                                      Downside Risks: (1) Established luxury carmakers introduce competing vehicles that 
                                      eventually prove performance and cost competitive to Teslas technology. Audi, for 
                                      example, is targeting a 2012 launch of its   E-tron EV ultra luxu ry sports car, and 
                                      Mercedes and Porsche have pure EV sp orts car plans in the works as well.  (2) The 
                                      manufacturing ramp of Model S is delayed notably.        (3)  Model S sales start 
                                      cannibalizing Roadster sales. (4) Elon Musk (CEO) is a key executive whose loss to 
                                      the company could potentially be fairly detrimental (he has a history of moving on 
                                      once companies become successful). We see  him as a visionary who drives Tesla to 
                                      high technical and commercial targets.

Initiated coverage Aug 09, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
