      IBM deal vindicates market opportunit        y, and view this strengthening existing         
      partnership, and potentially opening ne  w revenue opportunities with IBM over 
      time. We view recurring revenue organic growth of 29%, in-line with last qtrs 
      28%, as solid, and we think current 4Q es timates of total organic revenue growth 
      is 18% and organic recurring revenue growth of 20% in 4Q, could be conservative 
      given current momentum 
      MDM, international expansion and current partner investments could lead 
      upside in 2012 
      MDM represents <10% of revenue, and could benefit from enterprise adoption of 
      greater number of mobile form factors.  They continue to benefit from the major 
      2Q product release and clos ed biz with Expedia, Biog en, AmerisourceBergen and 
      PWC. The company continues to invest internationally (intnl biz is up 37% y/y) and 
      believe new investments could potentially  see greater revenue contribution from 
      APAC in 2012, like Europe in 2011. We bel  ieve recent partner additions like HP 
      and ACS (broke into Xerox this quarter) are beginning to ramp, and their full impact 
      can be seen only in 2012. We are raising revenue estimates for higher business 
      momentum, but maintain EPS expectations  as we expect much of upside to be 
      fueled back to drive growth. 
      Reiterate Buy and raise target to $18 (from $17) 
      Our $18 price target is based on a CY13           uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
      EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.1x (slight       premium to the peer group given market 
      leadership), and an estimated five-year gr  owth rate, net of dilution, of 30% (up 
      from 26%). Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
      profitability from new projects not ramp  ing fast enough and customers taking 
      expense processing inhouse after early gains from Tangoes platform.

                                 Tangoe reported 3Q results with revenue           /EPS of $27.3m/$0.07 versus our/streets 
                                 $26.5m/$0.06 estimate. The company continue  s to expand the nascent communications 
                                 lifecycle management (CLM) market (spend managed is up 6% q/q), and the large multi-
                                 million dollar IBM deal vindicates market oppo  rtunity. Estimated organic recurring revenue 
                                 growth of 28% came above our expectations,   and we view current 2011 expectations as 
                                 conservative. We are raising estimates for  higher momentum. Reiterate our buy rating and 
                                 raise target to $18 (from $17). 

                                 Guidance: 
                                      Fourth Quarter 2011 Guidance: Total revenue  is expected to be in the range of $27.5 
                                      million to $27.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.2 million to 
                                      $3.4 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.07 based on 38.5 million 
                                      weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.  
                                      Full Year 2011 Guidance: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $103.2 million 
                                      to $103.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected  to be in the range of $12.2 million to 
                                      $12.4 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected        to be approximately $0.25 based on 33.7 
                                      million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.

                                 Expanding lead in nascent market; large IBM win vindicates market opportunity 
                                 Tangoe continues to penetrate the growing ma  rket for CLM with about $15.3b in spend 
                                 managed (up 6% q/q) within an estimated   potential TAM of $425b globally. The company 
                                 added 25 new customers, in-line with 2Q, and   within range of targeted 25 -30 customers, 
                                 and also had up-sell into major customers, both including Motorola, BlueCoat, Honeywell and 
                                 Novartis. The large multi-million dollar internal  IBM deal vindicates ma rket opportunity, and 
                                 view this strengthening exis      ting partnership, and pote     ntially opening new revenue 
                                 opportunities with IBM over time. We view recu rring revenue organic growth of 29%, in-line 
                                 with last qtrs 28%, as solid,  and we think current 4Q estima  tes of total organic revenue 
                                 growth is 18% and organic recurring revenue growth of 20% in 4Q, could be conservative 
                                 given current momentum.

                                 2012 
                                 MDM represents <10% of revenue, and could benefit from enterprise adoption of greater 
                                 number of mobile form factors. They continue  to benefit from the major 2Q product release 
                                 and closed biz with Expedia,  Biogen, AmerisourceBergen and PWC. The company continues 
                                 to invest internationally (int  nl biz is up 37% y/y) and      believe new investments could 
                                 potentially see greater revenue  contribution from APAC in  2012, like Europe in 2011. We 
                                 believe recent partner additions like HP and ACS (broke into Xerox this quarter) are beginning 
                                 to ramp, and their full impact can be seen on ly in 2012. We are raising revenue estimates for

                                         Reiterate Buy and raise target to $18 (from $17) 

                                         Our $18 price target is based on a CY13 uF                   CF/share estimate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G 
                                         multiple of 1.1x (slight premium to the peer group given market leadership), and an estimated 
                                         five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 30%  (up from 26%, as we see current investments 
                                         pushing out higher cash flow margins over time) 

                                         Risks 

                                         Risks include execution risk fr         om integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
                                         projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing inhouse after 
                                         early gains from Tangoes platform.

Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or otherwise, in a manner inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including strategists and 
sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent  with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this  report constitute the current judgement of  the author as of the  date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
