                                           Executive Summary
                                           Having  consolidated  a  significant  number  of  smaller  competitors,  and  expanded  its  suite

                                           (MDM), Tangoe has become a one stop Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM)
                                           provider.  In  our  view,  as  a  SaaS  sector  dominator,  in  an  attractive  and  large  space,
                                           the companys accelerated revenue and earnings growth, combined with its recurring and
                                           predictable financial model, create a compelling investment that should outperform the broader
                                           market. Against this backdrop, we are initiating coverage of Tangoe with a Buy rating and
                                           $30.00 target price. We see the shares as a solid core holding for growth-oriented investors.

                                           Key Investment Highlights

                                           Leader in SaaS tools for very large market. Tangoe is well established as the leading
                                           global SaaS provider of Telecom Expense Management (TEM) solutions for enterprise and
                                           mid-market companies. Having moved from fixed-line and datacom-centric solutions into the
                                           wireless expense management arena, Tangoe more recently broadened to also manage end-user
                                           devices in the mobile world, an emerging segment termed Mobile Device Management (MDM).
                                           In our view, Tangoes tools can be marketed to virtually any Global 5000 enterprise customer,
                                           and to the bulk of the global mid-market to create a very large market opportunity with only
                                           minimal penetration to date. With Tangoe currently the largest scaled vendor while still serving
                                           only roughly 700 customers, we see the space as a true "multi-billion dollar" opportunity long-
                                           term. The competitive environment is largely addressed currently by small regional service
                                           providers with manually-intensive business models as contrasted to Tangoe's highly automated
                                           processes.

                                           Proven cost cutter for customers, with control improvements also. Tangoes TEM solutions
                                           are designed to rapidly discover cost savings for customers, from reducing unused lines to
                                           improving rate plan selection. With systems in place, customers also gain greater control over
                                           service usage, end-user devices and applications to bolster its overall value-add. More recent
                                           capabilities even allow for real-time spend management optimization to avoid problems such
                                           as sudden usage spikes or unplanned international service requirements that previously might
                                           have resulted in large (but avoidable) billing increases.

                                           Highly  visible,  recurring  revenue  model.  As  a  SaaS-based  revenue  model  (albeit  with
                                           professional services as a natural component of revenues), the volatility of quarterly licensing
                                           revenues of legacy software providers has been replaced by a highly predictable revenue and
                                           earnings model. Long-term, we believe overall predictability should prove to be strong and
                                           supportive of a premium valuation versus growth-oriented companies who typically lack such
                                           visibility.

                                           Solid organic growth rate and proven acquisition history. Despite intense macroeconomic
                                           pressures, Tangoes revenues grew organically over 20% in both 2010 and 2011. Tangoe has
                                           also executed a clear "roll-up" strategy in its core TEM space by applying its technology-driven
                                           solutions to competitors' manual-centric business models. With 4Q11 reported revenue growth
                                           of 56.6% attesting to the scaling benefits of these efforts, we believe this strategy warrants
                                           a premium valuation for Tangoe, particularly in light of the consistently accretive outcomes
                                           demonstrated.

                                           forecast to increase nearly 3x from 2010 to 2012 (to $20.2 million in 2012 versus $6.9 million in
                                           2010), Tangoe is solidly profitable and on the cusp of an earnings breakout, in our view. With an
                                           acquisitive history, the balance sheet was moderately leveraged pre-IPO, but IPO and follow-
                                           on proceeds have cut debt roughly 50% to $16.2 million versus cash reserves now estimated at
                                           $81.3 million to yield roughly $1.60 in net cash per share.

Tangoe, Inc.                                                                                                              April 5, 2012

                                           Valuation Framework

                                           Primary near-term factor is expected revenue multiple expansion. We view Tangoe as
                                           having category killer status in the TEM market, and as a solid player in the fast emerging
                                           MDM space. With solid profitability and organic growth well established, we believe the
                                           company should become a premium player in terms of valuation in the SaaS space, although
                                           a limited track record has likely gated this move somewhat. In our view, its ability to augment
                                           solid organic growth with a well-defined and proven accretive acquisition strategy should
                                           garner a premium valuation. Currently trading at roughly 5.9x run-rate revenues (net of net
                                           cash), matching its peer average of 5.9x, investors willing to buy early and hold through the
                                           development of a solid guidance and execution history could be well rewarded by sharply higher
                                           valuation multiples on an increasing revenue base over time. Our price target of $30.00 assumes
                                           a 7.5x run-rate revenues multiple (arguing for a 25% premium for its accretive acquisition
                                           strategy) applied to our 4Q12 forecast and adds an estimated net cash reserve adjustment.

                                           Too early to focus on EPS, but does offer defensibility, in our view. While we view it as
                                           too early to focus on an earnings-driven valuation given its accelerated organic growth phase
                                           and only early-stage overall profitability (operating margins in 4Q11 were just 4.1% but did
                                           increase over 250 basis points year over year), pro forma EPS can be used, in our view, as a
                                           backstop in terms of valuation defensibility. Run-rate pro forma EPS in 4Q11 were $0.32, to
                                           yield an implied pro forma P/E (net of cash reserves of roughly $1.60 per share) of roughly 53x,
                                           essentially inline with the 57% revenue growth rate reported for 4Q11. As we typically apply a
                                           1.5 PEG to account for superior predictability in the SaaS space, the "core P/E multiple" (pre-
                                           PEG) could be implied at 35x. With pro forma EPS up over 100% in 2011 (to $0.26 versus $0.12
                                           in 2010 if using a normalized sharecount to improve the comparisons' fairness), the multiples
                                           (pre-PEG or not) are defensible in our view. Perhaps more importantly, looking forward, our
                                           4Q12 run-rate pro forma EPS forecast of $0.56 would imply a P/E of roughly 30x (or 20x with
                                           a PEG of 1.5x) at current trading levels, a well defensible multiple in our view.

                                           Company Description

                                           Tangoe, Inc. (TNGO) was founded in 2000 and is based in Orange, Connecticut. Venture-
                                           backed by Edison Ventures, Sevin Rosen Funds, Investor Growth Capital and North Atlantic
                                           Capital, Tangoe is the leading global provider of SaaS-based telecommunications expense
                                           management (TEM) solutions that help enterprise and mid-market customers lower their costs
                                           and increase the controls over their telecommunications and data communications assets,
                                           in both fixed-line and wireless environments. With the proliferation of intelligent wireless
                                           devices increasing the complexity of supporting wireless deployments, Tangoe has extended
                                           its solutions to also address Mobile Device Management (MDM), to create an end-to-end
                                           solution suite for Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM). Today, Tangoe has run-rate
                                           revenues of roughly $117 million and more than 800 employees supporting over 700 customers
                                           worldwide. End customer spending managed by its systems totals over $15 billion and over 2
                                           million end-user wireless devices are managed by its applications.

                                           Complex  problems  underserved  by  manual  outsourcing  players.  The  complexity  of
                                           administering  to  telecommunications  spending  should  not  be  underestimated.  Looked  at
                                           simply, even a company with as few as 500 "white collar" employees could be forced to
                                           deal with as many as 15,000-20,000 bills per year (assuming each is billed monthly for one
                                           desk phone, one mobile phone and one data connection for a total of up to 36 bills per
                                           year each). With rate and billing complexity for telecommunications exacerbated by issues
                                           related to volumes (with time of day and seasonal variations for example) and geographies
                                           (international currencies and languages and rates varying greatly versus domestic geographies)

Tangoe, Inc.                                                                                                                April 5, 2012

                                            and even technologies (compatibility-driven or even user-driven such as applet downloading
                                            and billing), and multiplied by the number of vendors chosen globally, the manual approach to
                                            billing outsourcing employed by many companies leaves most issues unaddressed. In manual
                                            outsourcing situations, business partners typically aggregate only basic datasets to forward to
                                            payables departments, leaving optimization efforts largely unsupported.

                                            Automation is key to success in TEM. In Tangoe's case, it has deployed a global infrastructure
                                            (with 88 global invoice processing centers covering over 180 countries) that is capable not only
                                            of capturing and integrating raw digital billing feeds (as would be expected perhaps in most
                                            "G20"-type countries), but also of efficiently converting paper-based bills into digital feeds by
                                            using automated optical conversion technologies. This infrastructure investment leaves Tangoe
                                            uniquely capable of preserving and using virtually all billing data within its SaaS-based analytic
                                            engine for future billing and vendor optimization and selection efforts.

                                            In terms of scale, we note that Tangoe processes roughly 500,000 invoices monthly on behalf
                                            of its customers (in 16 languages and more than 125 currencies currently). With challenges
                                            exacerbated by the need to support over 60 global regulatory agencies, we beleive the barriers
                                            to building a truly global telecommunications expense management engine to compete with
                                            Tangoe are extremely high.

                                            Very large end-market should see strong adoption given high ROI. From a target market
                                            perspective, while Tangoe derives the bulk of its revenues from large enterprises (roughly 50%
                                            of revenues come from its top 100 customers who are typically Global 2000 enterprises, it also
                                            services the global mid-market. In our view, the Global 5000 should virtually all be strong target
                                            customers (with telecom/datacom a nearly ubiquitous requirement for modern companies to
                                            compete in the global market) as should mid-market companies (which we see totaling several
                                            hundred thousand companies as we estimate as many as 250,000 companies have, for example,
                                            adopted mid-market ERP solutions over the past two decades). Overall, while impossible to
                                            accurately gauge, we are confident that Tangoe's end market represents a true "multi-billion
                                            dollar" market opportunity. To support this claim we note that average revenues per customer
                                            tend to be much higher than in most SaaS verticals, with its Top 35 customers averaging more
                                            than $1.0 million per year and its Top 100 averaging roughly $600,000. Its overall average
                                            revenue per customer is in the $150,000-$200,000 range to leave even moderate penetration
                                            of the global enterprise and mid-markets capable of driving billions in annual revenues over
                                            the long-term.

                                            From an ROI perspective, the company notes that its ability to cut costs (by improving rate
                                            plans and eliminating unused telecom/datacom lines, for example) can in many cases result in
                                            payback periods of six months or less, an analysis we see supported by its very high customer
                                            retention level (at above 95% annually to come in at the upper-end of all SaaS players). We
                                            believe the ubiquity of telecom/datacom usage globally, tied to its strong customer ROI argues
                                            not only for a large market, but for a strong likelihood of high customer adoption rates long-
                                            term.

                                            Mobile  Device  Management  offers  complementary  offering  to  core  telecom  expense
                                            management. With wireless devices becoming ever "smarter," they are also becoming more
                                            difficult to administer to for corporations. While "dumb mobile phones" could largely be treated
                                            the same as fixed telecom lines, phones that can now download fee-based applications (and even
                                            viruses) offer unique new management problems for both technical and financial optimization.
                                            With its 2008 acquisition of privately-held Telwares, Tangoe moved into the Mobile Device
                                            Management (MDM) space. While we view this space as highly fragmented and competitive
                                            (with many private and public companies looking to compete in it today), we see Tangoe's
                                            unique ability to bridge between billing data and device control as a clear advantage. We view
                                            this as an upside market (and financial) opportunity currently, with its TEM space primarily

                                            Financial Model - Factors & Forecasts

                                            Factors

                                            Key factors driving Tangoe's financial model are as follows.

                                            1. Recurring revenue-driven. As a subscription-oriented revenue model, as opposed to the
                                            former licensing model that dominated the software industry for decades, Tangoes revenues
                                            (and in turn earnings) have high predictability and stability, with a strong, sequential-growth
                                            bias. While its services and consulting revenues are not recurring, they represented only 11% of
                                            2011 total revenues to minimize their volatizing impact. This recurring revenue model supports
                                            a strong tendency to achieve record revenues both annually and sequentially (our model notes
                                            no sequentially lower quarters dating back to at least 2008; prior years dating back to 2005 also
                                            carry unbroken year over year growth). We see no factors likely to change this pattern going
                                            forward and note that no customers represent a material portion of revenues.

                                            2. Organic growth augmented by acquisitions. While not immune to the recessions impacts,
                                            Tangoe continued to report solid organic growth of more than 20% in each of the past two years.
                                            In addition, Tangoe has been a serial acquirer of both competing companies and complementary
                                            product offerings. While at times strategic product acquisitions could prove to add minimally
                                            to revenues and/or earnings (or could potetnially even prove mildly dilutive), the company's
                                            competitive acquisitions fit a clear "roll-up" strategy by being rapidly accretive. Tangoe has
                                            a solid global foundation built upon highly automated business processes (such as optical
                                            scanning of paper-based bills in international geographies) and advanced software engines to
                                            provide its services. While its competitors continue to rely on manually-intensive data entry and
                                            analysis methods, Tangoe can typically increase the profitability of its acquisitions both rapidly
                                            and materially. As such, we would expect (and hope) to see a continuation of its roll-up strategy
                                            both domestically (its primary focus to date) and internationally (noting its recent U.K.-based
                                            acquisition of ttMobiles in February 2012). In our view, the faster Tangoe can identify and
                                            complete these types of acquisitions the better as they should offer steady upside to base-line
                                            forecasts which cannot anticipate the timing and impact of the accretion that would be expected.

                                            3. Gross margins below SaaS peers but should trend higher on steady-state basis. Blended
                                            gross margins in 4Q11 were 53%, a level well below many pure-play SaaS players in other
                                            vertical markets. The global infrastructure Tangoe has deployed to enable the ability to capture
                                            and digitize telecom bills across the world (regardless of language and currency) offers a cost
                                            to operations that is well above that of many SaaS-based models. However, it also offers large
                                            competitive barriers to entry and scale. Long-term, as Tangoe scales from the current "hundreds
                                            of customers" scale (over 700 now) to the thousands, we expect steady increases to overall
                                            gross margins and profitability on a steady-state basis (once acquisitions are fully integrated
                                            and optimized to augment organic growth). Periodically however, we note that acquisitions
                                            will likely result in dampened near-term gross margins prior to integration and optimization.

                                            4. Earnings poised for solid growth. With revenues setting consistent record highs, and
                                            growth (organic and acquisition-driven) remaining at a highly accelerated pace (4Q11 revenues
                                            were up 56.6%), pro forma earnings have demonstrated a strong "stair step" pattern over the past
                                            few years (adjusted net income has risen sequentially every quarter since 4Q08). In aggregate,
                                            adjusted net income scaled over 100% in 2011 to $8.8 million versus $3.5 million in 2010, or
                                            to $0.26 per share in 2011 versus roughly $0.12 in 2010 (using a "normalized" sharecount to
                                            improve comparisons pre-IPO). Our $0.42 pro forma EPS forecast for 2012 would still offer
                                            greater than 60% upside versus 2011.

Tangoe, Inc.                                                                                                                April 5, 2012

                                            Forecasts
                                            2012

                                            Combining the above factors, we are forecasting record 2012 revenues of $142.3 million, up
                                            35.6% year-over-year, to drive record pro forma EPS of $0.42 (up 60% versus the prior record
                                            of $0.26 in 2011). By contrast to the unbroken sequential adjusted net income pattern that dates
                                            back to 2008, our model presumes a one quarter narrow de-leveraging (modeled essentially
                                            flat at $2.96 million in 1Q12 versus $3.02 million in 4Q11) as a result of early year spending
                                            and acquisition impacts, although we would not be greatly surprised to see upside ot our model
                                            result in another sequentially higher quarter. This forecast leaves pro forma EPS estimated flat
                                            sequentially at $0.08 for 1Q12 before returning to a sequential growth pattern thereafter (up
                                            $0.01 sequentially in 2Q12 to $0.09, $0.02 higher in 3Q12 to $0.11 and $0.03 higher in 4Q12
                                            to $0.14) to leave run-rate pro forma EPS of $0.56 exiting the year.

                                            2013
                                            Looking out to 2013, we are forecasting record revenues of $170.0 million, up 19.5% year-
                                            over-year, to drive pro forma EPS of $0.58. With no ability to know if/when strategic or
                                            complementary acquisitions are timed, we simply focus on the development of a steady-state
                                            model to leave its accretive acquisition roll-up strategy as an (expected) upside driver. As
                                            a steady-state model, we assume recurring revenues grow 20%, but model services grow
                                            at a slower 15% rate. We see gross margins trending slowly higher, forecast at 54.9% for
                                            2013 versus the 53.5% we forecast for 2012. In terms of fairness as forecasts, we note that
                                            gross margins have been as high as 56.3% in 2010 prior to certain investment and acquisition
                                            dampeners. Again, given a solidly sequentially higher earnings bias, we view run-rate pro forma
                                            EPS as more important that actual annual forecasts and note that our 4Q13 forecast results in a
                                            run-rate earnings level of $0.64 per share. From an upside perspective, with only minor organic
                                            and acquisition-driven upside over the next 12-18 months, we believe run-rate pro forma EPS
                                            could actually scale well higher, with for example, only $1.6 million in quarterly adjusted net
                                            income upside required to drive run-rate pro forma EPS to as high as $0.80 exiting 4Q12.

                                            Balance Sheet Solid

                                            Tangoe's balance sheet is solid. With adjusted EBITDA forecast to increase over 2.5x from
                                            2010 to 2012 (to $20.2 million in 2012 versus $6.9 million in 2010), Tangoe is solidly profitable
                                            to leave its balance sheet an asset largely available for continued strategic and complementary
                                            acquisitions as has been a long-term focus for the company. The balance sheet was moderately
                                            leveraged pre-IPO, with debt totaling $29.7 million versus cash of $9.0 million in 2Q11. Post
                                            IPO, debt was cut strongly (to $7.3 million exiting 3Q11) but has rebounded moderately as
                                            a result of continued acquisitions to exit 4Q11 at $16.2 million. However, total cash has also
                                            stepped up strongly as an offset, exiting 4Q11 at $43.4 million (including IPO and core cash
                                            generation impacts) and is set to increase to roughly $81 million as a result of its recent follow-
                                            on offering (in which the company sold 2.2 million shares of an 8.0 million share offering).

                                            In our view, with a proven "roll-up" strategy in place, we would expect to see ongoing
                                            acquisitions completed, backed up by sporadic forays into the capital markets to replenish
                                            deployed capital. So long as its acquisitions remain largely focused on buying competing
                                            vendors  in  an  accretive  manner  (with  less  focus  on  strategic  and  potentially  dilutive
                                            acquisitions), we would strenuously support such efforts as a strong avenue to continue to
                                            accelerate its scale and earnings development pace while simultaneously building even greater
                                            barriers to entry.

Valuation/Risks
n  Valuation: TNGO shares trade at 6x 4Q11 run-rate revenues, matching the SaaS average. We see potential upside to its multiple over the year as investors recognize its
   superior growth opportunity and use a 7.5x multiple a year out as the basis for our $30.00 target.
n  Risks: Acquisition integration, acceptance of the SaaS model, and a limited public track record are key investment risks.
