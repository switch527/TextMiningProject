                                   High return expansion projects support growth 
                                   On 12/5, TLLP announced $80mm of new organic projects and its first drop down. 
                                   Combining $11.5mm of EBITDA from previously  announced organic pr ojects, $18.5mm of 
                                   EBITDA from the new organic projects an     d $8mm from the drop down, 2013 EBITDA 
                                   guidance is $100mm, which is higher than our previous $88mm estimate and up 
                                   significantly from TLLP’s current $62mm run rate. The $80mm of new organic projects are 
                                   expected to be done at attractive multiples of 4X EBITDA and backed by long-term 
                                   contracts with TSO.  

                                   New organic projects in Bakken and West Coast terminals 
                                   The $80mm of new organic projects are compri sed of crude gathering and truck volume 
                                   expansions in the Bakken and refined product terminal expansio  ns. In the Bakken, TLLP is 
                                   adding approximately $53mm of new projects to  increase crude gathering capacity on its 
                                   High Plains system and trucking capacity to accommodate TSO’s growing demand for 
                                   Bakken crude. Combining TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan refinery expansion, 30,000 bpd 
                                   Anacortes rail project and gathering expansions in  the Bakken, TLLP’s High Plains system is 
                                   expected to add 50,000 bpd of new volumes by 2013, raising its total volumes to more than 
                                   100,000 bpd.  

                                   On the trucking side, TLLP is expanding its fleet and expects volumes to increase 10,000 
                                   bpd to 35,000 bpd by 2013. In addition, TLLP   lengthened its trucking contract with TSO 
                                   from 2 years to 5 years and increased mini mum volume commitments from 22,000 bpd to 
                                   27,000 bpd in 2012 and 32,000 bpd in 2013. 

                                   The remaining new projects comprise approximately $27mm for terminal expansions at Los 
                                   Angeles, Stockton and Mandan. Including previously announced storage projects, TLLP will 
                                   invest approximately $40mm on terminal projects through 2013, which is expected to 
                                   increase volumes by 40,000 bpd to approximately 185,000 bpd.  

                                   First drop down expected 1Q12, to be debt financed 
                                   Management announced the first drop down will be the Martinez, CA crude oil marine 
                                   terminal serving TSO’s 166,000 bpd Golden Eagle  refinery (TSO’s largest refinery). Expected 
                                   close is 1Q12. While management did not provide a purchase price (terms still being 
                                   discussed), we assume a pric  e tag of approximately $65mm based on 8x multiple on 
                                   EBITDA of $8mm. 

                                   The Martinez crude oil marine terminal is   comprised of 145,000 bpd of wharf capacity, 
                                   425,000 bpd of storage capacity and interconnecting pipes. Similar to other TLLP assets, the 
                                   Martinez terminal cash flows will be supported by a 10-year contract with TSO with 
                                   minimum volume commitment for 90% of projected volumes of 70,000 bpd.   

                                   Given TLLP’s high liquidity and low leverage, we expect the drop down and growth projects 
                                   to be financed with debt.

Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect       or (the "sector
coverage universe"). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i        n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
