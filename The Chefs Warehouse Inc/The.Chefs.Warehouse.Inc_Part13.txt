                                   Areas of focus for the conference call: 

                                           Cadence of sales throughout 1Q in light of some industry data pointing to weakening 
                                            sales in March. 

                                           Sales trends into 2Q12.  

                                           Updated guidance for FY2012. 

                                           The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact due to 
                                            acquisitions and inflation. In addition, some color on trends on unique customers. 

                                           FY2012 capex allocation  the companys 10-K indicated capex would be in the $12.2 
                                            million range in FY2012. 

                                           Update on the new facility that is expected to replace the two existing Bronx facilities. 

                                           Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                            operators that CHEF serves.  

                                           Color on top-line trends and the correlation with rising and falling gas prices.  

                                           Some thoughts on how the changing dynamics of the restaurant industry (smaller plate 
                                            sizes, high growth in tapas-style restaurants, as an example) affect CHEFs approach to 
                                            increasing market share.   

                                           Update on the rollout of engineered labor        standards to the companys facilities. 
                                            Previously, management indicated that the rollout would be complete for all facilities 
                                            except Miami and Portland by the conclusion of 1Q12.

                                        Some color on inflation trends and the companys ability to pass on cost increases to its 
                                         customers.  

                                        Trends in case volumes and revenues per case. 

                                        Managements thoughts on the opportunity for new market entries  specifically, how 
                                         many markets can the company ultimately enter and an outline of the criteria 
                                         management uses to evaluate potential markets. 

                                 Our 1Q12 EPS estimate remains at $0.14 vs. consensus of $0.16         . Our estimate assumes 
                                 total sales increase 19.0% to $98.7 million, driven by 9% organic sales growth, and we assume 
                                 gross margins expand 50bp to 26.3%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 
                                 20.8% to $20.2 million, or a 30bp increase as a pe rcentage of sales to 20.4%, leading to a 31bp 
                                 improvement in operating margins to 5.3%, or $5.2 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $5.9 
                                 million, a 20bp expansion in margin to 5.9%. We assume interest expense of $0.2 million, a 
                                 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.14  a 12.2% 
                                 increase from 1Q11.  

                                 In FY2012, our estimate for EPS is $0.96. Consensus EPS is $0.95. Our EBITDA estimate 
                                 is $38 million . Our estimate assumes total sales increase 13.2% to $453.2 million (vs. 
                                 consensus of $459.0 million), with gross margins improving 49bp to 26.8%. We forecast 
                                 operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 11.9  % to $84.3 million, a 21bp year over year 
                                 improvement in margin  leading to a 65bp improvement in operating margins to 7.7%, or 
                                 $34.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $38 million, a 70bp improvement in margin to 8.2%. 
                                 We assume interest expense of $0.8 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.8 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.96.
