                                     •   Paying subs increased to 16,100 from 14,545 last quarter, representing 69% y/y and 
                                         11% q/q growth. This shows solid growth amid an environment of free turn-by-turn 
                                         competitor offerings. 

                                     •   ARPU of $1.03 vs. $1.11 last year and $1.02 last quarter. The decline was expected 
                                         due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings. 

                                     •   TNAV was selected by U.S. Cellular, the nation’s sixth largest wireless carrier, as a 
                                         GPS navigation partner just after the quarter closed. As part of the deal, TNAV’s turn-
                                         by-turn offering will be bundled with the consumer’s wireless data plan and essentially 
                                         offered for free to data plan subscribers. Although this results in lower ARPU for 
                                         TNAV, it drives a higher subscription base and, ultimately, more revenue. 

                                     •   The company is currently in negotiations with Sprint for potential amendments with 
                                         its current contract. TNAV anticipates any extended agreement would result in ARPU 
                                         declines and reductions in total revenue from Sprint for bundled services, but an 
                                         increase in subs. This was anticipated, and the last time the contract was renegotiated, 
                                         the result was an increase in sub growth and higher total revenue in the ensuing 
                                         period. Prior to this negotiation, TNAV was the exclusive provider of Sprint Navigation 
                                         until December 31, 2010. Management has consistently said it will attempt to 
                                         renegotiate major contracts before their renewals.  

                                     •   Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter was $113M, up from $46M in FQ3/10 
                                         (pre-IPO). Net cash per share increased to $2.69 from $1.21 last quarter.  

                                     •   FQ1/11 revenue/EPS guidance $50M/$0.22 vs. consensus estimates of $49.8M/$0.21.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our $14 target price is based on 7x our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M. We believe 
this represents a very conservative view of what the shares are worth and, from a relative 
valuation standpoint, think the stock can trade into the high-teens with continued 
execution in the coming quarters.  

Investment risks 
Investment risks include, but are not limited to, customer concentration, competition, 
scalability, intellectual property and regulation.
