Investment Thesis: 
 
After touring Teslas operations in the San Francisco Bay Area this week, we have come away more positive on the 
companys long-term future. We believe that Tesla is in the nascent stages of building a viable long-term company 
with a dedicated and growing fan-like customer base. We believe that Teslas role in the auto industry could be 
similar to Apple Inc.s position in the personal computer & electronics industry. 
 
We better realized what a boon the Tesla Fremont factory represents to the company. We see a lot of hidden value 
in the Fremont purchase  it is more than 200 acres of prime real estate in the Bay Area that cost Tesla $42MM. 
Beyond the raw value of the property, this asset will allow Tesla to expand with new models that build upon the 
Model-S platform, including the Model-X, and its third-generation vehicle. 
 
We also came away more confident that Tesla will be able to achieve mid-2012 launch of the Model S.  
 
We have updated several of our near-term and long-term assumptions, giving us a $40 DCF-based price target. We 
note that this price target takes into account an incremental 8MM shares from an expected secondary offering in the 
second half of this year      1.  
 
Key assumption changes are: 
 

                                                           
1 We believe that Tesla may want to raise $100MM to $200MM to jump start its Model X development. However, we do not think this will happen until the 
company has released the beta build of its Model S. We note that Tesla does not need to raise money to bring the Model S to market.

       Margin savings on Fremont plant 
         efficiencies and on producing 
         certain items in house, which saves 
         on outsourcing costs and freight. 
         For instance, the seats will now be 
         made adjacent to the assembly line. 
         This is a new development made 
         possible by the space available at 
         the Fremont factory. Tesla expects 
         that battery improvements could 
         lead to 8% cost savings on batteries 
         annually, or lead to higher energy 
         density per battery, which would 
         also help to drive higher ASPs. We 
         expect 25% gross margins in FY14, 
         which is in line with Teslas 
         guidance. This adds about $4 to our 
         PT. 
 
       Our previous PT did not take into account Teslas partnership with Toyota to supply power trains and 
         battery packs for the RAV4. This $60MM development contract plus initial production orders for 2,500 
         power trains add about $2 to our PT. 
     
       At least 4,800 Model S units sold in FY12, up from zero previously. (We assume a gradual ramp in cars 
         produced per 8-hour work shift, with 1,600 units produced in Q312 and 3,200 produced in Q412. Eventual 
         production will be 80 cars per shift, or 5,000 per quarter.) Internal manufacturing buffers give us confidence 
         that Tesla can produce at least 4,800 units in FY12. We note that the company already has more than 4,000 
         Model S reservations and that each reservation holder has paid at least $5,000 for a refundable deposit. This 
         adds about $1 to our PT. 
 
       A terminal value growth rate of 0.5% after 20 years. This takes into account the next generation of cars 
         beyond Model S and Model X, including a third generation vehicle. At more than 200 acres, the Fremont 
         factory gives the company ample room to expand  Model S production only takes up about 15% of the 
         space. This adds about $1 to our PT. 
 
       The company is now within eight quarters of profitability, which means positive cash flows are closer in 
         time, which benefits the DCF calculation. Beyond the math, we think this PT boost makes sense because 
         Tesla has produced a drivable alpha Model S since we set our $30 PT. This adds $2 to our PT. 
 
       Some investors have suggested that Tesla is a binary story  either worth nothing, or a lot. We believe that 
         the downside risk is not zero, particularly given the companys IP portfolio     2 and its property, plant and 
         equipment  3.  
 
The following sections will address key takeaways from the Tesla factory tour, key takeaways from Teslas retail 
store design concept and our assessment of end-market demand. 

                                                           
2 Tesla has 35 patents awarded and 280 applications pending. 
3 Using nearby land sales for comparison from commercial real estate broker CB Richard Ellis, we estimate the Fremont factory land is worth $91MM. Of 
course, this does not take into account the buildings on the site nor any of the equipment. Tesla paid $42MM for the plant and $17MM for additional 
equipment and plant emissions credits from Toyota. Some equipment was free and other machines were purchased at deep discounts because it was cheaper for 
Toyota to sell them to Tesla, or give them for free, than demo and haul the machines away.

Tesla factory tour, takeaways: 
 
Plant progress: 
       We were impressed with the progre ss that Tesla has made on its Fremon t factory in the past 3.5 months             4. 
         For example, installation of the Shuler press is almost complete (see photos, next page). Tesla is on track for 
         automated manufacturing to begin in FY12. 
 
       Second, Tesla has clearly outlined detailed plans fo       r major and minor manufact  uring milestones. After 
         touring the stamping, plastic, paint and final assembly lines, it became clear to us that Tesla has built in 
         buffer time to hit its mid-2012 Mode l S launch. Throughout the Fremont  factory, Tesla has posted large 
         charts with deadlines. Near the entrance of any part of the plant, one can see a large timeline with a string 
         that hangs over the current date. For example, the pa int shop has several near-term milestones posted with 
         deadlines, such as a facility deep clean, by June 15. 
 
       We believe that Tesla could achieve at least 4,800 Model S   units sold in FY12, even  if its internal timeline 
         slips three months. Eventually, the plant will produce 80 Model S units per 8-hour shift, but we believe that 
         will not be achieved until 2013. 
 
Plant potential: 
       Tesla is only using 1/5 of its Frem ont facility. The plant is big  very  big  at 200 acres and 5MM square 
         feet. A white board in the conference room at the entrance to the plant shows that more than half of the 
         factory has its lights off and is being reserved for future use.  
 
       Tesla set the date for the Model S launch and unit targets  before it had acquired the factory. Previous factory 
         designs were much smaller, and were to be located in Downey, Calif. 
 
       Teslas Model S lines are set up with sufficient space between stations to allow for expansion to up to 
         40,000 vehicles per year. The Model S line can scale up to 40,000 just by adding more labor.  
 
Model S alpha builds: 
       We observed a dozen alpha builds in testing. Some cars were painted orange for crash testing  orange 
         shows up better on camera.  
     
       On the day of our tour, Bosch had shipped back one Model S that had been cold-weather traction tested at 
         Boschs Minnesota testing grounds. The Model S performed well on all fronts, according to Bosch. 
 
       A central part of our initial thesis on Tesla was that the Model S had the potential to be not only a good 
         electric vehicle, but an excellent car. We stick by that thesis after seeing the Model S alpha builds. Also, the 
         flat panel display is a compelling part of the vehicle. The Model S seats seven passengers and has a roomy 
         interior.  
 
Anecdotes: 
       Gilbert Passin, vice president of manufacturing and          alumnus of Renault and Toyota, jointed Tesla in 
         January 2010. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said to Passin upon his hiring: Make the best car youve ever made in 
         your life.  
     
       Other key quotes from Passin: 

                                                           
4 The first thing that Tesla VP of Manufacturing Gilbert Passin did after closing on the NUMMI plant in October was to compile a list of assets. That took two 
months. Also, Toyota was clearing out until Jan 1.

         --From a manufacturing perspective, Im very comfortable with delivery. 
         --We are milestone driven. We are very focused, like   an Army. We are very driven with deliverables and 
         dates. 
         --Yes its a big place. Yes we have a lot to do. Its happening. Are there going to be some bumps in the 
         road? Sure. Are there going to be some late nights? Yes. But its going to happen. 
         --I have hired people from Toyota, Lexus, BMW and Aston Martin. These are people who know this 
         stuff. 
 
       We spoke with the head of the plastics operations. He has worked at the factory for 22 years, and Tesla 
         hired him to continue operating the plastic manufacturing. When we were there, he was re-configuring and 
         testing machines that had produced bumpers. He was also preparing new ovens to be ready by this summer.

VP Manufacturing Gilbert Passin walks through the future site of the final assembly facility, which should look more 
complete in July. The final assembly robots are being debugged and trained in Detroit before shipping. Installation 
on the first robots is to begin within days.

The Shuler press is nearly complete. It is the largest in th e U.S. and is hydraulic, which has the necessary finesse to 
bend the aluminum without ripping it. Other presses, made by Komatsu, are mechanical and used for interior parts.

Some of the press lines at the Fremont factory. A ne       w press line costs $20MM to $25MM; Tesla paid less than 
$250,000. Different presses are used for different parts. Te  sla paid $42MM for the plant and $17MM for additional 
equipment and plant emissions credits from Toyota  these  machines were purchased at deep discounts because it 
was cheaper for Toyota to sell them to Tesla, or give them for free, than demo and haul the machines away.         
 
Retail store design:   
 
       The Tesla store is a welcome and overdue departure from the way that cars have been sold in the past. The 
         Santana Row store, which opens to the public Saturday, is visually appealing and draws people in, engages 
         people through a variety of interactive media and displays and creates a comfortable buying environment 
         that is unlike any other retail car buying experience weve seen. 
 
       The store is designed by George Blankenship, Teslas head of retail store design and a former Apple 
         executive who helped to pioneer Apples mall store concept.  
 
       Teslas store concept is expandable because it unbundles retail operations from maintenance. By the end of 
         2013, Tesla should have about 50 stores of 2,000 square feet to 4,000 square feet (which hold two to four 
         cars) in high-end retail locations, such as the one we saw in Santana Row in San Jose. Its maintenance 
         centers will be in geographically central, lower rent locations. Tesla is signing five-year leases on its stores, 
         which will allow the company to adapt its store strategy as it sells additional vehicle models.

George Blankenship describes Teslas store strategy. The stores include large touch screens to design ones own car, 
and platters to choose colors. Tesla will encourage browsing to generate desire and good will for the brand. For 
example, parents are encouraged to put their nine-month-old with sticky fingers in the $130,000 Roadster and take a 
picture, without judgment. "Just try to do that at a Porsche dealer," Blankenship said. Tesla will keep another car 
clean for the serious buyers.

beside a BCBG Max Azria.

Discussing demand: 
 
       We maintain our thesis that cons umer demand for Teslas vehicles  will support the companys long-term 
         ambitions. 
     
       Tesla calculated that its 2010 North American market share on the Roadster is 2% for 2-seat sports cars that 
         cost more than $75,000.    5 
 
       We believe that Teslas initial production targets on the Model S are likely below end-market demand for its 
         vehicles 6. Assuming 20,000 Model S units sold in the U.S.,   we estimate that Teslas share of the high-end 
         vehicle market would be 0.85% -- or less than 1%. We note that this represents lower captured market share 
         than Tesla has already been able to achieve on the Roadster in the performance vehicle market. We also 
         note that the 20,000 units sold in 2013 is likely to incl  ude international shipments, which would make the 
         market share target even lower, and thus, even easier to achieve.  
 
       We estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 plug-in electric vehicl es will be produced for the U.S. market for 2013, 
         based on sales and volume projections by the U.S. Department of Energy, Tesla, Fisker, Ford, GM and 
         Nissan, among others. Thus, we estimate that in order  for Tesla to achieve its sales goal of 20,000 Model S 
         units that year, it would need to capture less than 10% of the electric vehicle market in 2013. (See table, next 
         page.) 
 
       We believe that Teslas market share will increase over time as it introduces additional versions of EVs.  
 
       Weve also investigated recent media reports about            the Nissan Leaf running out of juice and stranding 
         customers. We believe that such incidents are fewer than the media hype would lead us to believe. However, 
         perception matters and we note that the state of charge of a Tesla vehicle starts out three times higher than 
         Leaf, which should help to alleviate range concerns. Weve been conditioned, as drivers, to push our gas-
         powered cars well-past empty. We know that an E on a gas gauge really means we have 20-miles to go. 
         To that end, both the Tesla and Nissan Leaf vehicles are built with reserve miles. Nissan derives its 
         distance to empty by software formula, which tak             es into account previous energy used and energy 
         remaining. The distance is constantly updated, accordin g to our contacts at Nissan. Tesla relies on a similar 
         formula, though Tesla has said that it has an advantage in its software and charge assessments. 
 
 

                                                           
5 While we do not have the data granular enough to verify Tesla's calculations, they are in line with what wed expect. Based on our higher level data, we 
estimate that the Roadster has captured 0. 04% to 0.07% of the combined high-end and premium vehicle markets in the U.S., which  includes BMW, Mercedes, 
Jaguar, Lexus, Ferrari and Porsche. Even more broadly, we estimate  that Roadster sales in 2010 represented 0.005% of total US l ight vehicle sales. Given these 
broader categories, Teslas estimate of 2% market share of premium vehicles makes sense.  
6 Our estimates assume 18MM vehicles sold in the US in 2013. Our estimates are based on our research, Department of Energy data, National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration Data, Motor Intelligence  data, Wards Auto data and data from Te sla, Nissan and GM. We also spoke with the Department of Energys 
Advanced Technologies Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program office, which did its own eight month analysis on end-market demand.

Investment Risks: 
 
Risks that could prevent Tesla (TSLA) shares from achieving our price target include: 
   Model S Progress Risks  We believe that not achieving the anticipated roadmap for the Model S platform 
    presents one of the largest risks to the stock. Supplier   issues could be a source of delay. Teslas Roadster, for 
    example, relies on 150 suppliers for 2,000 parts. In th        e past, supplier delays ha  ve stalled progress on the 
    Roadster. Tesla has indicated that it  is on track to make first delivery   of the Model S in 2012. However, our 
    model assumes delays. 
   Profitability Targets  Teslas future profitability depends upon achieving 43% net cost reduction from the 
    Roadster to the Model S. Failure to achieve cost reduct ion objectives would be detrimental to the company and 
    the stock. 
   CEO Leadership Dependence  We believe that Tesla has been able to secure a bevy of automotive engineering 
    and design talent. Much of that can be attributed to the leadership and vision of CEO Elon Musk. We dont 
    expect Musk, a serial entrepreneur,  to remain at the helm of the comp  any beyond 2014. Contractually, Musk 
    should stay on until the Model S has performed successfully.

   Withdrawal of Government Support  Widespread electric vehicle adoption is encouraged by government buyer 
    incentives, government emissions regulations and government grants that support technological advancement 
    and build out of the charging infrastructure. A delete       rious change to the subsid  ies or support surrounding 
    electric vehicles could create an ethanol-like failure of the concept. 
   Stock Dilution  Shareholders could see dilution should the company pursue a plan to raise additional capital in 
    the form of stock or convertible debt.  
   Failure of the Electric Vehicle Concept  Despite the hype , electric vehicles have not proven their success as a 
    concept. Range anxiety is a real obstacle faced by cons  umers. Advertised ranges ar e generally overstated. Like 
    internal combustion engines, ranges vary by usage          pattern, including speed, acceleration and cabin climate 
    control, and the temperature and climate of the operating   environment. This issue is much bigger for electric 
    vehicles than for internal combustion engines, given the existing limits to their ranges. Also, we note that 
    ethanol failed for a variety of reasons, but a key reas     on was poor consumer adoption at the pump  vehicle 
    range drops up to 20% when fueled by E85. (Tesla has floated the idea of swap pack batteries that can be rented 
    for longer trips. We think that this model is unlikely to take off.)
