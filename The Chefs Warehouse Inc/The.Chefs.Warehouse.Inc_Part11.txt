      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
         is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
         non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
         to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
         target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
         the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.
      8. The conviction list is published once a month whilst global equity markets are closed.
      9. Transaction fees are not included.
     10. All corporate actions are taken into account.
