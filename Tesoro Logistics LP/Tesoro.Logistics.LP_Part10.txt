Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Raising TLLP Valuation To $31-33 Per Unit On Accelerated Distr. Growth Outlook 
           
We are raising our valuation range to $31-33 from $26-              28 per unit to reflect a higher forecast five-year 
distribution compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of               14.1% versus our previous estimate of 10.0%. Our 
accelerated distribution growth outl ook is supported by TLLPs higher-t           han-anticipated growth capex budget 
for 2011-13 (i.e. $100MM versus our previous estimate of $68MM), which is also expected to generate a more-
attractive average return relative to our previous assumption (i.e. EBITDA multiple of 3.3x versus our previous 
estimate of 3.8x). For 2011-16, we are now forecasting  total growth capex of $299MM at an average return of 
4.3x EBITDA, up from our previous estimate of $143MM of expenditures at an average return of 4.7x EBITDA. 
 
We are also assuming TLLPs first dropdown (i.e. the Martinez crude oil marine terminal) will be a $75MM 
acquisition (or a 9.375x EBITDA multiple) to be comple  ted by Q2 2012 versus our previous assumption of a 
$100MM transaction consummated at a 10x EBITDA multip le in Q1 2012. We continue to forecast a $100MM 
dropdown in 2013 and $150MM of annual dropdowns at an EBITDA multiple of 10x in 2014-16.   
 
Our valuation range of $31-33 per unit is predicated   on a combination of a divi dend discount model (DDM) 
and price-to-DCF multiple.  Our DDM yields a valuation of $33 per unit, and assumes a long-term distribution 
growth rate of 1.25%, and a required rate of return of 9.0%. The low-end of our valuation range reflects a price-
to-DCF multiple of about 15x our 2012 DCF per unit es  timate of $2.10. Risks to the units trading below our 
range include slower-than-forecast rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.

TLLP currently yields 4.4% and trades at 2011E and 2012 E price-to-distributable cash flow multiples of 17.5x 
and 15.1x, respectively. This compares to small-cap pipe line MLP peer group medians  of 7.2%, 10.9x, and 9.6x 
respectively. On a price/DCF-to-growth (analogous to PEG) basis, TLLP is trading at an attractive ratio of 0.8x, 
in our view, versus the peer median of 2.1x.

Our Distribution Forecast Could Prove Conservative Based On TLLPs Target Coverage Ratio 
 
TLLP targets a distribution coverage ratio of 1.1x. Based  on our 2012 and 2013 coverage ratio forecasts of 1.3x, 
this suggests that annual distribution growth in 2012  and 2013 could exceed our estimates of 16% and 24%, 
respectively, if management opts to pa y out more cash flow, in line with its coverage target. We estimate that 
TLLP could increase its 2012 and 2013 distribution            per unit by 32% and 20%, respectively, assuming a 
distribution coverage ratio of 1.1x. Under this scenar  io, however, the projected five-year distribution CAGR 
remains 14%, as TLLPs higher near-term growth potentia l is essentially offset by lower growth rates for the 
later years. Hence, our DDM-based valuation of $33 per unit would be unchanged.

Notably, TSOs analyst/investor day presentation on December 5, 2011, contains a slide on the companys 
expectations for the equity value of TLLP to increase to $1.4B in 2013 from $0.7B at its IPO. Growth of $0.7B 
in value appears to be split about two-thirds to th        e LP units and one-third to   the GP, which implies an 
incremental GP equity value of approximately $235MM. As suming a cash flow multiple of 22x for the GP, this 
would imply approximately $11MM of distributions to th            e GP in 2013. This is in line with the estimated 
distributions to the GP based on a 2013 distribution per  unit of $2.21 assuming a distribution coverage ratio of 
1.1x (see Figure 3). Assuming a 2013 GP equity value of about $235MM, the 2013 LP equity value would 
approximate $1.165B, or $38.18 per LP unit ($1.165B/30.5MM units). Based on a 2013 distribution per unit of 
$2.21 (under the 1.1x coverage scenario) and a stock pr         ice of $38.18 for TLLP, this implies a yield of 5.8% 
versus the current yield of 4.4%.

$100MM Of Organic Investments Should Yield                            Attractive Returns And Significant Volume 
Growth 
 
TLLP plans to invest $100MM of growth capex throug                    h 2013 and expects the projects will generate an 
incremental $30MM of EBITDA, which implies an attrac  tive average multiple of 3.3x. The partnership has 
earmarked 60% of the expenditures to grow its Bakken bu siness (High Plains System), which should result in 
an increase of about 50Mbbls/d in   gathering volumes (i.e. total estima ted volumes to exceed 100MBbls/d 
versus 59.5Mbbls/d in Q3 2011) and an increase of ab              out 11Mbbls/d in trucking vo lumes (i.e. total estimated 
volumes of 35Mbbls/d versus 23.9Mbbls/d in Q3 2011)  by 2013. The remaining $40MM of growth capex are 
related to projects to expand TLLPs terminal capaciti es and services, which should increase volumes by more 
than 40Mbbls/d by year-end 2013.

Crude Oil Gathering (High Plains System) . TLLP has budgeted growth capex of $60MM tied to organic 
growth opportunities in the Bakken Shale, which is ex pected to generate $20-25MM of incremental EBITDA. 
TSO is undertaking an expansion of its Mandan Refi                   nery to increase the capacity to 68Mbbls/d from 
58Mbbls/d in H1 2012. As the primar  y source of supply to the refinery, TLLPs High Plains System should 
realize a 10Mbbls/d increase in gathering volumes when the expansion is placed in service. Additionally, TSO 
is constructing a unit train (loading and unloading facilities and dedicated rail cars) to deliver up to 30Mbbls/d 
of Bakken crude oil to its Anacortes refinery by the en             d of 2012. Management anticipates that this project 
should result in an increase of 30Mbbls/d in High Pl            ains volumes and the assets (when completed) would be 
added to TLLPs portfolio of dropdown candidates. TLLP also plans to invest capital to connect the High Plains 
System to alternative destinations, which should add 10Mbbls/d of throughput beginning in 2012. 
 
The partnership intends to expand its trucking fleet to help alleviate takeaway constraints in the Bakken. 
Management expects trucking volumes will increase to   35Mbbls/d from 23.9Mbbls/d in Q3 2011. Notably, 
TLLP has amended its trucking agreement with TSO, which provides for a longer term and higher fixed 
minimum volume commitments. The partnership is to ch                    arge a mileage-based trucking rate, ranging from 
$1.95-4.71 per barrel, and a dispatch fee of $0.50-0.55  per barrel instead of a per barrel-based trucking rate, 
which we estimate is $2.72 per barrel currently. The mileage-based rate is to be adjusted annually based on the 
rates of third-party trucking carriers  transporting crude oil in Montana and North Dakota (subject to certain 
stated restrictions).

Crude Oil Takeaway Constraints Are Creating Increased Gathering Opportunities 
 
Similar to TLLP, other MLPs have benefitted from higher lease gathering margin in areas where crude oil 
production is regionally constrained.  Demand for infrastructure to transp ort crude production to market has 
increased, particularly in the new emerging shale plays. This demand has increased the value of the 
crude/lease gathering services, allowing crude gatherers (such as Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. [PAA] and 
Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. [SXL ]) to increase margin for gathered barrels. The increase in demand for 
crude lease gathering services is also being driven, in part, by the spread between WTI and Brent (or LLS) 
crude prices, incentivizing producers to pay a premium to deliver their production barrels to market.  
 
MLPs have responded to the increase in takeaway de   mand by expanding crude ga thering infrastructure; for 
example, several MLPs have ordered additional crude gathering trucks. PAA intends to expand its fleet by 34%, 
adding 180 trucks in 2011 to a current fleet of 530 truc ks within its supply and logistics segment. SXL plans to 
expand its truck fleet to 200 by year-end from approximately 140. 
 
We anticipate logistical constraints in crude oil shale plays to persist over the next 12-18 months as regional 
production outpaces takeaway capacity. While lease gath ering margin could decline  as additional trucks are 
placed into service, we believe overall lease gathering cash flow should remain at elevated levels in 2012 as 
MLPs would essentially be swapping margin for higher volume. Given the recurring nature of this margin, we 
believe MLPs are likely to pay out the increase in lease gathering profits in the form of higher distributions. 
 
Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage. TLLP is investing $40MM of growth capex through 2013 to 
expand its terminal capacities and services. The in   vestments should generate  $5-10MM of incremental 
EBITDA and increase terminalling volumes by more than 40Mbbls/d by year-end 2013. The partnership plans 
to expand the capacity at the Los Angeles, Mandan, an d Stockton terminals and gr ow third-party volumes at 
Boise, Burley, Vancouver, and Stockton. The partnership  also plans to continue its infrastructure optimization 
efforts (e.g. Los Angeles) and has b een successfully in generating an in cremental 20Mbbls/d in volumes thus 
far in 2011.  
 
Details On First Dropdown--Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal 
         
TLLP plans to acquire the Martinez Crude Oil (Golden Ea gle) Marine Terminal located in Martinez, California, 
from its GP sponsor TSO. The terminal is located on the Sacramento River near the Golden Eagle Refinery (see 
description below) and has access to the San Francisco Ba y. Assets include a dock, five crude oil storage tanks 
with 425Mbbls of capacity, and related pipelines. Th   e facility supplies TSOs Golden Eagle refinery and 
Martinez Terminal with crude oil from marine vessels. The wharf capacity is 145Mbbls/d. The projected 
volume is 70Mbbls/d (48% utilization) and compares to average crude oil throughput of 49.8Mbbls/d in 2010. 
TLLP has secured a ten-year (with  two five-year renewals) fee-based ag reement with TSO with a minimum 
volume commitment on 90% of projected volumes. The transaction is expected to close in early 2012, and is to 
be funded through the partnerships revolving credit facility. 
 
Acquisition Should Be Highly Accretive To DCF 
         
Management projects annual EBITDA from the Martinez terminal asset to be $8MM and annual maintenance 
capex to approximate $0.5MM. Assuming  an acquisition cost of $75MM, this implies an EBITDA multiple of 
9.4x. Notably, we estimate a $75MM cost for the drop  down based on managements  guidance of $1.5MM of 
incremental annual DD&A expense and the implied average depreciable life of 50 years assumed for TLLPs 
identified growth projects (i.e. $1.5MM x 50 year  s=$75MM). Our previous model incorporated a $100MM 
dropdown in Q1 2012 at an EBITDA multiple of 10.0x. 
 
We estimate the acquisition could be about $0.17 accret  ive to DCF per unit predicated on the partnerships 
financing plans (i.e. 100% with its credit facility). Ou r accretion forecast assumes 2012 annualized EBITDA of 
$8MM, in line with guidance, 100% short-term financing, an average interest rate of 3.1% on TLLPs revolving 
credit facility, and maintenance cape x of $0.5MM (or 6.25% of EBITDA), in line with guidance. Notably, we 
estimate the accretion to DCF per unit decreases to about $0.08 assuming 50% equity/50% debt financing at a 
yield of 4.4% and long term interest rate of 7.5%.

Overview of TSOs Martinez Refinery 
                
TSOs Martinez, California, (Golden Eagle) refinery       is located approximately 30 miles northeast of San 
Francisco on 2,206 acres in Martinez, California. It is TSOs largest refinery and the second-largest refinery in 
northern California, with 166Mbbls/d of refining capacity. In 2010, the Martinez refinery processed an average 
of 124Mbbls/d of crude oil and other feedstock. It pr                                         oduces transportation fuels including CARB gasoline, 
CARB diesel fuel, conventional gasoline, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and petroleum coke. 
                
The Martinez refinery receives crude oil from numerous  proprietary and third-party assets. It receives foreign, 
Alaskan, and California crude oil through its two mari                                         ne terminals, which have access to the San Francisco 
Bay, and third-party pipelines. Martin ezs refined products are distribute d through TLLPs Stockton and soon 
to be acquired Martinez terminals, TSOs marine and refined products terminal, and third-party terminals. 
 
Balance Sheet/Liquidity Update 
                
The partnership had $118MM of liquidity (including cash) as of the end of Q3 2011. TLLPs 2012 total debt 
should approximate $177MM (i.e. $51MM outstanding at year-end 2011, $75MM for the Martinez terminal 
acquisition, and $51MM of 2012 orga  nic capex spending net of excess cash flow. We believe that TLLP will 
exercise the accordion feature of its credit facility to increase the size to $300MM. This would provide the 
partnership with the flexibility to undertake additional                                         acquisitions and organic growth initiatives without 
issuing long-term debt or equity next year. We forecast   that the partnership could end 2012 with a pro forma 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3x.

Raising 2012 And 2013 DCF Estimates 
 
We are raising our 2012 and 2013 DCF per unit estima                                 tes to $2.10 and $2.66, respectively, from $1.98 and 
$2.18. Our 2011 DCF per estimate of $1.81 is unchange d. Our 2013 EBITDA forecast of $101MM (excluding a 
$10MM benefit from our $100MM dropdown assumption in Q1 2013) is essentially in line with managements 
guidance of $100MM. We are also increasing our 2012                                 and 2013 distribution per unit estimates to $1.61 and 
$2.00, respectively, from $1.59 and $1.83.  
 
Our revised 2012 and 2013 DCF estimates reflect the net impact of the following adjustments/assumptions: 
 
      1)    Estimated annualized EBITDA contribution of $8  MM from the acquisition of  the Martinez marine 
             terminal assuming the transaction cost $75MM and closes by Q2 2012. This compares to our previous 
             $100MM dropdown assumption in Q1  2012 at an EBITDA multiple of 10x (annualized EBITDA of 
             $10MM). 
       
      2)   Forecasted 2011-13 growth capex   of approximately $150MM (inclu ding approximately $50MM of 
             assumed incremental spending above the $100MM of identified projects) and an average return of 
             3.8x EBITDA. This compares to estimated growth capex of $68MM and an average return of 3.8x 
             incorporated in our previous model. 
 
      3)   Lower estimated 2012 interest expense of $4.0MM (versus our previous estimate of $7.1MM) based 
             on a smaller estimated dropdown of $75MM financed                                       on TLLPs credit facility at an estimated 
             interest rate of 3.1%. This compares to our prev  ious estimate of a $100MM acquisition funded with 
             debt at an interest rate of 6.5%.
