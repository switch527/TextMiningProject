  came away from the investor meetings with the impression that management
  is focused on becoming a multi-billion dollar business. And we believe the
  business strategy and product strategy are well-aligned as The Active Network
  has mastered the art of event registration lifecycle management. Given the
  fact that The Active Network is the 800-lb gorilla in the space, in our view,
  we foresee strong pricing power and attractive cross selling opportunities in
  the future. We also believe having a technological advantage, along with a
  dominant brand, sets the stage for an enduring business model that will grow
  rapidly with high profit margins.

                                                                                                Company Update

Bears' theses partially misguided, in our view. We've heard two bear theses recently and believe one thesis is overblown.
First, some bears believe ACTV's IP is easy to replicate, indefensible and simply a payment processing engine. Our
customer due diligence sessions have revealed quite the opposite. Customers indicate high satisfaction levels, in general,
and especially with the workflow automation, ease of customization, and the back-end capabilities in addition to the payment
processing engine. So while consumers/investors tend to only see the front-end of the solution (payment processing
engine), the customers we spoke with tend to rave about the solution capabilities to manage their overall business not
just the payments engine. We also think the level of annual R&D spend should allow ACTV to maintain a compelling
technological advantage over the competition, in our view. Second and the other bear thesis is around technology-acquisition
integration risk, which we view as a legitimate risk. As further discussed below, we expect The Active Network to be an
aggressive consolidator of the space. And while acquisition waves create advantages in terms of pricing power and cross-
sell opportunities, it also poses operational risks and could make it difficult for investors to discern The Active Network's
underlying organic growth rate. We think as more customers migrate to the ActiveWorks platform (and the legacy product
R&D spend diminishes) investors will see the margins accrete more meaningfully, which likely will dispel the bears thesis,
though this could take a couple quarters or more to play out.
Believe aggressive M&A strategy makes sense for an 800 lb gorilla. We view The Active Network as the undisputed
leader in the registrations lifecycle management industry with 5x the scale of the nearest competitor and an annual R&D
spend (~$80M in 2012) that is likely greater than most competitors' annual revenue. Our research indicates that The Active
Network is automatically called in to the vast majority of deals and enjoys an unusual level of pricing power for its products.
We therefore believe it is unlikely a small competitor or a new entrant can overcome ACTV's dominant market share, pricing
power and large technological advantage. However, the registrations lifecycle management market is very large, highly
fragmented and despite ACTV's size, the business is less than 10% penetrated in the market today and is less than 5%
penetrated within the Enterprise customer base, in our view. Therefore, given the scale of the Active Network's infrastructure
and existing service-oriented architecture, it makes sense for The Active Network to be "the big consolidator" in the space
and enlarge its market share through an acquisition strategy, in our opinion. The Active Network typically acquires companies
to enter new markets or add new products and/or capabilities to the suite.
Believe Starcite acquisition is visionary, expect the market to follow in 12-24 months. The Active Network is the only
vendor we are aware of that offers an integrated attendee management and spend management solution in the market
today. We think The Active Network is showing significant market vision with the Starcite acquisition and likely has a 12-24
month first-mover advantage before the competition follows. ACTV's strategy for the Meetings Management market could
turn out analogous with Concur's vision to integrate expense management with travel management in 2006, in our view.
We remember the nay sayers at first did not believe travel and expense management capabilities needed to be integrated
and should be stand-alone, but this viewpoint was dispelled by customer purchasing habits, which forced the competition to
follow Concur's market strategy. We think it is a logical direction for the Meetings Management market to combine attendee
management solutions with spend management solutions in an integrated platform. By combining these technologies,
businesses will have greater visibility in forecasting ROI for their events. We also note that the larger ERPs like Oracle
already use The Active Network for their OpenWorld conferences in the US and China, which we think indicates the high-
value of the technology.
Latest platform architecture could lead to larger deals & faster innovation. Most of the largest SaaS companies
we  follow  CRM,  CNQR,  ULTI,  RNOW  have  previously  upgraded  their  platforms  to  the  latest  technologies,  similar  to
Active Network's development of the ActiveWorks platform. ActiveWorks' service-oriented architecture allows for easy
customizations and includes embedded capabilities that make larger events a more attractive ROI for the business, in
our opinion. Additionally, we expect The Active Network to leverage existing IP, along with new innovations and acquired
technologies like Starcite, to succeed in altering its own architecture to accelerate new product introductions like Schwaggle,
over the next couple of years.
Increased confidence in a potential multibillion dollar trajectory. We came away from the investor meetings with the
impression management has its sights set on becoming a multibillion business. And we believe the business strategy
and  product  strategy  are  aligned  to  achieve  this  long-term  goal  since  The  Active  Network  has  mastered  the  art  of
event registration lifecycle management. Because The Active Network has harnessed more than 10 years of technology
development, it enjoys a lower long-term cost structure and faster rate of evolution of its technology, relative to other event
registration lifecycle management vendors, in our opinion. And given the fact that we think The Active Network is the 800-
lb gorilla in the space, we foresee strong pricing power and attractive cross selling opportunities in the future. We believe
this technological advantage, along with a dominant brand, sets the stage for an enduring business model that will grow
rapidly with high profit margins.

  Margin expansion thesis appears on track. Part of the ACTV bull thesis revolves around on-going margin expansion in
  the model. For the past two years EBITDA margins have grown ~200-300 bps annum and guidance assumes a similar
  300bps expansion, excluding acquisitions. Margins are likely to stay flat in 1H:2012 (vs. 2H: 2011) owing to higher integration
  costs and lower revenue recognized upfront from Starcite, but likely to accrete more meaningfully in 2H:2012 and 2013 from
  salesforce efficiency gains, lower R&D spend, and higher bookings, in our view.

  Multiple expansion potential. Since the Street is not currently valuing the business on Price/Sales, despite a highly,
  recurring revenue stream and SaaS industry leading retention rates, we believe consistent execution and further ActiveWorks
  adoption could expand the company's trading multiple. In contrast to older products, ActiveWorks is not a stand-alone point-
  product but a platform that could be used by other divisions within a business. Thus, the organic growth potential with existing
  customers is more attractive with ActiveWorks than the legacy solutions. One hurdle for revenue growth is migrating the
  customer to the new platform, which typically involves a more consultative engagement.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 19x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our $19 price target for ACTV shares is based on the same EV/EBITDA
multiple (i.e., 19x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $60M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the out year and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is below our 20% long-
term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 2.1x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50% discount to the current
SaaS companies' group average of 4.2x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is also based on 2.2x our EV/2013E
revenue estimate of $485M, as we use a similar valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV shares should continue to
trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue mix and lower gross margins
than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.
