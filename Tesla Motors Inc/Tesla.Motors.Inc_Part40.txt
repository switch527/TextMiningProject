                     think 20,000 units are achievable in 2014.  This would 
                     represent one-tenth the volume of best-in-class luxury 
                     sedan nameplates, or 1% of the luxury sedan market.   

                     3.  OEM partnerships:  Tesla has partnerships with 
                     Daimler and Toyota, but volumes are small.  New or 
                     expanded partnerships would be a catalyst for the stock.   

                     Tesla could be the future of the auto industry; we see 
                     7 factors that, together, could drive TSLA over $100:  
                     (1) OEM contracts, (2) subsidies for electric vehicles 
                     and EV infrastructure, (3) fleet sales, (4) leasing, 
                     (5) faster model extensions, (6) battery technology 
                     breakthroughs, and (7) much higher oil prices.   

                     However, catalysts are few and uncertain.  Additional                  Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                     or expanded OEM partnerships are most likely to drive                  companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As 
                                                                                            a result, investors should be aware that the firm may 
                     the stock higher, but we have no expectations on timing.  
                                                                                            have a conflict of interest that could affect the 
                     Model S launch is still two years away.  We think                      objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors

Summary and Overview          4 
 Tesla Motors is an integrated auto company with its own distribution network.  It designs, engineers, manufactures, 
 and sells high-performance electric vehicles (EVs) under its own brand.   
 •     High margins would drive stock upside.  Tesla targets a long-term 1315% EBIT margin, an aggressive goal.  
     We assume industry-average EBIT margins of 58%, but see significant potential upside, even exceeding 
     managements targets. 
 •     High volumes could also drive upside.  Even relatively expensive cars sell well above Teslas volume forecast.   
 •     OEM partnerships could drive volumes and value.   
 •     Competitive dynamics heighten uncertainty.  Tesla sells the only highway-capable EV, but that is about to 
     change.   
 •      Balance sheet is strong enough to absorb modest delays to managements plan.  Tesla raised $235 million in the 
     IPO and still has over $400 million available to draw on its loan from the Department of Energy.   
 •     The stock looks fairly valued today. 
Investment Debates Summary          6 
Debate 1:  What Will Teslas Margins Be?                                                                                7 
 The market expects Tesla to hit its long-term 1315% EBIT margin target due to proprietary technology, efficient 
 manufacturing, and ownership of distribution.  Our conservative margin forecast of 58% is in line with large 
 automakers and reflects limited visibility.  However, we see several factors that could give Tesla an advantage over 
 competitors such as zero-emission vehicle credit sales, low advertising spend, and low capex.  If Tesla hits its target 
 margins, our valuation based on DCF would increase by 150%, to $28, in line with our EV/sales value of $27.   
 •     What to look for to see how margins will evolve:  indications of volumes, especially Model S pre-orders; 
     manufacturing delays or cost overruns; faster reductions in battery prices. 
Debate 2:  Volumes: Is 20,000 Model S Units Per Year Doable?                                                 11 
 The market credits 20,000 Model S units per year.  We think the potential volume range is wide, but that 20,000 units 
 by 2014 is a reasonable estimate:  20,000 units = 0.70% of 2014e global luxury sedan sales; best-in-class luxury 
 models all sell more than 200,000 units/year; Tesla has over 2,800 Model S reservations; and the Model S prototype 
 and specs are impressive. 
 •     Competition in alternative fuel vehicles is increasing.  
 •     What influences adoption of electric vehicles, and how will the Model S compete? 
Debate 3:  Will Other OEMs Partner with Tesla?                                                         15 
 Large partnerships are not priced into the stock.  We think new OEM partnerships are likely, and that larger volumes 
 would drive value.  Tesla has partnerships with Daimler and with Toyota to supply battery packs.  Volumes are small 
 (less than 7% of revenues by 2013), but the opportunity could be large.  
 •     We think Tesla offers 3 things that others dont.  
 •     What are Daimler and Toyota getting?  
 •     How much is it worth to Teslas valuation? 
Seven Factors In Combination Could Drive the Stock to $100                                             17

Debate 2:  Volumes: Is 20,000 Model S Units Per Year Doable?

 have confidence, but heres what we know:                                2% of the market; cars over $70,000, less than 1%.  After the

What Influences Adoption of Electric Vehicles, and How Will the Model S Compete?  

We expect customers will purchase alternative fuel vehicles          Government incentives in the US are attractive.  In addition 
including pure electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids          to the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US, there are some

government incentives, and performance.                             provides a sales tax exemption for alternative fuel vehicles.

gasoline and an electric system, increasing the cost and 
complexity.  By focusing on a pure EV, Tesla hopes to have 
excellent performance at a price that is competitive with 
traditional autos.  Excluding an internal combustion engine and 
all of the related emissions control systems increases cargo 
capacity (the Model S offers front and rear storage) and lowers 
cost.

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of July 31, 2010) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
