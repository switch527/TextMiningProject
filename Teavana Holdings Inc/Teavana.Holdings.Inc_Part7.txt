 Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates

 correspond with "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent
 recommended relative weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See

  Rating Definitions
     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At times
     analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock performance
     is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at www.piperjaffray.com/
     researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there is no active analyst opinion
     or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should not be relied upon as individual
     investment advice. As always, an investor’s decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual circumstances, including existing holdings,
     time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other
     information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions than those expressed by the research
     analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies and may contradict the opinions contained
     in fundamental research reports.
     •  Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
     •  Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
     •  Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst’s view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst’s coverage group. A Favorable industry
     outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment time horizon.
     A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to either improve
     or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals
     and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
