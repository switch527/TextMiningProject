                            contract negotiations with Sprint have   intensified ahead of the December 31                            May-10

                            accounts for 55% of total        revenue. This puts TNAV's medium-term growth                         
                            prospects seriously at risk and could lead other customers to pressure pricing.  

                         •  Sprints BATNA:  Free Navigation. On discussing the issue with TNAV 
                            management, we believe Sprint is seeking an aggressive reduction in pricing, 
                            possibly citing ad-based 'free' navigation as the best alternative to a negotiated 
                            agreement (BATNA). We believe TNAV is  countering with proposals for price 
                            reductions and new applications; however we sense that Sprint has the upper 
                            hand. Critically, this is not a replay of  the last contract ro llover, where bundled 
                            pricing sparked a net revenue gain for TNAV owing to price-elastic demand; 
                            this time Sprint seeks a net reduction in cost of supply, we believe.

                                     •  We are cutting estimates.  We are introducing a 37% reduction in ARPU to $0.64 
                                       by mid CY11, which assumes price declines  of near 50% at Sprint, flat at AT&T, 
                                       T-Mobile, and other carriers. We also assume subscriber growth is 10% lower than 
                                       our prior forecast on the assumption that Sprint pushes a higher proportion of 
                                       customers into ad-based services. We ar  e reducing gross margins by ~190bp in 
                                       FY11 and by 280bp in FY12. We assume th at company reins in operating expenses 
                                       relative to prior expectations but continues to ramp R&D investment. Where 
                                       previously we forecast a 22% CY10-1  2 revenue CAGR, we now forecast 5%. 
                                       CY11E EBITDA goes to $43.2mm (previously $78.8mm), and CY12 goes to 
                                       $71.2mm (previously $97.4mm). Until we know the outcome of the Sprint 
                                       negotiations, we sense there is downside risk to these estimates.  
                                     •  We believe contract negotiations with  Sprint will conclude by December 31, 
                                       2010.  
                                     •  We are downgrading TNAV to Neutral,   meaning that we expect the stock to 
                                       perform in line with the mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.

                                    Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                    We are downgrading TNAV to Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to 
                                    perform in line with the mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months. 
                                    Long-term growth prospects associated with navigation and LBS solutions are now 
                                    offset by the risks of pricing pressure at key customers, spurred by the availability of 
                                    'free' solutions from Nokia and Google. 

                                    We are establishing a December 2011 price target of $7.00 with this note (prior 
                                    price target $13.50, December 2010). The price target is based on an assigned 
                                    multiple of 6 times revised CY11E PF EBITDA of $71.2 million; the multiple is 
                                    based on the comms software/services peer group multiple. The market cap takes 
                                    into consideration $112mm and zero debt. We use 45.5 million shares to calculate 
                                    our per share price target. 

                                    Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                    We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                    following reasons: 

                                    •  Negotiations with Sprint conclude with more favorable pricing terms than we 
                                        have assumed. 
                                    •  TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate. 
                                    •  Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth. 
                                    •  New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs and 
                                        gross margins. 
                                    •  Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based navigation/mcommerce, 
                                        Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of expectations. 
                                    •  "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the market 
                                        or reduce their commitment. 
                                    •  TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                        growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                    We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                    reasons: 

                                    •  Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or negotiates terms that reduce 
                                        revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations. 
                                    •  AT&T, T-Mobile, or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                        TNAV, or  reduce pricing. 
                                    •  Free navigation from Google, Nokia, and Mircosoft captures market share owing 
                                        to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                    •  TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated. 

                                                                                                                     3

                                        •  Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 

                                        •  International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 

                                        •  The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, leading to 
                                           lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
