KEY INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

We have initiated coverage on Chefs’ Warehouse with a Buy (1) rating and a price target of 
$20.  We view the specialty foodservice distributor as a best-of-breed operator that is well 
positioned to continue to gain market share.  Thus, we have forecasted strong growth in sales 
and earnings for the near and long term.  With a moderately undervalued equity valuation, 
CHEF’s stock presents a timely investment, in our opinion. 
 
Chefs’ boasts industry-leading comparative metrics.   Chefs’ financial and operating 
metrics  compare  favorably  to  those  of  Sysco   (SYY–$27.16–Hold)  and  United  Natural 
Foods  (UNFI–$38.27–Buy).  We have segmented our comparative analytics into three areas 
containing 14 specific measures. In sales and profitability Chefs’ ranked #1, and in operational 
metrics the company ranked #2. CHEF’s LTM sales grew 21% compared to 7.7% for SYY and 
20.3% for UNFI, driven by an 18.1% internal sales growth rate versus 7% for SYY and 13.1% 
for  UNFI.    Even  more  impressive  in  our  view,  Chefs’  ranked  #1  in  four  of  five  selected 
profitability metrics: gross margin, profit margin, ROIC, and GMROI. In terms of operating 
metrics, Chefs’ ranked behind Sysco but above United Natural.  Chefs’ 99% fill rate is in line 
with Sysco and above United Natural’s 97%.  We would argue that Chefs’ boasts the best 
comparative metrics of the three, a rare (but not unprecedented) feat for such a relatively 
small company. 
 
Chefs’ competes in the faster-growing specialty niche of foodservice distribution.   
We  estimate  the  high-end  specialty  foodservice  distribution  addressable  market  at  $22B 
versus  $191B  for  the  entire  foodservice  distribution  industry.    We  forecast  the  long-term 
annual growth rate for specialty foodservice distribution at 5%–6% versus 3%–4% for the 
broad industry.  This market is highly fragmented, and we project Chefs’ target market for 
acquisition at 1,000 firms totaling $18B in annual sales.  
 
Chefs’ is positioned to continue to gain market share.   During the past four years, 
CHEF’s annual top-line growth has averaged 10%.  Our industry analysis places Chefs’ in a 
superior  position  that  reflects  moderately  lower  pricing  levels  versus  smaller  specialty 
distributors, combined with better service and/or assortment levels.  This should continue to 
allow Chefs’ to gain market share in specialty distribution going forward.   
 
We view Chefs’    culture of excellence as its key competitive advantage  based on our 
extensive  channel  checks  with  customers  and  suppliers.    This  emanates  from  a  strong 
management team that combines lengthy experience and a passion for the business.  Other 
key points of competitive differentiation include Chefs’ best-in-class sales team, the majority 
of  whose  members  have  formal  culinary  training,  degrees  in  the  culinary  arts,  or  prior 
experience working in the industry.  Lastly, the average specialty distributor carries about 
1,600 SKUs, which is dwarfed by the 11,500 SKUs that Chefs’ can bring to the table. 
 
Chefs’ has two major avenues of growth—organic and via acquisition.   First, based 
on a sales productivity gap analysis, we project incremental earnings power at Chefs’ less 
productive non-New York facilities at $0.55/sh.  Second, we anticipate that Chefs’ should be 
able to complete on average two acquisitions per year, up from an historical rate of about one 
per   annum.   We   estimate   that   an   increase   in   acquisition   activity   could   contribute   an 
incremental  6%  to  annual  sales  growth  versus  the  3%  historical  average  in  recent  years. 
Because of management’s track record of successfully integrating previous acquisitions, we 
anticipate that EPS contribution would be meaningfully accretive.   
 
We  forecast  strong  top-  and  bottom-line  growth.   For  53-week  2011,  we  forecast 
growth in sales of 19.2% to $393.7M, in operating profit of 42% to $28.7M, and in pro forma 
EPS of 41% to $0.79.  For 2012, we forecast growth in sales at 10% to $433M, in operating 
profit of 20.6% to $34.6M, and in EPS of 23% to $0.97. For 2013, we forecast growth in sales 
of 10.5% to $478.4M, and in EPS of 19% to $1.15. We project free cash flow/sh at $0.55 for 
2012 and $1.00 for 2013.  
 
We view Chefs’ equity as moderately undervalued.   CHEF’s forward P/E ratio based 
on estimated calendar 2012 EPS is 14.0x versus 17.0x for the peer group, or a 18% discount; 
its EV/EBITDA based on forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA is 8.9x versus the group at 9.1x, or 
a 2% discount; its EV/sales based on projected calendar 2012 sales is 0.75x versus the group 
at 0.82x, or a 9% discount. While its valuation metrics are at a moderate discount to its peers, 
we   forecast   that   Chefs’   intermediate-term   fundamentals   will   outperform.      Thus,   we 
recommend aggressive accumulation of its shares at current levels. 

                                                                                      2 of 31

                                                  Below we first analyze Chefs’ comparative operating and financial metrics versus two other 
                                                  leading food distributors, Sysco and United Natural Foods.  Chefs’ ranks at or above the other 
                                                  two distributors in the majority of the metrics we measured.  Second, we present results of our 
                                                  proprietary channel checks with Chefs’ customers and suppliers.  Based on these checks, we 
                                                  conclude that qualitatively as well, Chefs’ ranks as a best-of-breed food distributor.

United Natural, Chefs’                            of  Sysco  and  United  Natural.    We  segmented  our  comparative  analytics  into  three  areas 
                                                  containing  14  specific  measures.    In  sales  and  profitability  Chefs’  ranked  first,  and  in 
ranked #1 in sales and                            operational metrics the company ranked second.  We would argue that Chefs’ boasts the best 
profitability and #2 in                           comparative metrics of the three, a rare (but not unprecedented) feat for such a relatively

                                                  Based on LTM results, CHEF’s total sales grew 21% compared to 7.7% for SYY and 20.3% for 
                                                  UNFI, driven by an 18.1% internal sales growth rate (versus 7% for SYY and 13.1% for UNFI).  
                                                  Even more impressive in our view, Chefs’ ranked first in four of five selected profitability 
                                                  metrics; gross margin, profit margin, ROIC and GMROI. CHEF’s LTM gross margin of 26.2% 
                                                  exceeded  18.6%  for  Sysco  and  18.2%  for  United  Natural,  and  despite  a  19.6%  operating 
                                                  expense ratio (the highest of the three distributors), it generated a 6.6% profit margin versus 
                                                  5% for SYY and 2.9% for UNFI.   CHEF’s ROIC of 33% was above 31.6% for SYY and 17% for 
                                                  UNFI as was GMROI at 4.2x versus 3.8x for SYY and 1.8x for UNFI. 
                                                   
                                                  For most operating metrics Chefs’ ranked behind Sysco but above United Natural.  Chefs’ 99% 
                                                  fill rate is in line with Sysco and above United Natural’s 97%.  CHEF’s LTM sales and gross 
                                                  profit per square foot of $966 and $253, respectively, compared to $1,628 and $303 for SYY 
                                                  and $574 and $104 for UNFI.  Also, Chefs’ achieved LTM revenue per sales associate of $2.9M 
                                                  (versus $4.9M for SYY) and gross profit per sales associate of $753K (versus $915K for SYY).

                                        Chefs’ Competes in Fast-Growth Niche of Foodservice Distribution 

                                        Chefs’ Warehouse competes within the $191B domestic foodservice distribution market.  But 
                                        given its high-end specialty focus, its addressable market is far smaller, which we estimate at 
                                        $22B.  We view the specialty foodservice distribution market as faster growing at an estimated 
                                        secular annual growth rate of 5%–6% versus 3%–4% for all of foodservice distribution. Below 
                                        we present detailed analysis supporting and amplifying these conclusions.  

                                        Addressable Market Size and Growth of Specialty Foodservice Distribution Market 

We estimate the                         We  estimate  the  Chefs’  Warehouse’s  addressable  market  at  $22B.   Foodservice 
                                        distribution  sales  are  derived  from  demand  from  its  customers.    The  largest  customer 
addressable market for high-
                                        segment is the restaurant industry, which makes up 58% of foodservice distribution industry 
end specialty foodservice               volume (see left-hand chart of  Figure 3). The right-hand chart in  Figure 3 shows that of the 
distribution at $22B                    $110B   in   distribution   sales   to   restaurants,   44%   or  $48.4B   is   sold   into   independent 
                                        restaurants, which as a class represent the primary market for  Chefs’ Warehouse.  Chefs’ 
                                        further distinguishes its target as independent restaurants that offer an average entree price 
                                        of $15 or greater.  We believe this sub-group represents roughly one-third, or about $16B in 
                                        purchased goods from foodservice distributors.  To this we add $6B in estimated potential 
                                        sales to natural/gourmet retailers such as  Whole Foods  (WFM–$63.11–Hold), as well as to 
                                        certain caterers, country clubs and other users of high-end foodservice-oriented groceries.

                                        We forecast foodservice establishments’ annual secular growth rate at 3%–4%.   
                                        Since foodservice/restaurants are the largest customer group for distributors, we believe they 
                                        serve  as  the  best  proxy  for  their  derived  demand.    As  shown  in  Figure  4,  year-to-date 
                                        nominal sales growth for foodservice places has risen 5.1% while real growth is up 3%.  This is 
                                        a solid cyclical recovery from the last five-year average growth of 2.9% nominal and 0% real 
                                        and is closer to the prior ten-year period from 1997–2006 (see “Arithmetic Mean” at bottom 
                                        of  Figure 4). We project that secular annual foodservice sector growth is likely to settle at 
                                        3%–4%   nominal   and   0.5%–1%   real;   our   view   is   consistent   with   that   of   industry

annual growth rate for high-            informed by recent survey work by leading market researcher The NPD Group. In May, NPD 
end specialty foodservice               released “The Changing Consumer Mindset: What it Means to the Restaurant Industry.” In 

distribution at 5%–6%                   essence,  NPD’s  surveys  revealed  that  76%  of  consumers  were  “cautious”  and  likely  to  be 
                                        “controlled  spenders”  going  forward  while  24%  were  “optimistic”  and  were  not  likely  to 
versus 3%–4% for the broad              change   their   restaurant   dining   habits.   The   only   common   demographics   among   the 
industry                                “optimistic”  group  were  the  likelihood  of  being  employed  and  affluent—i.e.,  the  target 
                                        customers of high-end restaurants and food retailers.  We think these survey results explain 
                                        the   meaningful   differential   in   growth   trends   among  high-end   and   mid-   and   low-end 
                                        restaurant and food retail concepts.

                                        Supply Side of Specialty Foodservice Distribution is Very Fragmented 

                                        The U.S. foodservice distribution industry contains some 16,500 firms that generated $191B 
                                        in revenues in 2009.   Figure 5 presents the market segmentation by type of distributor.  The 
                                        three largest companies (Sysco, US Foodservice, and Performance Food Group) account for 
                                        32% of the sales of the market.  Of the remaining 68% of the markets, some $36B, or 19% of 
                                        the  total,  is  transacted  by  smaller  specialty  foodservice  distributors;  this  segment  best 
                                        represents Chefs’ market niche.

We project Chefs’ target                We project Chefs’ target market for acquisition at 1,000 firms totaling $18B in 
                                        annual sales.  We believe that the 2,000 specialty distributors in the United States with 
market for acquisition at 
                                        sales between $10M and $70M are the most suitable acquisition targets for Chefs’. These 
about 1,000 firms totaling              2,000 distributors’ total sales are $36B, putting the average firm’s annual revenue at about 
$18B in annual sales                    $18M.  We assume that one-half cater to the high end of the market sufficiently to make them 
                                        potential  acquisition  candidates  for  Chefs’.  We  estimate  this  equates  to  $18B  in  possible 
                                        acquisition targets for Chefs’ over time; we note this supply-side figure is consistent with our 
                                        estimate of $22B for the total high-end specialty addressable market, which should be the 
                                        case in such a fragmented industry niche.

                                        Chefs’ is Positioned to Continue to Take Share in Specialty Foodservice Distribution 

                                        Industry  structural  analysis  places  Chefs’  in  a  superior  position.     Competition 
                                        within the foodservice distribution industry is mainly based on the quality of the services and 
                                        variety  of  products  offered  versus  the  price  asked  for  those.  Operational  issues  such  as 
                                        reliability and timeliness of deliveries also are highly relevant. We reflect these key attributes 
                                        via a two-dimensional competitive map (see  Figure 6). The vertical axis represents quality of 
                                        service and variety of products, while the horizontal axis represents price.  
                                         
                                        Large broadline distributors such as Sysco, US Foodservice, and Performance Food Group 
                                        traditionally have focused on providing good customer service and product variety at a market 
                                        price and therefore are depicted at the center of the two-dimensional competitive positioning 
                                        map. Chain dedicated distributors such as Martin-Brower (exclusive to McDonald’s) are far 
                                        more price focused, offering fewer services—they are very close to drayage providers and are 
                                        depicted at the lower left quadrant, which represents low service and low price.

                                        Intra-sector Competitive Analysis Favors Chefs’ 

                                        Below, we analyze the key attributes that have fostered this competitive advantage and also 
                                        discuss why large broadline distributors do not pose too great of a competitive threat.  
                                         
Chefs’ offers more than                  Greater product variety.   In most instances, Chefs’ is competing with smaller firms that 
                                        offer many of the 300–400 top-selling SKUs but lack the assortment that allows Chefs’ to 
11,500 products versus 
                                        position itself as both a deeper specialist and a broadliner of necessary commodity goods such 
some 1,600 for a typical                as dairy and flour.  According to market research firm Mintel Group, the average specialty 
specialty distributor                   distributor offers 1,609 products, which is dwarfed by the 11,500 SKUs that Chefs’ can bring 
                                        to the table.  In general, smaller firms are higher priced, but positioned as narrow specialists. 
                                        Thus, in  Figure 6  they are in an inferior position to the right and below Chefs’.  (See pages

                                        Competition from Broadliners is Relatively Benign 

                                        Large broadline distributors also present potential competition for Chefs’.  But as indicated by 
                                        our channel checks, large broadliners appear to lack the deep knowledge and/or sourcing

                                        capabilities   to   adequately   serve   many   of   the   culinary   needs   of   high-end   foodservice 
                                        establishments.  In regards to in-stock selection, large broadliners seem to be limited to those 
                                        specialty SKUs that can sell to their largely family restaurant independent customers. 
                                         
                                        By way of example, Sysco  goes to market in high-end specialty products arena largely through 
                                        its Internet “Chef Ex” portal that allows for direct ordering from vendors without a marketing 
                                        associate’s involvement.  We estimate that Chef Ex carries goods from some 150–160 distinct 
                                        vendors versus more than 1,000 suppliers at Chefs’ Warehouse.  Similar to smaller specialty 
                                        distributors, Sysco’s offering appears limited to the most demanded items.  For example, we 
                                        note that both Sysco’s Chef Ex and Chefs’ Express carry Barry Callebaut’s chocolate and cocoa 
                                        (one of the leading chocolate producers globally).  However, Chef Ex does not carry goods 
                                        from  many  of  the  smaller  artisanal  fine  chocolate  makers  from  which  Chefs’  Warehouse 
                                        sources products. 

                                        Chefs’ Warehouse’s Robust Growth Outlook 

Based on a sales                        Based on its strong competitive position, Chefs’ has two major avenues of growth—organic 
                                        and via acquisition.  Below, we first analyze the strong organic growth potential in optimizing 
productivity gap analysis, we 
                                        capacity of its current infrastructure. Based on a sales productivity gap analysis, we project 
project incremental earnings            incremental earnings power at its non-New York facilities (41% of current sales) at $0.55/sh.  
power at its non -New York               
facilities at $0.55/sh                  Second, we analyze the outlook for acquisition-driven growth, which we anticipate will be a 
                                        significant and highly accretive feature of the Chefs’ story over time.  While we do not build 
                                        unannounced acquisitions into our financial projections, we anticipate that Chefs’ should be 
                                        able to complete on average two acquisitions per year, up from an historical rate of about one 
                                        per   annum.   We   estimate   that   an   increase   in   acquisition   activity   could   contribute   an 
                                        incremental  6%  to  annual  sales  growth  versus  the  3%  historical  average  in  recent  years. 
                                        Because of management’s track record of successfully integrating previous acquisitions, we 
                                        anticipate that the EPS contribution would be accretive.  As we analyze below, the amount of 
                                        accretion would vary greatly depending on whether the deal was a fill-in or new market entry.  

                                        Maximizing Profits of Current Distribution Infrastructure 
                                        In our view, Chefs’ major opportunity to maximize earnings of its distribution infrastructure 
                                        is by growing market share in non-New York regions, which are far less productive than its 
                                        New York assets.  We believe this is understandable given the company has operated in New 
                                        York for 26 years and in the other markets from 7–12 years.   Figure 7 shows that 59% of the 
                                        company’s revenue was generated in the greater New York market and the remaining 41% at 
                                        six other regions from five facilities.  (New England is currently served from the Bronx, while 
                                        the other five markets have dedicated distribution centers.)

Growing share by penetration of existing customers. By virtue of its far longer market 
presence in New York, Chefs’ boasts far greater share of wallet with customers there. Thus, in 
newer markets, Chefs’ has the opportunity to add SKUs that are already successful in New 
York to gain penetration. For example, Chefs’ offers its New York customers some 160 SKUs 
of frozen seafood, while in Los Angeles it carries 15 at present. Our channel checks confirm 
that this process of gaining penetration with existing customers is ongoing, even in its more 
penetrated New York/New Jersey market that continues to gain share of wallet. 
 
Growing share with new customer wins.  Chefs’ gains access to new customers based on 
its  industry  knowledge  and  experience  and  relationships  with  leading  culinary  thought 
leaders.  We believe the company’s reputation as the leading distributor of  specialty food 
products in key culinary markets is a strong calling card.  The markets Chefs’ serves and many 
of the chefs with which it collaborates set culinary trends for the rest of the United States.  
This provides valuable insights into changing culinary and menu practices that over time have 
resulted in new customer wins. 
 
Robust   gross   margins   allow   for   strong   operating   leverage   with   increased 
product offerings.   Chefs’ has boosted its product offerings to 11,500 currently from 6,000 
in 2007.  Further some 2,000 to 3,000 new SKUs come in and go out of its system each year 
as demand and culinary trends change. As shown in  Figure 8, this has served Chefs’ well as 
we estimate that all of its major categories carry healthy gross margin rates. We anticipate 
that the company will continue to augment its offerings both by adding depth to existing 
categories and breadth by entering new categories.  Historically, this has occurred organically

Sales productivity based gap analysis—robust earnings power at non-New York 
facilities.  In  Figure 9, we present a sales productivity based gap analysis that is intended to 
demonstrate   the   robust   earnings   power   of   the   company’s   non-New   York   facilities.   
Essentially, the analysis projects earnings power if these facilities were to reach the same sales 
productivity (as measured by sales per square foot) as the New York facilities.  Our analytic 
conclusion is that EPS would increase by $0.55.

                                                          were generated from the Bronx facilities (59% in greater New York and 8% in New England), 
                                                          which made sales productivity (sales per sq ft) there 2.3x that of the rest of the business.  In 
                                                          our experience analyzing retail and distribution food merchants, we have found that EBIT per 
                                                          sq ft has a geometric relationship to sales per sq ft.  In other words, food merchandisers with 
                                                          greater  sales  productivity  generate  disproportionately  greater  profit  dollars  and  margins.   
                                                          This is the power of the well-known productivity loop shared by most best-in-class merchants.  
                                                          Lastly,  we  note  that  our  estimation  process  includes  the  conservative  assumption  that 
                                                          corporate expenses are allocated on a pro rata (with sales) basis.  Management believes that 
                                                          only the Los Angeles market presents structural challenges to achieving like profitability on 
                                                          like sales productivity, given the region’s inherently greater distribution stem miles. 

                                                          Acquisition-Driven Growth 

                                                          We are bullish on Chefs’ strategy to ramp up acquisitions. First, the company’s reputation for 
                                                          excellence precedes it when it enters new markets; simply put, many potential customers are 
                                                          already  eager  to  do  business  with  Chefs’.    Second,  the  company  boasts  state-of-the-art 
                                                          information systems that are critical to maximizing operating efficiencies for distributors (see 
                                                          our IT systems analysis on pages 16–17).  Third, Chefs’ boasts a successful record of accretive 
                                                          acquisitions. We have found that this combination of cultural and systems excellence is the 
                                                          best predictor of success for acquisitions for food merchandisers. 
                                                           

We believe Chefs’ has                                     Track  record  of  success.     As  shown  in  Figure  10,  recently  Chefs’  has  consummated 
                                                          acquisitions at about a rate of one per year.  These have served three purposes: new market 
materially improved 
                                                          entry, new category entry, and tuck-in deals (consolidate existing markets).  We believe Chefs’ 
operations and profitability of                           has materially improved the operations and profitability of its acquisitions by leveraging its 
its acquisitions by leveraging                            superior competitive position and systems capabilities; these include its sourcing capabilities 

its superior competitive                                  to provide an expanded product offering, sales force training, and installation of its warehouse

We estimate an increase in                Acquisition sales growth could ramp to 6% annually, EPS accretion to vary by

acquisition activity could 
                                          sales growth versus the 3% average in recent years.  We anticipate that EPS contribution 
contribute 6% to annual                   would vary by the type of deal with acquisitions in existing markets being more immediately 
sales growth versus the 3%                accretive than in new markets.  We estimate that a 6% incremental sales growth acquisition 
average in recent years                   could add some $0.08–$0.12 to near-term EPS if it were a tuck in an existing market and 
                                          $0.02–$0.05 to near-term EPS for new market entry. Over time we would expect the new 
                                          market acquisition to mature to a similar EPS contribution rate as for tuck-in deals. 
                                           
On a normalized basis, we                 Harry Wils deal illustrates accretion of tuck-ins.   On June 24, 2011, Chefs’ closed its

project the Harry Wils 
                                          distribution and corporate facilities, was completed in less than a week.  Further, most of 
acquisition will be $0.09/sh–             Wils’ $22M in LTM sales was retained. As shown in  Figure 13, on a normalized basis, we

this kind of tuck-in                      be 33%–45%.  We view this kind of tuck-in acquisition as the best use of Chefs’ capital going

COMPANY BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION 

Headquartered  in  Ridgefield,  CT,  The  Chefs’  Warehouse,  Inc.,  is  the  nation’s  premier 
importer and distributor of specialty food products. Chefs’ client-base includes more than 
7,000  independent  restaurants,  hotels,  casinos,  private  clubs,  caterers,  food  distributors, 
culinary schools, and specialty food stores.  Because of this diversification, the top ten clients 
accounted for less than 10% of net revenue totaling $330M in 2010.  By sales, independent 
restaurants are the largest customer segment (65%), followed by hotels and casinos (9%), food 
retailers (7%), private clubs (6%), and caterers (4%).   
 
On average, Chefs’ fills 11,000 orders per week at fill rate of 99% , a result of a first-
class  logistics  platform  and  nationwide  footprint  of  distribution  centers.    Chefs’  seven 
distribution  centers,  fleet  of  138  delivery  trucks  (all  leased),  and  six-day-a-week  delivery 
schedule (in most markets) gives Chefs’ the ability to deliver various drop sizes in a timely 
manner, typically within a two- to three-hour window.  Most orders are filled within 12–24 
hours.    The  company  employs  571  hourly,  salaried,  and  commissioned  employees  (which 
includes 125 sales professionals) with a target sales professional-to-client ratio of 1-to-65.   
 
Strong distribution infrastructure.  As detailed in  Figure 14, Chefs’ Warehouse leases 
seven distribution centers in six markets: New York; Washington, DC; Miami; Las Vegas; Los 
Angeles; and San Francisco.  Chefs’ two Bronx-based distribution centers comprise 47% of the 
company’s 372K square footage ,  followed by an 80K-square-foot facility in Los Angeles.  The 
company anticipates relocating its Miami operations to a 27,000 square foot facility (from 
10,000 square feet currently) in Q3’11.  
 
Chefs’   is   the   largest   distributor   of   specialty   food   products   in   New   York; 
Washington, DC; San Francisco; and Los Angeles .  The company supplies at least one 
product per week to 60%+ of NYC addressable markets and 20%–30% in the remaining five 
markets.

As shown in  Figure 15 , the company was founded as Dairyland USA Corporation in 1985 and 
has grown from a local New York distributor to the nation’s premier importer and distributor 
of  specialty  foods.    In  1999,  Chefs’  entered  the  Washington,  DC,  market  through  the 
Greenfield expansion and has continued to expand to West Coast and south Florida markets 
via acquisitions.  In August 2011, The Chefs’ Warehouse completed an initial public offering of 
10.35M shares (including overallotment), which raised net proceeds of $63.1M.

                                        Chefs’ robust technology platform allows the company to better leverage its cost 
                                        structure.    Over   the   past   three   years   (2007–2010),   Chefs’   expense   ratio   improved 
                                        (contracted) 333 bps, which was significantly better than the 55 bps contraction at SYY and 49 
                                        bps  contraction  at  UNFI.    These  systems  have  been  crucial  to  Chefs’  ability  to  efficiently 
                                        integrate acquisitions.  Chefs’ completed the integration of Harry Wils & Company’s inventory 
                                        and systems in a 48-hour period, a feat few (if any) competitors can duplicate.  We believe the 
                                        company’s investment in technology will continue to be a key driver of Chefs’ profit growth.  
                                         
                                        The Chefs’ Warehouse uses Roadnet , a UPS-developed routing and logistics planning 
                                        software program designed to reduce routing time, lower distribution costs, improve resource 
                                        utilization,  and  monitor  driver  and   vehicle  performance.    Roadnet’s  GPS  and  vehicle 
                                        monitoring software tracks driver progress relative to delivery schedules and monitors 500 
                                        key vehicle metrics such as hard braking, idling, and fast starts.  This system also enables 
                                        Chefs’ to create dynamic routing which minimizes miles driven without sacrificing service.  
                                         
                                        The  company  also  utilizes  a  state-of-the-art  warehouse  management  system, 
                                        currently  integrated  in  the  primary  Bronx  distribution  center  with  full  integration  in  the 
                                        remaining  six  distribution  centers  expected  by  Q1’12.    This  system  provides  real-time 
                                        inventory visibility and is used in conjunction with advanced forecasting tools to maintain 
                                        optimal inventory levels.  Additionally, the company uses a truck builder dimensional-based 
                                        pallet technology that builds pallets based on weights and sizes, thus, maximizing delivery 
                                        efficiency while minimizing excess inventory.  According to management, the company has

                                        margin on sales of protein items and the receipt of a multiyear customs rebate (increased 20 
                                        bps).  Gross profit dollars increased 19.6% to $26.3M from $21.9M in the prior-year period. 
                                         
                                        SG&A Expense.   For Q2’11, operating expenses increased 14.2% yr/yr to $19M while the 
                                        corresponding  ratio  contracted  75  bps  to  19.11%  from  19.86%,  driven  by  improved  cost 
                                        controls and operating leverage from strong sales.  Results included $200K of non-recurring 
                                        costs from the recently closed Harry Wils acquisition.

Operating Profit.   Q2’11 operating  profit rose 36.5% to $7.3M from $5.3M in the year ago 
period while the related ratio expanded 95 bps to 7.34% from 6.39%.  Adjusted EBITDA was 
$8.1M versus $6.2M in Q2’10 while the related margin expanded 78 bps yr/yr to 8.19%.   
 
Net Income.   Net interest expense fell 18.6% to $0.4M while other income was nil versus a 
$0.2M loss in the year-ago period.  The effective tax rate expanded 10 bps to 39.1%, resulting 
in net income of $4.2M, up 35.1% from $3.1M in the similar period last year.   

Financial Forecasts 

Our  quarterly  and  annual  income  statement  projections  are  presented  on  pages  25–26, 
followed by our balance sheets and cash flow estimates on pages 27 and 28, respectively.  
Below we discuss the assumptions underlying our financial forecasts.   

Income Statement, Capital Expenditures, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Our income statement forecasts are predicated on the following general assumptions: 
•   Strong organic sales growth supplemented by announced acquisitions (we do not model 
    for unannounced acquisitions) 
•   Stable to slightly rising gross margins 
•   Contracting expense ratios driven by leveraging fixed costs 
•   Free cash flow is applied to pay down debt 
 
Company guidance—53-week 2011 and long-term EPS growth 
Management recently set 53-week 2011 financial guidance that included: 
•   Sales of $384M–$392M, up 16.3%–18.7% 
•   GAAP EPS of $0.41–$0.44 
•   Pro forma EPS of $0.76–$0.79 
The company had previously provided long-term:  
•   Organic revenue growth of 7%–10% in existing markets 
•   Consistent gross margins 
•   Operating and interest expense leverage 
•   Organic EPS growth of 17.5% 

2011 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Income Statement.   For 53-week 2011, we forecast sales growth of 19.2% to $393.7M from 
$330.1M in 2010, driven by internal sales growth of 12.6% yr/yr, 4.2% yr/yr growth from 
acquisitions and another 2.4% from the 53rd week.  We estimate gross profit growth of 20.7% 
to $103.5M from $85.8M and gross margin expansion of 32 bps to 26.3% from 25.98% in 
2010.  We project a 14.1% increase in SG&A costs to $74.8M from $65.6M and an 86 bps 
contraction of the corresponding ratio to 19% from 19.86% in the prior year.  Consequently, 
we forecast 2011 operating profit of $28.7M, up 42.1% from $20.2M in the prior year.  As a 
percent of sales, we project operating margin expansion of 118 bps to 7.3% in 2011 from 6.12% 
in 2010.  We project 2011 EBITDA of $30.3M, up 35.8% from $22.3M in the prior year.  We 
estimate net interest expense of $1.7M and a 10 bps expansion of the tax rate to 39.1% from 
39%.  Thus, we forecast net income of $16.5M, up 42% from $11.6M in 2010. We estimate 
diluted shares outstanding at 20.8M; thus, we forecast 53-week core EPS of $0.79.  On a 
calendarized basis (to 52 weeks), our 2011 forecast is $0.77.  
   
Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow.   We estimate 2011 cash capital expenditures 
of $1.5M, up 32% from $1.1M in 2010, driven by the relocation in warehouse operations in 
Miami.  We forecast the Harry Wils acquisition and miscellaneous investments will put total 
capital costs at $10M.  We project cash flow from operations at $13.5M in 2011. Thus, free 
cash flow is projected to total $3.5M, or $0.17/sh. 

2012 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 

Income  Statement.     For  2012,  we  forecast  sales  growth  of  10%  to  $433M,  driven  by 
internal sales growth of 9.5% yr/yr, a 2.7% contribution from acquisitions, partly offset by a 
2.2% drag from comparing with 53-week 2011.  We estimate gross profit gains of 9.8% to 
$113.7M from $103.5M and gross margin contraction of 5 bps to 26.25%.   We project a 5.6% 
increase in SG&A costs to $79M from $74.8M and a 75 bps contraction of the corresponding 
ratio to 18.25% from 19% in the prior year.  Consequently, we forecast 2012 operating profit of 
$34.6M, up 20.6% from $28.7M in the prior year.  As a percent of sales, we project operating 
margin expansion of 70 bps to 8% in 2012 from 7.3% in 2011.  We forecast 2012 EBITDA of 
$36.4M, up 20% yr/yr.  We estimate a 25.1% decline in net interest expense, to $1.3M and a 
10 bps contraction in the tax rate to 39%.  Thus, we forecast net income of $20.3M, up 23% 

                                                                                  20 of 31 

                                                                                             359
---------------------Page 21---------------------

                                                                                                                                   

                                       from  $16.5M  in  2011.    Diluted  shares  outstanding  are  estimated  to  total  21M;  thus,  we 
                                       forecast 2012 EPS of $0.97.  
                                          
                                       Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow.   We estimate 2012 cash capital expenditures 
                                       of $8.5M, as we anticipate the company will consolidate both NY distribution centers into a 
                                       larger facility.  We project cash flow from operations at $20M in 2012. Thus, free cash flow is 
                                       projected to total $11.5M, or $0.55/sh. 

                                       2013 Income Statement, Capital Expenditure, and Free Cash Flow Projections 
                                       Income Statement.    For 2013, we forecast sales growth of 10.5% (all internal) to $478.4M.  
                                       We estimate gross profit growth of 10.7% to $125.8M and gross margin expansion of 5 bps to 
                                       26.3%.  We project an 8.1% increase in SG&A costs to $85.4M and a 40 bps contraction of the 
                                       corresponding ratio to 17.85% from 18.25% in the prior year.  Consequently, we forecast 2013 
                                       operating profit of $40.4M, up 16.7% from $34.6M in the prior year.  As a percent of sales, we 
                                       project operating margin expansion of 45 bps to 8.45% in 2013 from 8% in 2012.   We forecast 
                                       2013 EBITDA of $42.3M, up 16.3% yr/yr.  We estimate a 63% decline in net interest expense 
                                       to $0.5M.  Thus, we forecast net income of $24.4M versus $20.3M in 2012.  We estimate 
                                       diluted shares outstanding at 21.2M; thus, we forecast 2013 core EPS of $1.15.  
                                          
                                       Capital   Expenditures   and   Free   Cash   Flow.     We   project   that   2013   cash   capital 
                                       expenditures  of  $2M  on  anticipated  facility  maintenance  and  $0.7M  of  miscellaneous 
                                       investments will put total capital costs at $2.7M.  We forecast cash flow from operations at 
                                       $24M in 2013. Thus, free cash flow is estimated to total $21.3M, or $1/sh.  

                                       VALUATION 

                                       We View Chefs’ Warehouse as Modestly Undervalued 

Chefs’ Warehouse appears               As shown in  Figure 23, based on the primary valuation metrics we normally use, Chefs’ 
                                       Warehouse appears moderately undervalued versus the median valuation for its peer group of 
moderately undervalued 
                                       leading  food  merchandisers.    Specifically,  CHEF’s  forward  P/E  ratio  based  on  estimated 
versus the median valuation            calendar 2012 EPS is 14.0x versus 17.0x for the group, or a 18% discount; its EV/EBITDA 
for its peer group of leading          based on forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA is 8.9x versus the group at 9.1x, or a 2% discount; 
food merchandisers                     its EV/sales based on projected calendar 2012 sales is 0.75x versus the group at 0.82x, or a 
                                       9% discount. 
                                        
                                       UNFI is the group member that we think is the best direct comparable for CHEF.  CHEF 
                                       trades at a 23% discount to UNFI on forecasted calendar 2012 P/E and an 8% discount on 
                                       forecasted calendar 2012 EBITDA, but an 92% premium on forecasted 2012 sales.  Given that 
                                       we forecast CHEF’s 2012 EBITDA margin at 8.4% versus 4% for UNFI, we consider CHEF’s 
                                       valuation premium based on EV/sales appropriate. 

                                       Intermediate-Term Fundamentals Stronger than Peers 
                                       While  most  of  its  standard  valuation  metrics  are  at  a  moderate  discount  to  its  peers,  we 
                                       forecast  that  Chefs’  intermediate-term  fundamentals  will  outperform.    For  example,  we 
                                       forecast calendar 2012 yr/yr EPS growth for CHEF of 26% versus 16% for the group median 
                                       and Chefs’ calendar 2012 yr/yr EBITDA growth at 20% versus 15% for the group median.   

                                       We Derived Our $20 Price Target Using a Forward P/E Methodology 
                                       We generally apply forward P/E valuation methods to growth stocks, and we certainly view 
                                       Chefs’ that way.  Based on its strong fundamentals, we believe that CHEF’s will ultimately be 
                                       revalued up to the group median of 17.0x calendar 2012 EPS from 14.0x currently.  
                                        
                                       Thus,   we   have   applied   the   group   median   multiple   to  derive   our   $20   price   target. 
                                       Mathematically,  we  take  the 17.0x  group  multiple  and  apply  it  to  our  calendar  2013  EPS 
                                       forecast of $1.15 to yield our $20 price target. 
                                        
                                        

                                                                                                                           21 of 31

RISKS 

We view the following as important risk factors regarding an investment in CHEF and to 
achieving our price target.  

Cyclicality of Demand Tied to High End Consumer Sentiment 

Chefs’ revenue is closely correlated to consumer sentiment among high-end consumers.  As 
shown in  Figure 24 , during the 2008/2009 recession, Chefs’ experienced four sequential 
quarters of negative internal sales growth that averaged –9.6%.  This was closely linked to a 
steep decline in the Luxury Consumption Index during that period.  Conversely, CHEF’s sales 
rapidly improved (with about a 6 month lag) to the recovery in the Index since then. 
 
Despite the severity of the downturn of 2008/2009, Chefs’ earnings rose during that period as 
it nimbly right-sized the business and completed two accretive acquisitions.  Aided by the 
flexibility of employing a non-union work force, the company eliminated 10% of its fleet with 
an associated reduction in drivers, warehouse labor, and G&A expenses.

Concentration of Business in Greater New York 

Chefs’ greater New York market, which spans from Boston to Atlantic City, accounted for 65% 
of 2010 sales.  Risks associated with this concentration include potential adverse regional 
economic trends and potential catastrophic events.   
 

                                                                                       23 of 31

Fuel Price Inflation  
Year to date, we estimate that Chefs’ fuel costs have averaged 70 bps of sales (or 50 bps net of 
fuel surcharges to customers). As detailed in  Figure 25, this is similar to 81 bps for UNFI and 
60 bps for SYY.  We estimate a $0.10/gallon increase in fuel would increase Chefs’ pretax fuel 
expenses by $75K; thus a $1/gal increase would negatively impact EPS by just $0.02.

Product Cost Inflation and Relative Pricing Power 

Investor concern regarding food merchandisers’ ability to pass through inflating product costs 
is both a perceived and potentially real risk. As shown in  Figure 26, Chefs’ adjusted gross 
margin expanded 21 bps and 43 bps, respectively, in Q2’11 and Q1’11. This compares favorably 
to respective contractions 57 bps and 27 bps for SYY.  Over the long term, CHEF has normally 
had  stronger  pricing  power  than  SYY  as  well.    Only  during  2008  did  CHEF  materially 
underperform SYY when its margin contracted 55 bps and SYY was flat.

Acquisition-Related Risks 
Chefs’ strategy to substantially grow via acquisitions entails certain risks. The two generic 
risks associated with horizontal acquisitions are around execution and asset quality. While 
Chefs’ history of successful acquisitions does not preclude it from these risks in the future, we 
believe it does suggest a company that is highly capable of navigating potential pitfalls.  Based 
on its strong management team and information systems, we view execution risk as relatively 
minor in the intermediate term.  Risks around asset quality can often, but not always, be dealt 
with via valuation (i.e., pay more for better companies and less for weaker ones).  Regardless, 
we  believe  management  must  remain  diligent  to  avoid  acquisitions  that  could  materially 
dilute Chefs’ culture of excellence. 

CONCLUSION 

We view Chefs’ Warehouse as well positioned to continue to gain market share in the specialty 
foodservice distribution sector.  Thus, we have forecasted strong growth in sales and earnings 
for the near and long term.  With a moderately undervalued equity currently, CHEF’s stock 
presents a timely investment, in our opinion.

BB&T Capital Markets Ratings System: 
The BBTCM Equity Research Department Stock Rating System consists of three separate ratings. The appropriate rating is 
determined by a stock’s estimated 12-month total return potential, which consists of the percentage price change to the 12-
month price target and the current yield on anticipated dividends. A 12-month price target is the analyst’s best estimate of the 
market price of the stock in 12 months. A 12-month price target is highly subjective and the result of numerous assumptions, 
including company, industry, and market fundamentals, both on an absolute and relative basis, as well as investor sentiment, 
which can be highly volatile.   
 
The definition of each rating is as follows:  
 
Buy (1): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 10%  
Hold (2): estimated total return potential greater than or equal to 0% and less than 10% 
Underweight (3): estimated total return potential less than 0%     
 
NR: Not Rated 
NA: Not Applicable 
NM: Not Meaningful 
SP: Suspended 
 
Stocks rated Buy (1) are required to have a published 12-month price target, while it is not required on stocks rated Hold (2) 
and Underweight (3).
