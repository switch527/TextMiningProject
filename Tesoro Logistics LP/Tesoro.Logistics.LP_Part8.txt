                                       Organic projects and dropdowns support growth 
                                       TLLP has approximately $97mm of organic pr            ojects (net of parent reimbursements) 
                                       through 2013. In addition, TLLP plans to do        its first dropdown in early 2Q11, which we 
                                       estimate at $65mm. The combined $162mm of or ganic projects and dropdown is expected 
                                       to generate approximately $50mm or an attrac          tive blended multiple of 3.2x (assuming 
                                       organic projects at 2.3x and dropdown at 8.0x). Cash flow stability from the expansion 
                                       capex is supported by long-term contracts with TSO.  

                                       In December 2011, TLLP announced $80mm of  new organic projects, comprised of crude 
                                       gathering and truck volume expansions in           the Bakken and refined product terminal 
                                       expansions. In the Bakken, TLLP is adding         approximately $53mm of new projects to 
                                       increase crude gathering capacity on its High         Plains system and trucking capacity to 
                                       accommodate TSOâ€™s growing demand for Ba  kken crude. Combining TSOâ€™s 10,000 bpd 
                                       Mandan refinery expansion, 30,000 bpd Anacort es rail project and gathering expansions in 
                                       the Bakken, TLLPâ€™s High Plains system is expected to add 50,000 bpd of new volumes by 
                                       2013, raising its total volumes to more than 100,000 bpd. 

                                       On the trucking side, TLLP is expanding its fleet and expects volumes to increase 10,000 
                                       bpd to 35,000 bpd by 2013. In addition, TLLP        lengthened its trucking contract with TSO 
                                       from 2 years to 5 years and increased mini mum volume commitments from 22,000 bpd to 
                                       27,000 bpd in 2012 and 32,000 bpd in 2013. The remaining new projects comprise 
                                       approximately $27mm for terminal expansions   at Los Angeles, Stockton and Mandan. 
                                       Including previously announced storage proj        ects, TLLP plans to invest approximately 
                                       $40mm on terminal projects through 2013, wh           ich is expected to increase volumes by 
                                       40,000 bpd to approximately 185,000 bpd.

                                        First dropdown expected early 2Q12 
                                        Management announced the first dropdown will be the Martinez, CA crude oil marine 
                                        terminal serving TSOâ€™s 166,000 bpd Golden Eagle  refinery (TSOâ€™s largest refinery). Expected 
                                        close is early 2Q12. While management did not provide a purchase price (terms still being 
                                        discussed), we assume a pric  e tag of approximately $65mm based on 8x multiple on 
                                        EBITDA of $8mm.  

                                        The Martinez crude oil marine terminal is       comprised of 145,000 bpd of wharf capacity, 
                                        425,000 bpd of storage capacity and interconnecting pipes. Similar to other TLLP assets, the 
                                        Martinez terminal cash flows will be supported by a 10-year contract with TSO with 
                                        minimum volume commitment for 90% of projected volumes of 70,000  bpd. Given TLLPâ€™s 
                                        high liquidity ($100mm of availability on $150mm revolver) and low leverage (Debt/EBITDA 
                                        1x), we expect the dropdown and growth projec  ts to be financed with debt. In addition, 
                                        TLLP anticipates expanding its revolver from  $150mm to $300mm in association with the 
                                        Martinez dropdown.  

                                        4Q Review 
                                        Q4 EBITDA $14.1mn vs. our estimate of $15.5mn and consensus $15.3mn. Distributable 
                                        cash flow was $12.6mn vs. our $13.5mn estimate. Variance to our estimates was 
                                        attributable to higher operating expenses more  than offsetting higher crude pipeline and 
                                        trucking volumes. Costs increased due to higher third-party trucking costs and repairs to 
                                        the High Plains Pipeline (from last summer rain). The Partnership increased its quarterly 
                                        distribution 3.6% QoQ and 7.4% above its initial quarterly distribution, to $0.3625 per unit 
                                        ($1.45 annualized), above our $0.35 estimate. Distribution coverage came in at 1.11x.

Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 07-Feb-2012, USD 33.38), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect       or (the "sector
coverage universe"). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors 
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or 
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i       n an advisory
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
