      We believe that Tesla can compete successfully over the long-term                             Tesla Motors
      We believe that Teslas deep technical talent, head-start in EV technology, low               S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)                 
      development costs, unique product offe  ring, low cost financing, and already-
      ubiquitous brand name position the co.  to succeed in bringing competitive veh's       Performance (%)        1m                          3m                       12m
      to market. We expect strong demand / profi tability in the med-term (20k Model S       Absolute       22.1                                
                                                                                             S&P 500 INDEX    9.1      -0.6       12.5
      sales would enable $250MM-$300MM of EBITDA in 2013). And we expect a 
      promising future beyond this, based on product expansion. The shares appear fully     
      valued at this point, however, and we initiate coverage with a Hold rating. 
                                                                                            
      Innovative battery approach leads to key cost / driving range advantages 
      Teslas success in using groundbreaking pack aging and electronics technology to 
      enhance the durability and safety of lo w-cost, high-energy consumer electronics-
      style lithium-ion cells has resulted in a cu rrent battery pack cost that we estimate 
      at ~$470 / kWh, compared to ~$650 / kWh  for the rest of the industry (assuming 
      similarly low volumes).  And we believe that future packs (expected in 2012) could 
      approach $300 / kWh, which would be dr         amatically lower than mainstream 
      automakers.  Lower cost and higher energy should enable Tesla to produce 
      vehicles with unparalleled performance (r ange of 160-300 miles compared to 100 
      for most other planned EVs).  Teslas approach has been validated by Daimler and 
      Toyota, each of which are current shareh     olders and are using Tesla packs in 
      prototype EVs. 
      Low-cost business model / strong execution to-date give us confidence 
      Earnings appear quite strong on only 20k  Model S units, which appears to be very 
      achievable in the context of the premiu m midsize segment, and we believe that 
      the company can break-even at roughly 50%  of that volume. Capital needs have 
      been mitigated by a low-cost DOE loan,       and an ability to purchase PP&E at 
      distressed prices. Access to th e Toyota parts bin (and Toyotas material cost) is 
      particularly advantageous with respect   to material cost. Current management 
      initiated a cost-reduction program that to ok the company from -10% gross margin 
      in 1Q09 to +21% in 1H10, despite lowe       r YOY unit volumes, which gives us 
      confidence in our 22% gross margin projection for the Model S. 
      We have arrived at a $17 price target for the companys shares 
      based on a DCF analysis (see page 32 for detail).  Key risks include execution on 
      the scale up from niche to volume manufa cturing, risks associated with demand 
      and avg transaction price assumptions, ri  sks associated with costs projections, 
      and unknowns associated with the future  competitive landscape (we believe that 
      Teslas competitors are now aggressively purs uing electric vehicles).  In addition, 
      we anticipate limited near term revenue/e arnings to support the stock (i.e. until 
      launch of the Model S in 2012).  Conseque ntly, we anticipate that Teslas shares 
      can exhibit high levels of near term volatility.

                                Outlook 
                                We believe that Teslas deep technical talent, it s head-start in EV technology, its low product 
                                development costs, unique product offering,     low cost DOE financing, and an already-
                                ubiquitous brand name, position the company to  succeed in bringing competitive vehicles to 
                                market.  We expect strong demand and profitab ility in the intermediate term (20k Model S 
                                sales would enable Tesla to generate $250MM-$300MM of EBITDA in 2013).  And the 
                                company has a promising future beyond this starting point, based on a growing product 
                                portfolio. Teslas success in using groundbreaki ng packaging and electronics technology to 
                                enhance the durability and safety of low-cost, high-energy consumer electronics-style lithium-
                                ion cells has resulted in cost and driving range  advantages versus the EV offerings of Teslas 
                                competitors.  And the company s technological approach has be en validated by Daimler and 
                                Toyota, each of which ar e current shareholders.  The shares  appear fully valued at this point, 
                                however, and thus our Hold recommendation. 

                                Valuation  
                                Our price target of $17 is based on a DCF ana  lysis.  Valuing Tesla presents a unique set of 
                                challenges, given the fact that company reve  nue wont accelerate until 2012 and beyond.  
                                We believe that DCF is the most appropriate valuation method in this case.  We assume 7% 
                                terminal growth beginning in 2020 (given our proje ction that Tesla will still be building out its 
                                vehicle portfolio and that only 9.5% of global sales will be vehicles able to be fueled from the 
                                grid in 2020, we believe that an 7% growth rate  is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT 
                                margin of 11.7% and a weighted average cost  of capital of 13.5% (we calculate WACC by 
                                using 15% cost of equity and 3.3% cost of   DOE debt and weight this over the expected 
                                capital structure from 2010  2014). 

                                Risks 
                                Key downside risks include execution on the sc ale up from niche to volume manufacturing, 
                                risks associated with demand and average tran  saction price assumptions, risks associated 
                                with costs projections (note that manufactur    ing is largely U.S. based, and in formerly 
                                unionized facilities), and unknowns associated  with the future competitive landscape (we 
                                believe that Teslas competitors are now aggressively pursuing electric vehicles).  In addition, 
                                we anticipate limited near term  revenue/earnings to support the stock (i.e. until launch of the 
                                Model S in 2012, or further ramping of Tesl    as powertrain business).  Consequently, we 
                                anticipate that Teslas shares may exhibit high levels of near term volatility. 

                                Upside could be derived from higher-than-ex pected Model S volumes or Powertrain sales 
                                contract wins. Given volumes of competitor ve  hicles in the 50k - 200k range, there is the 
                                potential for Tesla Model S volume to be sign      ificantly higher-than- expected. Additional 
                                customers / contracts for Powertrain sales could add significantly to our revenue / profitability 
                                targets (i.e. if current Toyota / Daimler de    velopment contracts turn into commercial 
                                production contracts).

                                Key points: 

                                    Innovative battery approach gives Tesla driving range and cost advantage, and puts them 
                                    years ahead of competitors.  The Tesla Road ster achieves 4.6 miles of range per kWh of 
                                    battery storage (244 miles of range / 53kWh   battery), compared to 4.2 for the Nissan 
                                    Leaf (100 miles / 24kWh), 3.4 for the Mini  E (120 miles / 35kWh), and 2.5 for the Chevy 
                                    Volt (40 miles of electric driving range / 16kWh). 

                                    One platform, one powertrain strategy coul       d facilitate unparalleled flexibility and 
                                    operational/financial e fficiency within the Auto Indust  ry (it typically costs automakers 
                                    $500 MM - $1 bn to develop a vehicle.  Te     sla is at $100-$400 MM).  Wed note that 
                                    development costs (R&D and Capex) for Tesla  s current vehicle, the Roadster, were 
                                    $125MM. 

                                    Execution risk has been mitigated by abil      ity to poach world-class automotive / 
                                    engineering talent (Head of manufacturing is  from Toyota.  Head of Engineering is from 
                                    Lotus.  Head designer is from VW and Mazda.    Head Aerodynamicist is from Ferrari.  
                                    Head of purchasing is from SAP.  CFO is fr  om Ford.  Head of HR / Recruiting is from 
                                    Google). 

                                    Purchase of NUMMI, a high volume auto manufacturing plant formerly owned by Toyota 
                                    and General Motors, further mitigates execution risk. 

                                    Company has shown an ability to execute  As  evidenced by the gross margin increase 
                                    for the Roadster, rapid launch of the Roadst er Sport/right hand drive models, and rapid 
                                    prototyping of Toyota and Daimler powertrains/vehicles. 

                                    Price point / segment positioning / performance of Model S avoids most EV competition, 
                                    enables the high-cost of the powertrain to fi   t within a high price point vehicle, and 
                                    positions the company for maximum total cost of ownership benefit.  Our Gross Margin 
                                    expectations in the low 20% range appears          realistic compared to other luxury 
                                    automakers; particularly as Tesla owns its own distribution. 

                                    Low cost business model - Earnings appear        quite strong on only 20k units, which 
                                    appears to be very achievable in the context of the premium midsize segment. 

                                    If volume doesnt hit the ta  rget, the company can break-even at roughly 50% of our 
                                    projected volume. 

                                    Teslas technology has been validated through partnerships with Daimler / Toyota.  
                                    Access to the Toyota parts bin (and Toyotas  material cost) is particularly advantageous 
                                    re: cost and engineering / design resources. 

                                    Tesla has access to low cost   capital / facilities / equipm ent. Capital needs have been 
                                    mitigated by a low cost DOE loan, and the ability to purchase PP&E at distressed prices. 

                                    The powertrain business has the potential to      surprise to the upside and provide a 
                                    revenue bridge to 2012. 

                                    Key risks include execution on the scale up   from niche to volume manufacturing, risks 
                                    associated with demand and average transaction price assumptions, risks associated 
                                    with cost projections (note that manufactur  ing is largely U.S. based, and in formerly 
                                    unionized facilities), and unknowns associated with the future competitive landscape (we 
                                    believe that Teslas competitors are now aggressively pursuing electric vehicles).  In 
                                    addition, we anticipate limited near term revenue/earnings to support the stock (i.e. until 
                                    the launch of the Model S in 2012, or furth  er ramping of Teslas powertrain business).  
                                    Consequently, we anticipate that Teslas sha  res may exhibit high le vels of near term 
                                    volatility. 

                                    We have arrived at a $17 target for Teslas shares.  We have used a DCF methodology to 
                                    value Teslas shares.  The DCF incorporates   7% terminal revenue growth beginning in

                                    2020 (given our projection that Tesla will still  be building out its vehicle portfolio and that

                                    believe that a 7% growth rate is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT margin of 
                                    11.7% and a weighted average cost of capital  of 13.5% (15% cost of equity and 3.3% 
                                    cost of U.S. Department of Energy-funded debt).   

                                 

                                Company Overview 

                                Tesla was founded in 2003 to deve lop an electric sports car,  the Tesla Roadster, which was 
                                launched in 2008, and is still the only highway ca pable electric vehicle on the market in the 
                                U.S.  But since Teslas formation, vehicle electrification has gained much greater significance.  
                                We believe that a number of factors, includ ing concerns about dependence on oil, increased 
                                societal concern about climate change,        regulatory change (driving improved fuel 
                                economy/CO2 regulations), and significant advancements in battery technology/cost have the 
                                potential to drive profound changes for the global auto industry over the next five to ten 
                                years, including a significant rise in penetration rates for Electric Vehicles.  At the same time, 
                                Tesla has gained worldwid e recognition for its electric driv etrain engineering and innovation.  
                                Based on products on the market, and those      (that we know of) under development, we 
                                believe that Tesla is currently at the leading edge of performance and cost for EV technology, 
                                while achieving impressive benchmarks for battery  pack safety and life expectancy.  Tesla 
                                has 72 patents issued and applied for - 30 for th e battery pack.  Innova tions in digital motor 
                                controllers, charge controller, traction contro l, pack controls, vehicle management, battery 
                                management, power electronics design are significant differentiating advantages. 

                                Teslas first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, de  monstrated the companys electric powertrain 
                                capabilities.  And they are curren tly in production of their se cond generation of powertrain 
                                technology, having reduced the cost of their   powertrain by 31% from Gen 1.0 to Gen 2.0 
                                (October 08  October 09).  Version 3.0 will coin cide with the launch of the next model in 
                                2012, and is expected to achieve an additional  36% reduction in cost, while achieving further 
                                improvement in performance. 

                                Teslas competitors have taken notice, and have taken steps 
                                which validate the companys leadership position  

                                Daimler recognized the companys advanced  development, and the company took a 10% 
                                equity stake in Tesla in May 2009 for $50MM (Aabar took 40% of this stake in July 2009).  
                                Daimler and Tesla have since begun collabora      tion on several projects, with Daimler 
                                increasingly relying on Tesla for the supply of   battery packs and chargers, accelerating 
                                Daimlers initiatives in this market.   

                                Toyota and Tesla announced in July 2010 that they would collaborate on production of a fleet 
                                of prototype Toyota RAV4 EVs with Tesla powertr ains, and Toyota also  took an equity stake 
                                ($50 MM) in the company.  Toyota has also announced a goal to bring a production version of 
                                the vehicle to market in the U.S. in 2012. 

                                Several other automakers have also initiated   discussions with Tesla for the use of Teslas 
                                powertrain technology, reinforcing our view    that Tesla remains at the forefront of EV 
                                Powertrain technology.

                                And we believe that Tesla is positioned well for its next phase of 
                                growth 

                                Tesla is now transitioning from being a niche   manufacturer of high priced ($100K+) sports 
                                cars, to becoming a full fledged manufacturer and marketer of luxury automobiles with a long 
                                term objective of competing against product o fferings from BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Infiniti, 
                                and Lexus. 

                                We have confidence that Tesla has the potential  to meet its operational objectives, including 
                                the launch of its first high volume vehicle,  the Model S, on time and on budget.  Our 
                                confidence is in part derived from the depth   of experience of individuals that the company 
                                has brought on board from the worlds leadi ng automakers and suppliers.  Over the past 15 
                                months, Tesla has engaged in an aggressive e  ffort to target and recruit some of the best 
                                talent in the world in key automotive functional areas such as automotive design, 
                                engineering, and manufacturing.  We have been  very impressed with the level of engineering 
                                talent brought on board in areas such as elec tric powertrain technology, stamping, casting, 
                                vehicle assembly, safety, aerodynamics, steeri   ng and suspension, paint, manufacturing, 
                                purchasing, and other key areas.  Tesla has been  able to attract world renowned talent from 
                                companies including Toyota, Honda, Mercedes,  Audi, Ford, Ferrari Ra cing, Williams Racing, 
                                Laepple, and others.  Consequently, we believe th at Teslas internal design, engineering, and 
                                manufacturing capabilities rival those of the worlds leading global automakers. 

                                Led by a very demanding CEO, the companys cu lture is based on vision and speed, and it 
                                prides itself in being able to apply a Silicon Valley Operating System in order to accelerate the 
                                pace of innovation in the Auto Industry.   

                                One of the best examples of the companys adh erence to its vision is the decision to move 
                                ahead with the development of a battery pack   consisting of laptop-size batteries, despite 
                                near-unanimous skepticism from the battery industry and traditional automakers. The 
                                decision and ultimate success of using low cost, en ergetic laptop cells has paid off so far, as 
                                the cost of the current Roadster pack is well  below the most competitively priced advanced 
                                automotive packs available in the world (w e estimate ~$470 per kWh at ~1,000 units per 
                                year ($25k cost of the 53kWh pa ck), compared to our  estimate of the industry average of 
                                ~$650 per kWh at 10k-20k units per year).  In terms of performance, we estimate that Teslas 
                                packs can facilitate a driving range of 4.6 mi les per kWh compared to  3.5-4.2 miles for most 
                                other batteries (based on EPA 2-cycle test).   

                                We also believe that Tesla has the capacity to  move faster than its automotive peers.  In part 
                                due to its organizational structure, and in part  because of the caliber of talent brought in from 
                                the auto and other industries.  The compan     ys focus on one vehicle platform and one 
                                powertrain (EV powertrains are uniquely capabable of this level of flexibility) is also key in this 
                                regard.  The company employs an interactiv     e approach, with designers, engineers, and 
                                manufacturing personnel working adjacent to one  another, able to collaborate on an ad hoc 
                                basis and solve problems quickly.  This is       in stark contrast to the silod/functional 
                                organizational structure of traditional auto makers, where the slowest member of the team 
                                drives the pace of progress, and where problems need to be elevated to higher management 
                                who have to allocate their time between several platforms / powertrains.  

                                One of the best examples of the company       s speed is their approach to pitching their 
                                powertrain business to prospective automaker customers.  Instead of preparing a Powerpoint 
                                presentation or displaying off- the-shelf examples of their work, Tesla has purchased one of 
                                the automakers vehicles (from a dealer), and ac tually converted it to an EV.  This has been 
                                accomplished in the past in as little as two week s.  We have no doubt that, for a traditional 
                                supplier / automaker, it would take at least a mo nth just to receive approvals to purchase the 
                                vehicle and likely 6 months to complete a conversion.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                        

                               We consider TSLAs management team to be very strong and 
                               well-equipped to compete long-term with traditional OEMs 

                               Elon Musk 
                               Chairman, Product Architect and CEO 
                               Musk is known as a hard-driving CEO that in     spires innovative, tireless work out of his 
                               employees.  He has also shown a strong abilit   y to secure investment / partnership deals 
                               (evidenced by the partnerships with Daiml    er and Toyota) and generate value for those 
                               investors (Daimlers $50MM investment is now worth $145MM). Wed also note that Musk 
                               took over the CEO role in October 2008, and  spearheaded a successful cost-down program 
                               that enabled Teslas margin to improve to +8% in 2Q09 from -10% in 1Q09.  The company 
                               has been gross margin-positive ever since, despite low volumes. 

                               Musk previously started Internet companies Zip2  and PayPal. In addition  to his Tesla duties, 
                               he serves as CEO and CTO of SpaceX, and he's Chairman of SolarCity. 

                               JB Straubel 
                               Chief Technical Officer 
                               As a co-founder of Tesla, Straubel has overs een the technical and engineering design of the 
                               vehicles, and is considered the product arch    itect of Teslas powertrain, work that is 
                               considered groundbreaking by indu stry insiders.  Prior to Tesla, JB was the CTO and co-
                               founder of the aerospace firm, Volacom, which  designed a specialized high-altitude electric 
                               aircraft platform using a novel power plant. At   Volacom, JB invented and patented a new 
                               long-endurance hybrid electric propulsion concept  that was later licensed to Boeing. Before 
                               Volacom, JB worked at Rosen Motors as   a propulsion engineer developing a new hybrid 
                               electric vehicle drivetrain based on a micro  turbine and a high-speed flywheel. JB was also 
                               part of the early team at Pentadyne, where he   designed and built a  first-generation 150kW 
                               power inverter, motor-generator controls, and magnetic bearing systems. 

                               Deepak Ahuja 
                               Chief Financial Officer 
                               Deepak Ahuja brings a wealth of finance experience within the automotive industry to his role 
                               at Tesla, including a long career at   Ford.  We believe that certain of his roles at Ford are 
                               particularly well-suited to his role at Tesla, part icularly CFO for Ford of Southern Africa ($3 bn 
                               subsidiary) and CFO for Auto Alliance Internat ional (Ford / Mazda JV with over $4 billion in 
                               revenue), both essentially enterprise management   positions. His career at Ford included 
                               assignments in all aspects of the business, including Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales, 
                               Treasury, Acquisition and Divestitures.  Ahuja also has a technical background, having worked 
                               as an engineer for Kennametal, Inc. for almost 6 years. 

                               Franz von Holzhausen 
                               Chief Designer 
                               Prior to joining Tesla, Franz was Director of   Design at the Mazda North American Design 
                               Center. While at Mazda, Franz pioneered the Nagare surface language design philosophy, led 
                               design of the Mazda RX-8, Tribute, and Mazda5 production vehicle facelifts, and was 
                               instrumental in the design development of  the 2009 Mazda6 and Mazda3.  He previously 
                               designed the Pontiac Solstice at GM (a highly  respected vehicle in terms of design), and held 
                               design positions at Volkswagen prior to that.  

                               Gilbert Passin 
                               Vice President, Manufacturing 
                               Given Passins prior experience in spearheading the launch of 200k unit vehicle platforms, we 
                               have confidence in his ability to guide the launch of the 20k unit Model S.  Passin has had a 
                               23 year international automotive career, includi  ng leading high-profile divisions at Toyota, 
                               Volvo, Mack and Renault across North America  and Europe. Most recently, Passin served as

                                manufacturing of the award-winning tenth generation Corolla. 

                                Peter Rawlinson 
                                Vice President & Chief Engineer 
                                Prior to Tesla, Peter led vehicle engineering at Corus Automotive, an engineering consultancy 
                                specializing in advanc ed engineering solutions for the global motor industry, where he 
                                worked on many product development programs  for Ford / Jaguar / LandRover, the BMW 5-
                                Series, and others.  

                                Peter is an expert in crash safety and alumin um stamping engineering, two areas that will be 
                                critical to an on-time launch of the Model S.   He led development of the Think electric vehicle 
                                platform, which was done with only 5 engineers in 6 months. That vehicle was recognized as 
                                having the best crash safety performance in th e subcompact vehicle class globally.  Before 
                                Corus, Peter served as Chief Engineer of      Advanced Engineering at Lotus, where he 
                                pioneered the use of advanced aluminum body        structures, bonding cast elements with 
                                stampings and extrusions, an approach subseq  uently widely adopted within the industry. 
                                Vehicles using this approach include Aston Mart ins, the new Jaguar XJ, the current Audi A8 
                                and the Audi TT.

                                Lithium-ion cells used for consumer electronics applications are cheaper and store 
                                more energy than advanced automotive lithium-ion  Only Tesla is taking advantage 
                                of this 
                                The primary constraint on electrifying vehicles has always been electricity storage.  Lead acid, 
                                nickel cadmium, and nickel metal hydride ba     tteries have achieved progressively higher 
                                energy density (the amount of energy that can be  stored per unit of weight / volume), but are 
                                never expected to achieve the levels necessary   to enable a reasonable amount of driving 
                                range (given the constraints on size / mass in  herent in automobiles) for a plug-in hybrid or 
                                pure electric automobile.  Lithiu m-ion battery technology has lo ng held promise to alleviate 
                                this energy storage problem.  And the desirable properties of this technology, relative to 
                                other battery types, can be seen in the near    -exclusive use of rechargeable lithium-ion 
                                batteries in the consumer electronics industry.   

                                Consumer electronics-type lithium-ion batteries ha ve improved significantly over the last 15 
                                years, based on economies of scale and techno     logy refinements, with cost declining to 
                                ~$250 / kWh from ~$2,000 / kWh in 1995 and en ergy density improving to ~230 wh/kg from 
                                90 wh/kg over the same time-frame.  But the co nsensus view of the battery and automotive 
                                engineering community had been that consumer   electronics type lithium-ion batteries (i.e. 
                                cobalt oxide cells) were not viable for automoti  ve applications, due to life expectancy and 
                                safety (chemical stability) issues.  The in  dustry opted instead to develop Advanced 
                                Automotive Lithium-ion  batteries, which, in relation to  consumer electronics batteries, use 
                                different chemical compositions and larger form-f actors to achieve longer life and improved 
                                safety.  Although these advanced batteries      now appear ready for commercial-scale 
                                automotive applications, they will require signifi cant scale and technological improvement to 
                                match the cost and energy density of consumer-electronic type batteries.  We believe that, at 
                                the cell level (costs do not compare to p  ack level costs we discuss elsewhere in the 
                                report), advanced automotive ba tteries achieve energy density of 150-160 wh/kg compared 
                                to 220-230 for consumer-electronic batteries.   And automotive type cells cost $350-$400 per 
                                kWh, compared to $250 / kWh for consumer-el      ectronics type cells.  The combination of 
                                lower energy storage properties and higher co     st between these battery types is not 
                                expected to be fully closed for 5-10 years. 

                                Desire for range and first-mover status led Tesla to use consumer electronics batteries 
                                In the interest of getting a car on the road as soon as possible, and utilizing the cost and 
                                energy storage advantages of consumer-electron ic cells, Tesla is using innovative battery 
                                pack technology and electronics  to extend the life and enhanc e the safety of mass-produced 
                                consumer electronics type cells (which have  been tweaked somewhat to optimize them 
                                for automotive).  This has resulted in significant advantages in cost and driving range (detailed 
                                below).  It has also enabled Tesla to produce and sell a highway-ready EV several years ahead 
                                of its competition.  Given the companys start -up status, the lessons learned from actually 
                                functioning as an automaker since 2008 (i.e.   optimizing the EV po wertrain, manufacturing 
                                thousands of battery packs, and developing all  the processes that go along with marketing / 
                                selling / servicing vehicles) represent valuable ex perience and, in our opinion, vastly reduces 
                                the risk of significant issues when the companys higher-volume Model S is introduced.   

                                    1) We estimate that the cost of the   53kWh Roadster pack is $25k (~1,000 units per 
                                    year).  This is ~$470 / kWh (Pack level co    st), which compares to current cost of 
                                    advanced automotive batteries (assuming approximately 10k-20k batteries per year) of at 
                                    least $650 / kWh.  Based on technologica      l improvements and higher scale, Tesla 
                                    believes that the Model S battery pack will be  64% of the cost of the Roadster pack (on 
                                    a per kWh basis), which implies ~$300 / kWh co st.  Advanced automotive battery packs 
                                    are not expected to reach that cost level until the end of the decade.

                                    Model S.  Assuming 20k units, the Model  S program will use 8MM-10MM cells per month, 
                                    which is 4.5% of the current Consumer Electr            onics lithium-ion market (estimated to be

                                battery, many of the concerns of the battery   community over Teslas strategy have been 
                                allayed.  And in many  circles, Teslas engineering work  is considered groundbreaking, which 
                                is validated by the investments in Tesla by Daimler and Toyota, each of which are planning to 
                                use Tesla powertrains in at least early versions of the companys EVs (Daimlers Smart 
                                ForTwo EV already uses Tesla powertrains).   

                                However, there remains some disadvantage in       life expectancy.  Compared to advanced 
                                automotive batteries, which are expected to su  stain 80% of original performance (driving 
                                range) after 10 years / 150k miles, Tesla states that the Roadster battery will sustain 65% of 
                                its original performance after 7-10 years / 100k -150k miles and that the Model S will sustain 
                                65% after 10+ years and 150k miles.  This disadvantage becomes less stark when 
                                considering that 65% of the 160  300 miles of   Model S range (depending on battery size 
                                chosen by the customer) is still significantly hi gher than 80% of the ~100 mile range of most 
                                other EVs. 

                                Automakers appear to favor purchasing cells, and manufacturing packs and motors in-
                                house; this is exactly the strategy Tesla has pursued for years 
                                We also find it interesting (a nd very advantageous) that Te sla has chosen the exact same 
                                make vs. buy strategy that many automakers now appear to be pursuing  to purchase 
                                battery cells from outside suppliers and to   engineer / produce everything else in-house 
                                (battery pack, battery management  electronics / software, electr ic motors).  We believe that 
                                traditional automakers will ultimately be successf  ul, but Tesla clearly has a head-start of 
                                several years. 

                                Tesla is battery cell-agnostic and we expect  will eventually use advanc ed automotive cells, 
                                once the hard work of the worlds battery-mak ers results in enough improvement in cost and 
                                energy density to justify a change.  We expect  that the pack / battery management expertise 
                                Tesla has developed and used in enhancing        consumer cells will continue to yield an 
                                advantage in optimizing advanced cells.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                           

                                The Roadster has been a success  

                                The Tesla Roadster, in producti  on since 2008, is essentially a validation platform for the 
                                companys powertrain, as well as a dry-run for     many of the sales / servicing / logistical 
                                processes that the company will employ in the   future.  The body / chassis is produced by 
                                Lotus off of the Lotus Elise platform (althoug  h a significant portion of the Roadster body 
                                components were designed and sourced by Tesla).  1,204 Roadsters have been sold to-date, 
                                and the company has a contract to purchase  1,196 more gliders from Lotus, prior to Lotus 
                                changing platforms.  At the current run rate, this vehicle should continue to generate 
                                ~$18MM-$22MM of quarterly revenue, through to the Model S launch in mid-2012, based on 
                                125  155 unit sales per quarter.   

                                Considering the many compromises that fitti ng Teslas powertrain into another companys 
                                existing platform entailed (issues with driver ingress / egress, relatively spartan interior, et al), 
                                we consider the vehicle a significant success.  It proved-out the powertrain technology, drove 
                                significant brand awareness, and gave us a favorable indication of the companys ability to 
                                execute. 

                                Execution ability:  We believe that the Roadster experience  is a significant positive indicator 
                                of Teslas viability and ability to successfully launch the Model S.  The most impressive 
                                example of the companys blocking and tackling  ability is its ability to plan and implement 
                                cost-saving and revenue-enhancement initiatives that led to a ~18% gross margin on the 
                                Roadster in 1H10, a significant turnaround from 10% gross margin in 1Q09. 

                                Wed also note that the non-powertrain portion   of the Roadster is far from an off-the-shelf 
                                Lotus Elise.  Although Lotus did produce the vehi cle body / chassis (referred to as a glider), 
                                many of the components were specifically designed and sourced by Tesla (of the 50% of the 
                                vehicle content that was non-powertrain, 33%  was designed and sourced by Tesla), which 
                                gave the company significant design / engineering / purchasing experience.  

                                Technology validation:  As stated above, the powertrain has performed well.  Driving range 
                                (which fluctuates according to driving style) has been as advertised.  There have been no 
                                safety issues, despite two major crashes.  An  d the companys long-distance test vehicles 
                                continue to perform well at 80k+ miles.   

                                Brand awareness:  Although its difficult to measure, it is clear that Tesla is the most well-
                                known of the several start-up electric vehicle  makers that plan vehicles.  The company was 
                                named one of Americas Hottest Brands by Advertising Age in November 2009, despite no 
                                traditional advertising to-date and no advertising agency of record.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                         

                               Model S  From a vehicle with many compromises to an 
                               uncompromising vehicle 

                               Tesla intends to compete with Audi, BMW, an  d Daimler in the luxury performance sedan 
                               segment initially against conven tional vehicles, and eventua lly against EV entries.  The 
                               company's deep technical talent (validated by  strong Roadster execut ion to-date), already-
                               ubiquitous brand name, unique product offering  (likely no EVs in the Model S price / vehicle-
                               type segment through 2014) and low cost DOE fina ncing, leads us to believe that they will 
                               succeed in bringing a competitive vehicle to ma rket and encounter suffi cient demand to sell 
                               20k vehicles per year (and likely generate $250MM-$300MM of EBITDA). Tesla's strong 
                               head-start in EV technology and low product development costs leads us to believe that the 
                               company can grow off the Model S base and   compete successfully in the long-term, even 
                               against EV entries of the traditional OEMs. 

                               Volume (20k units), revenue per unit ($86,400), and gross margin (21.8%) for the Model S are 
                               the key drivers underpinning our expectation of  $278MM of EBITDA in 2013.  Based on the 
                               analysis below, we believe that each of these projections is achievable. 

                               20k units is very achievable in the context of competitor volumes 
                               The Tesla Model S is a 4-door, 5-passenger        (excluding a 3rd row of seats that can 
                               accommodate 2 children) performance sedan that  is intended to ben chmark (and exceed, 
                               according to Tesla) the BMW 5-Series in every  way.  The base Model S  is priced in the U.S. 
                               at $49,900 (after the $7,500 federal EV credit), which is directly on top of the BMW 535i 
                               (base price of $49,600).  We would note, though,     that the expected average price of the 
                               Model S to a customer in the U.S. (after rebates   and carbon credits) is $74k.  On a pricing 
                               basis, this puts the Model S at the midpoint  of the midsize luxury sedan segment (BMW 5-
                               Series, Mercedes E-Class) average transaction   price of ~$60k and the large luxury sedan 
                               segment (BMW 7-Series, Mercedes S-Class) average transaction price of ~$90k. 

                               We believe that entering the luxury sedan segm ent has significant advantages, including:  1) 
                               the Model S is likely to be the only luxury PH  EV / EV available at least through 2013; 2) 
                               consumers in this segment are less price-sensiti ve (although the base Model S is equivalent 
                               to the 535i, the average transaction price is projected to be significantly higher); and 3) the 
                               fuel savings are significantly more compe  lling when competing against a 20mpg BMW, 
                               rather than the 30+ MPG vehicles to whic     h the more mainstream segment EVs will be 
                               competing.  

                               The performance sedan segment is approximately  800k units per year globally, so Tesla is 
                               looking to be 2.5% of that market (wed note th at, in the US, the Toyota Prius, at 140k units 
                               in 2009, was 8.1% of the 1.7MM unit lower mi  dsize market).  Given the price point of the 
                               Model S, however, it may be more appropriate to consider the large premium sedan 
                               segment plus the high-end models of the  midsize premium sedan segment (assume ~15% 
                               of total midsize premium segment).  Under this scenario, Model S would need to achieve 6% 
                               of a 325k unit global market.  Overall, we    believe that Teslas volume expectations are 
                               achievable, particularly as: 

                                    This will be a unique offering in that we dont expect any EVs in the luxury segment until 
                                    at least 2014.  Were confident that a unique, outwardly notable product like the Model S 
                                    will garner significant consideration from the affluent consumers in this market, given the 
                                    scarcity of choices.  The only vehicle on  the radar screen at this point is the BMW 
                                    Megacity EV, but, based on limited information from BMW, this looks to be a much 
                                    smaller vehicle, with significantly less driving range.  We dont consider the Fisker Karma 
                                    to be a competitor due to its $80k+ starting price.

                                              The Model Ss driving range of 160-300 miles  (depending on consumer choice of battery 
                                              size) greatly reduces the range anxiety issue,   which we believe significantly increases 
                                              the vehicles addressable consumer base.  We  continue to highlight that we know of no 
                                              other electric vehicle planned with a driving range of more than ~100 miles. 

                                              The Model Ss competitive set is significan             tly less fuel efficien t than the mainstream 
                                              compact / midsize cars that most prospective EVs will be competing with.  As illustrated 
                                              in Figure 4 below, the a  nnual fuel savings versus a BMW 740i (17mpg) / BMW 535i 
                                              (21mpg) is ~$1,500 / ~$1,100, while versus                 a Honda Civic (30mpg), the annual fuel 
                                              savings is only $660.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                                                                

                                         Average transaction price is likely the biggest swing factor 

                                         As stated above, the average price to the customer that we project for the Model S is $74k in 
                                         the U.S. ($76.5k globally), which compares to  ~$60k for its midsize luxury sedan competition 
                                         and ~$90k for its large luxury sedan competit  ion.  The revenue to Tesla, however, will be 
                                         substantially higher when you consider the $5,000 - $9,000 of government subsidies available 
                                         in many high-volume markets (countries representing at least 58% of the 2009 global 
                                         industry have subsidies in this range), not to mention many local areas with incremental 
                                         benefits.  And carbon reduction   credits, which we expect   to be $2,500 per unit globally.  
                                         Given those factors, as well as somewhat higher pricing in Europe and ROW than the U.S., 
                                         we arrive at an average revenue per unit of $86,400 for the Model S globally. 

                                         Wed note that our estimate of $86,400 includes the following assumptions: 

                                               The Model S will offer 3 battery options, with respective ranges of 160 / 230 / 300 miles.  
                                               The base model will come with the 160 mile battery, with each additional 70 mile 
                                               increment being priced at ~$9k.  We assume 20% / 60% / 20% split of volume. 

                                               We are projecting that non-battery option                 content will add $13k.    This represents a 
                                               20.5% uplift on the global average base pri ce, based on the Roadster, which is currently 
                                               achieving that same uplift.   

                                               Regarding carbon reduction c redits, Tesla currently receives ZEV (zero-emission vehicle) 
                                               credits for any Roadster sold in California                 or the 13 states that match Californias 
                                               emission laws.  It is currently selling those c redits to OEMs that are not in compliance 
                                               with Californias ZEV requirements.  The co  mpany generated $8.15MM of ZEV Credit 
                                               revenue in 2009 on total Roadster volume of   830 units ($9,800 per vehicle).  Its clear 
                                               that in 2012 there will be a high er volume of ZEVs being sold and the price paid for the 
                                               credits may go down based on a higher su                    pply.  However, wed note that the U.S. 
                                               federal fuel economy program (CAFÉ) will in clude a credit trading mechanism whereby 
                                               those OEMs that are below the standard can sell credits to those OEMs that are in non-
                                               compliance.  And Europe is also expected to have some form of trading system (the 
                                               penalties for non-compliance with th                   e European emissions program increase 
                                               substantially beginning in 2012).   Given these factors, we bel ieve that just over $3k per 
                                               U.S. and European vehicle is achievable for the Model S.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                                 

                                  Model S Gross margins look to be in the low 20% range 

                                  Tesla is projecting long-term gross margins of 25% for the company.  Our model 
                                  incorporates 22% margins in the first full year  of Model S production (assuming 20k units).  
                                  Given the expectations for a relatively rich mix  of option and battery-size content, driving an 
                                  average revenue per unit in the mid-$80k range, we believe these margins are reasonable.   

                                  In evaluation of the margins, we benchmark Te       sla against other luxury manufacturers, as 
                                  illustrated below:

                                  In the context of these comparisons, it appears that Teslas margin projections are in-line with 
                                  other OEMs.  Clearly, the lower volume of Tesl  a is a negative in terms of scale; however, 
                                  considering that manufacturing fixed costs are   only a small part of the overall cost of the 
                                  vehicle (even at 20k units), we believe the scal   e negatives can be offset by the following 
                                  positives: 

                                      In owning its own distribution, Tesla will ca pture the ~10% discount versus MSRP that 
                                      traditional OEMs cede to their independent dealer-body.  We expect that the cost of the 
                                      dealerships, contained in SG&A, will represent approximately 4% of Model S revenue 
                                      (based on 60 dealerships by the end of        2013, with $1.2MM op ex per dealer, over 
                                      $1,725MM of Model S revenue in 2013).  So we expect a 6% benefit vs. other OEMs. 
                                      Despite low volume, Teslas ability to use      off-the-shelf Toyota / Lexus parts enables 
                                      some of the vehicles components to be purchased at a cost based on very high-scale. 
                                      A significant portion of Teslas COGS will be  components produced in-house.  Given the 
                                      companys lean structure and   the savings from not paying margin to a supplier, we 
                                      believe there could be cost savings from these activities. 
                                      Labor cost advantage  Tesla expects   labor costs to be approximately $35 per hour, 
                                      including benefits.  We believe that this assumes a non-unionized workforce. Wed note 
                                      that, even if the companys workforce did organize, the latest UAW agreement with GM, 
                                      Ford, and Chrysler, set per-hour costs for   new hires at ~$42 per hour for production 
                                      line workers and ~$25 per hour for non-producti  on line workers, so we believe  that 
                                      Teslas projections would still be approximately the same.   
                                      Tesla is building a plant and a production line at a time of capacity reductions in the auto 
                                      industry, which means there is a significant amount of manufacturing equipment 
                                      available at distressed prices (e.g. NUMMI         plant itself, stamping presses, paint 
                                      equipment, robotics, etc).  This will aid in   overhead absorption and mitigate the scale 
                                      disadvantage versus some of the example  OEMs above.  Tesla is buying the NUMMI 
                                      plant for $42MM, compared to the $200  MM-$250MM that a typical production plant 
                                      would cost to build from scratch (ex land   cost).  Another example is the nearly brand-
                                      new stamping press that Tesla purchased from a bankrupt supplier for $4MM (compared 
                                      to $40MM-$50MM new).

                                            Our estimates for the breakdown of Model S COGS are below.  The key points wed highlight 
                                            are as follows: 

                                                  As with most vehicles, the gross margin on   the base vehicle is relatively low while the 
                                                  incremental margin on optional content is qu ite high.  This reinforces the importance of 
                                                  average transaction price. 

                                                  Fixed Cost  Direct Labor:  We consider labo                      r to be fixed, although it likely can flex 
                                                  somewhat.  There is a clear break-point around  10k units, as the plan for the Model S is 
                                                  to produce 20k units on two shifts.  Be                   low, we estimate $2,000 per vehicle, which 
                                                  implies $40MM over 20k units (600 workers @ ~$33 per hour @ 2,000 hours per year).  It 
                                                  is likely that the company could produce r  oughly 10%-20% additional vehicles without 
                                                  adding a shift.  Conversely, if volume was be low ~12k units, Tesla likely could reduce to 
                                                  1 shift and $20MM of fixed cost. 

                                                  Fixed Cost  Overhead:  We estimate that manufacturing overhead will be $80MM in the 
                                                  2013/2014 time-frame, which is $4k per vehicle (assuming 20k units). The majority of the 
                                                  cost is D&A of ~$50MM with the remainder made up of indirect labor, energy costs, etc.

                                            Higher level of vertical integration of Model S (relative to Roadster) is a cost 
                                            opportunity, but introduces additional risk 
                                            On the vertical integration scale, Tesla is pursuing the traditional OEM model, intending to 
                                            produce as high a level of content in-house as  possible (i.e. powertrain, stamped body parts, 
                                            and potentially plastic interior panels, will be                 internally produced), while the other electric 
                                            vehicle OEM start-ups, such as Fisker and Co                      da, are on the other end of the spectrum, 
                                            intending to utilize suppliers for nearly all of th e vehicle content and then just assembling the 
                                            parts.  Although the vertical integration stra                   tegy adds risk, in terms of increasing the 
                                            engineering / design load on Teslas organiza                      tion, it also enables the company to take 
                                            advantage of its lean structure, enables them                      to take advantage of low cost production 
                                            equipment being sold at distressed prices, and                      helps them avoid passing along margin to 
                                            suppliers.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                          

                                Wed also note that higher levels of vertic   al integration (and the resulting capture of 
                                component profits) is one of the factors that drives our belief that Tesla has a legitimate 
                                chance to compete with established OEMs ov       er the long-term.  Traditional automotive 
                                suppliers are not set-up for niche-level volu  mes, which leads to premium pricing for low 
                                volume programs.  Teslas organization / cost structure, on the other hand, is completely built 
                                around profitability at low volumes.  

                                Below are the areas of differentiation, with respect to vertical integration, between the Model 
                                S and the Roadster: 

                                Powertrain:  Essentially no change in in tegration.  Battery pack and motor will continue to be 
                                internally produced, although produ ction of each will be moved to  a new Palo Alto facility 
                                (battery pack until recently wa s produced at Teslas facility in San Carlos, CA and motor 
                                produced at a Taiwan subsidiary).  The Power El    ectronics Module (the unit that converts 
                                energy in the battery to current that powers the  motor) will continue to be produced by a 3rd 
                                party in Taiwan. 

                                Body:  The Roadsters Glider (essentially every thing but the powertrain) is currently 30% 
                                Lotus Elise-shared parts, 35% supplied compon ents sourced by Lotus (designed by Tesla), 
                                and 35% supplied components sourced by Tesl  a (designed by Tesla).  Therefore, Teslas 
                                design responsibility will go from 70% to 100%, as the company transitions to the Model S. 
                                In-house production of stamped body parts wi  ll be new, as well as Body Shop and Paint 
                                Shop aspects of assembly (this is done by Lotus  for the Roadster). All-in-all, we believe that 
                                up to 60% of material cost may be produced in-house. 

                                 

                                With very little incremental investment, Tesla can produce 
                                differentiated vehicle models.  Expecting 4 vehicles in the 
                                portfolio by 2016 (plus Model S Cabriolet) 

                                Once the Model S is launched in 2012, Tesla expects to introduce a new model (off the same 
                                platform) every 1.5 years (these additional variants off the Model S platform are referred to as 
                                Top Hats).  The next-generation Roadster  is expected in 2013, followed by a crossover / 
                                SUV in 2015 (DB estimate), a light-commercial   van in 2016 (DB estimate), and a Model S 
                                Cabriolet (within the 2014-2016 time-frame). 

                                Ultimately, the company has plans for an addition al platform, intended to support a family of 
                                smaller, less-expensive vehicles, similar to a BMW 3-Series. 

                                Tesla believes that total investment for th ese new top hats is $100MM each (50% R&D 
                                Expense / 50% Capex).  This compares to ~ $250MM for a traditional OEM.  The savings is 
                                due to the fact that essentially no work needs to be done to any of the parts below the belt-
                                line (of the passengers), as well as the lean, fa  st structure of Tesla engineering described 
                                above. 

                                In addition, we would highligh t the fact that EV powertrains are considerably more flexible 
                                than traditional powertrains, which require a significant amount  of engineering (or completely 
                                different designs) for different applications (i.e . small cars, large cars, crossovers, pickups, 
                                vans, SUVs).  In contrast, a single EV powertrain has the flexibility to be deployed in nearly all 
                                light vehicle applications (in part due to th e EV Powertrains flat torque curve).  The 
                                companys ability to build an entire portfo   lio of products around a single powertrain 
                                represents a significant competitive advantage, in our opinion.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                         

                               We believe that with 4 different vehicles in  the portfolio, Tesla can conservatively approach 
                               35k units by 2017 (15% CAGR from 2013), $3.3bn in revenue (14% CAGR from 2013), and 
                               $529MM in EBITDA (17% CAGR from 2013). 

                               The Powertrain business could provide upside surprises, and is 
                               essentially a free option as our DCF places very little value on the 
                               segment       
                               Tesla intends to sell low-cost, low-risk EV powertrain assemblies / battery pack assemblies to 
                               other OEMs.  We are projecting 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 revenue of $19MM / $53MM / 
                               $75MM / $109MM for this activity.  Overall, we don t expect this to be a large business for 
                               Tesla in the long-run, as we believe that traditional OEMs intend to develop their own 
                               expertise in this area.  However, in the near -term, Teslas elegant powertrain solution could 
                               be a valuable way for an OEM to quickly get an   EV to market.  At a relatively high-volume 
                               price of ~$10k per unit (assuming $400 per kWh fo r a 25kWh pack), it would only take 15k 
                               units per year to more-than-double our 2013 powertra in sales forecast.  We believe that this 
                               business is underappreciated, could provide upside surprises during the period preceding the 
                               Model S launch (as illu strated by the recent Toyota anno uncement), and is essentially a free 
                               option, as our DCF places essentially no value on the powertrain segment.   

                               Tesla currently has 3 disclosed powertrain programs with Daimler: 

                                    Contract to supply 1,000 battery packs and char gers for Daimlers Smart Fortwo electric 
                                    vehicle (this will likely be increased to 1,500.   Tesla began shipping packs / chargers in 
                                    late 2009.  We estimate $20k per unit, and fo  r the total 1,500 units to be delivered by 
                                    mid-2011.  Although $20k seems high, we bel      ieve that, based on Teslas Roadster 
                                    powertrain costs, it is likely that the price  could come down to the $7k-$8k range given 
                                    higher volume (10k-15k units). 
                                    Contract to assist with development and prod uction of battery packs and chargers for a 
                                    pilot fleet of Mercedes A-Class electric    vehicles.  Tesla has begun to recognize 
                                    Development Services revenue and will likely begin shipping packs / chargers in 2011. 
                                    Contract to develop modular battery packs for a  Freightliner electric delivery van.  Initial 
                                    prototype batteries were shipped in 1Q10. 

                               In July, Tesla and Toyota announced that Tesla would develop and sell prototype batteries for 
                               a Toyota RAV4 EV.  The development will start immediately, with prototype packs likely being 
                               delivered in the near-term.  Toyota has announ  ced that they intend to market the vehicle 
                               commercially beginning in 2012.  If Tesla were to  get the supply contract for the commercial 
                               production, we estimate a conservative reven ue opportunity of $150MM per year (15k units 
                               at $10k per battery (25kWh battery at $400 per kWh)). 

                               Finally, the company is also look ing into electrical grid energy  storage opportunities.  Tesla 
                               has an R&D agreement with Southern California  Edison to adapt their battery pack for grid 
                               applications. 

                               Wed note that Daimler has a limited exclusivity agreement with Tesla.  Tesla can sell 
                               powertrain components to anyone (i.e. battery   packs, chargers, motors, etc.), but Daimler 
                               has right of first refusal on Tesla selling an i ntegrated powertrain to another OEM in a non-
                               Tesla branded vehicle.  The agreement lasts   until July 2013, but does not appear to be a 
                               significant issue, as evidenced by the Toyota agreement.

                                                       We expect Teslas EBITDA and net income expected to turn positive once Model S 
                                                       production reaches 4,000+ per quarter (late 2012 / early 2013) 
                                                       Based on our assumptions, detailed below, we                                        see Teslas earnings and cash flow turning 
                                                       significantly positive once Model S production ra mps to a 20k unit per year run-rate in early 
                                                       2013.  And wed note that our model includes  significant spending on future vehicles during 
                                                       this time-frame.  As well detail below, the                                company can break even (on a net income and 
                                                       cash flow basis) above 10k units per year, if spending on future vehicles is delayed.

                                       In terms of sensitivities, we consider the key swing factors to be volume, overall pricing level, 
                                       and average level of option content / battery rang e.  The table below illustrates sensitivities.  
                                       We estimate that Teslas decremental margin on  overall volume is ~29% (projected revenue 
                                       per unit of $86.4k less variable costs of $61.5k).    We estimate that the decremental margin 
                                       on option / battery range content is ~44%                    (this content carries a higher margin per 
                                       incremental dollar than the base vehicle).  An d of course, the decremental margin on pricing 
                                       is 100% (could be driven by discounting to                drive volume, or lower-than-expected carbon 
                                       reduction credit revenue, which also carries a 100% margin).

                                                    Our long-term valuation is based on volume projections that would give Tesla similar 
                                                    global market share to Jaguar in the 2020 time-frame (and well-below Porsche) 
                                                    We use Teslas Roadster volume projections                                     through 2012.  We model that Model S 
                                                    production begins on time in 3Q12 (Tesla has a  stretch target for early 2012), and ramps to a 
                                                    20k unit run-rate by 1Q13.  We then model the next-gen Roadster to begin production in mid-
                                                    2013, the Model X (crossover vehi                         cle) in early 2015, the Van (l                   ight-commercial vehicle) in 
                                                    2H16 and the Gen3 Platform (3-Series size vehicle) in 2018.

                                                     Tesla projects that R&D expenses will total 3%-5% of revenue in the 2013 / 2014 time-frame; 
                                                     however, it is unclear how much spending this includes on future models which, if Tesla is on 
                                                     the path to be a full-line luxury automaker, will clearly be meaningful. 

                                                     We are projecting R&D expenses by vehicle pro gram, essentially based on rough projections

                                                more focused near start of production).  Wed also note an assumption that new dealerships 
                                                require ~$600k of capital expenditure.

                                                Significant portion of SG&A expense will be dealership-related 
                                                We expect that Tesla will maintain a lean                             central SG&A structu  re, but will experience 
                                                significant growth due to the expected ramp-u  p of dealerships.  The companys long-term 
                                                target is 5%-7% of sales (excluding stock-ba                           sed comp).  We project the high-6% range 
                                                through 2014, but see potential to reduce this   below 6% later in the decade, depending on 
                                                prospective volumes. 

                                                Another unique aspect of Teslas business model  is to sell vehicles through company-owned 
                                                stores, rather than through independently-owned dealerships, the traditional OEM distribution 
                                                model.  Tesla believes this will lead to the following advantages: 

                                                       Typical luxury OEMs sell vehicl es to their dealers for a 10% -12% discount compared to 
                                                       MSRP.  Tesla intends to capture this discount  by selling its own vehicles.  Compared to 
                                                       the 3.5%-4.0% of sales that we expect dealership operations to cost (plus a bit of 
                                                       depreciation, maybe $5MM-$10MM per year, well  less than 0.5% of revenue), the 10% 
                                                       revenue increase appears to be compelling. 

                                                       Tesla can retain the profit on wa rranty repairs that OEMs typically pay to the dealership.  
                                                       Additionally, company-owned dealerships eliminate the te mptation of dealers to over-
                                                       service when a vehicle is under warranty. 

                                                       Direct feedback, direct contact with customers, compared to a typical OEM, which often 
                                                       will get customer feedback filtered through a dealer. 

                                                Given the uniqueness and initial scarcity value of Teslas product and the companys belief 
                                                that many vehicles will be ordered on-line (or through a central sales system), we believe that 
                                                company-owned dealership model is likely an advantage to the company financially.

                                                 Teslas only debt will be its DOE   loan, which carries interest e ssentially at the same rate at 
                                                 which the Department of Energy borrows from the US Treasury.  We are modeling 3.3%.  At 
                                                 the point when the co mpanys $465MM loan is fully drawn (in 2012), we expect interest to 
                                                 be $15MM per year (annualized run rate). 

                                                 The company currently carries                       approximately $290MM of Ne                       t Operating Losses (as of 
                                                 3/31/10) and has recorded a full va luation allowance against U.S.  taxable earnings.  We dont 
                                                 expect the company to record tax expense or                                   pay cash taxes until these NOLs (and 
                                                 additional that will be accumulated through 2012)  are exhausted.  We expected this situation 
                                                 to last through 2014 and for the  companys prospective tax rate to be in the mid-20% range,

                                        Pretax Income breakeven point looks to be in the 10k unit range 
                                        Based on the analysis below, we believe that  Tesla can break-even at much lower unit sales 
                                        than the 20k per year of Model S that we pro                 ject.  The analysis assumes $80MM of fixed 
                                        cost plus $20MM of direct labor (assuming   only 1 shift with 300 workers, compared to 2 
                                        shifts to produce 20k units).  It also assume s that if early indicati ons for Model S sales were 
                                        lower-than-expected that the company would   not begin R&D spending on future models, 
                                        would slow store growth, and would save on other variable SG&A, leading to Operating 
                                        Expenses ~$45MM lower than the $208MM in our base model for 2013.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                                                                              

                                             Cash usage through 2012 likely to be very close to current 
                                             sources of cash 

                                             We expect that Tesla can generate free cash flow of approximately $200MM per year, once a 
                                             20k unit run rate is reached on the Model S in early 2013.  Until then, however, the cash burn 
                                             will be relatively intense.  Key drivers of cash                   burn, as well as current sources of cash are 
                                             summarized below.  As illust                rated, sources and uses over the next 3 years are nearly 
                                             identical.  Wed note that we are modeling this  assuming there is no cash shortage.  If Tesla 
                                             were to foresee a cash shortage, we believe they                          could delay certain spending (dealership 
                                             openings, R&D on new vehicles, etc.) in order  to conserve cash.  However, given margin for 
                                             error in our modeling, we could certainly fores                      ee scenarios in which Tesla would require 
                                             additional equity funding (likely to be relativ  ely minor) in the 2012 time-frame.  In fact, we 
                                             model a $25MM equity raise in mid-2012, due to fo recasted low cash levels at mid-year, just 
                                             prior to Model S launch.

                                   The loan is specifically broken down as foll ows:  1) $364MM for Model S development and 
                                   manufacturing facility; 2) $  101MM for powertrain development              and facility.  Qualifying 
                                   expenses are:  engineering        expense, tooling investment,   and manufacturing equipment 
                                   investment.  Roadster production costs do not qualify, nor does corporate overhead. 

                                   This is a reimbursement program.  Tesla will submit qualifying expenses for reimbursement 
                                   and the DOE will disburse 80% of the funds for those costs (the loans require 20% equity).  
                                   Given that Tesla had significant qualifying expenses prior to closing the loan, the prospective 
                                   split of costs will be approximately 92% DOE / 8% Tesla.   

                                   Through 2Q10, Tesla has drawn $45.4MM of the loan proceeds.  We expect that the loan will 
                                   be fully-drawn by mid-to-late 2012,  basically concurrent with laun ch of the Model S.  Once 
                                   the loan is fully-drawn, we expect Tesla to begin  paying it down at a pace of at least $50MM 
                                   per year, and we expect cash flow to be sufficien t to fully pay-off the loan prior to the DOE 
                                   warrants vesting in 2018 (the DOE will receive wa rrants to purchase 9.2MM shares of Tesla 
                                   common (vesting beginning in 2018), if the agreed  payment schedule is followed exactly.  If 
                                   Tesla can prepay the loan fully prior to 2018, no warrants will vest). 

                                   The other significant piece of government assistance that Tesla has received is approval for a 
                                   California sales tax credit (9% savings) on u p to $320MM of qualifying equipment, as long 
                                   as its purchased and used in California (CAETFA Sales Tax Exemption).

                                             Valuation 

                                             Our price target of $17 is based on a DCF ana                       lysis.  Valuing Tesla presents a unique set of 
                                             challenges, given the fact that company reve                       nue wont accelerate until 2012 and beyond.  
                                             We believe that DCF is the most appropriate valuation method in this case.  We assume 7% 
                                             terminal growth beginning in 2020 (given our proje ction that Tesla will still be building out its 
                                             vehicle portfolio and that only 9.5% of global sales will be vehicles able to be fueled from the 
                                             grid in 2020, we believe that an 7% growth rate   is reasonable). We assume a terminal EBIT 
                                             margin of 11.7% and a weighted average cost   of capital of 13.5% (we calculate WACC by 
                                             using 15% cost of equity and 3.3% cost of                         DOE debt and weight this over the expected 
                                             capital structure from 2010  2014). 

                                             In terms of a multiple, current EV (based on our DCF valuation and current debt level) implies 
                                             a 5.4x multiple on 2013 EBITDA.  However, this  is not particularly meaningful as 2013 is 2.5 
                                             years away, and the companys net debt levels will increase prior to that time.  We think the 
                                             most reasonable way to look at the valuation                        is by projecting the multiple in mid-2012 (on 
                                             2013 results) on which the stock would need to                          trade to justify purchasing the stock now, 
                                             assuming a reasonable amount of share growth between now and then.  For example, the 
                                             current equity value of Tesla is $1.98 bn                      ($19.59 on approximately 101MM shares).  We 
                                             estimate that an investor would require 15% eq                         uity growth per year to hold TSLA shares.  
                                             Assuming 2 years of 15% growth, equity value  in mid-2012 would be $2.6 bn.  At that time, 
                                             we expect net debt to be approximately $430MM,   resulting in an EV of $3.05 bn, which is 
                                             11.0x our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $278MM (see figure below).   

                                             In the table below, we look at comparative mu                          ltiples for the two U.S. lithium-ion battery-
                                             makers (A123 and Ener1), as well as BYD (a Chin ese lithium-ion battery maker, conventional 
                                             automaker, and prospective EV-maker) and GS                            Yuasa (a Japanese lead-acid battery-maker 
                                             with a lithium-ion business expected to grow ra                        pidly).  On an EV / EBITDA basis, all these 
                                             companies trade at a discount to BYD, but the relative valuations of AONE, HEV, and GS 
                                             Yuasa appear more compelling than TSLA.  Given   the high current valuation, and significant 
                                             amount of share supply that will come out of                         lock-up in early Januar y (only about 13% of 
                                             TSLAs current shares outstanding can cu                        rrently be traded), we would recommend for 
                                             prospective investors to wait for a better entry-point. 

                                             Wed also note that we estimate current valuat ions for Porsche and Ferrari of approximately 
                                             7x EV / EBITDA.

9 August 2010       Autos & Auto Parts  Tesla Motors                                                                            

                                Risks 

                                Key downside risks include execution on the sc ale up from niche to volume manufacturing, 
                                risks associated with demand and average tran  saction price assumptions, risks associated 
                                with costs projections (note that manufactur     ing is largely U.S. based, and in formerly 
                                unionized facilities), and unknowns associated  with the future competitive landscape (we 
                                believe that Teslas competitors are now aggressively pursuing electric vehicles).  In addition, 
                                we anticipate limited near term  revenue/earnings to support the stock (i.e. until launch of the 
                                Model S in 2012, or further ramping of Tesl     as powertrain business).  Consequently, we 
                                anticipate that Teslas shares can exhibit high levels of near term volatility. 

                                Additional Downside Risks 

                                Currency Risk  Value of Euro is substantial  risk factor, given 25%-35% of Model S volume 
                                expected to be in Europe.  Current model based on 1.20 USD / Euro.  We estimate that every 
                                10 cent move in the Euro is an approximate $200MM impact to valuation (~$2.00 per share). 

                                Warranty Cost Risk - Tesla is estimating th   at it will accrue $3,600 per Model S to cover 
                                warranty costs.  Warranty costs significantly abov e this estimate (or a high-cost recall) could 
                                impact profitability and/or the companys balance sheet position.   

                                The Model S pricing estimates assume governmental tax credits / rebates in certain countries 
                                which, although in existence today, are not guaranteed to be in existence in 2012.  
                                Reductions in support could impact the value  proposition for Teslas vehicles and consumer 
                                demand levels. 

                                The segment in which the Model S competes             generally includes    significant leasing 
                                penetration.  Inability to find a lease financing partner could impact demand levels. 

                                 

                                Upside Risks 

                                Key upside would center around potential volume upside.  Given volumes of competitor 
                                vehicles in the 50k  200k range, there is th   e potential for Tesla Model S volume to be 
                                significantly higher-than-expected. 

                                Additional customers / contracts for Powertrain  sales could add significantly to our revenue / 
                                profitability targets.  For example, if Tesla were to receive a contract to produce battery packs 
                                for a future Toyota or Daimler EV (both of wh ich are currently purchasing prototype batteries 
                                from Tesla), this could lead to substantially higher revenues than weve projected.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.
