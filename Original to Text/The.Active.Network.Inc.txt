concerns include the failure to compete successfully against current or future 
competitors, failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, and 
inability to expand business outside North America. The company's failure to 
expand customers' use of its applications and to increase the percentage of

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

  rapidly with high profit margins.

Bears' theses partially misguided, in our view. We've heard two bear theses recently and believe one thesis is overblown.
First, some bears believe ACTV's IP is easy to replicate, indefensible and simply a payment processing engine. Our
customer due diligence sessions have revealed quite the opposite. Customers indicate high satisfaction levels, in general,
and especially with the workflow automation, ease of customization, and the back-end capabilities in addition to the payment
processing engine. So while consumers/investors tend to only see the front-end of the solution (payment processing
engine), the customers we spoke with tend to rave about the solution capabilities to manage their overall business not
just the payments engine. We also think the level of annual R&D spend should allow ACTV to maintain a compelling
technological advantage over the competition, in our view. Second and the other bear thesis is around technology-acquisition
integration risk, which we view as a legitimate risk. As further discussed below, we expect The Active Network to be an
aggressive consolidator of the space. And while acquisition waves create advantages in terms of pricing power and cross-
sell opportunities, it also poses operational risks and could make it difficult for investors to discern The Active Network's
underlying organic growth rate. We think as more customers migrate to the ActiveWorks platform (and the legacy product
R&D spend diminishes) investors will see the margins accrete more meaningfully, which likely will dispel the bears thesis,
though this could take a couple quarters or more to play out.
Believe aggressive M&A strategy makes sense for an 800 lb gorilla. We view The Active Network as the undisputed
leader in the registrations lifecycle management industry with 5x the scale of the nearest competitor and an annual R&D
spend (~$80M in 2012) that is likely greater than most competitors' annual revenue. Our research indicates that The Active
Network is automatically called in to the vast majority of deals and enjoys an unusual level of pricing power for its products.
We therefore believe it is unlikely a small competitor or a new entrant can overcome ACTV's dominant market share, pricing
power and large technological advantage. However, the registrations lifecycle management market is very large, highly
fragmented and despite ACTV's size, the business is less than 10% penetrated in the market today and is less than 5%
penetrated within the Enterprise customer base, in our view. Therefore, given the scale of the Active Network's infrastructure
and existing service-oriented architecture, it makes sense for The Active Network to be "the big consolidator" in the space
and enlarge its market share through an acquisition strategy, in our opinion. The Active Network typically acquires companies
to enter new markets or add new products and/or capabilities to the suite.
Believe Starcite acquisition is visionary, expect the market to follow in 12-24 months. The Active Network is the only
vendor we are aware of that offers an integrated attendee management and spend management solution in the market
today. We think The Active Network is showing significant market vision with the Starcite acquisition and likely has a 12-24
month first-mover advantage before the competition follows. ACTV's strategy for the Meetings Management market could
turn out analogous with Concur's vision to integrate expense management with travel management in 2006, in our view.
We remember the nay sayers at first did not believe travel and expense management capabilities needed to be integrated
and should be stand-alone, but this viewpoint was dispelled by customer purchasing habits, which forced the competition to
follow Concur's market strategy. We think it is a logical direction for the Meetings Management market to combine attendee
management solutions with spend management solutions in an integrated platform. By combining these technologies,
businesses will have greater visibility in forecasting ROI for their events. We also note that the larger ERPs like Oracle
already use The Active Network for their OpenWorld conferences in the US and China, which we think indicates the high-
value of the technology.
Latest platform architecture could lead to larger deals & faster innovation. Most of the largest SaaS companies
we  follow  CRM,  CNQR,  ULTI,  RNOW  have  previously  upgraded  their  platforms  to  the  latest  technologies,  similar  to
Active Network's development of the ActiveWorks platform. ActiveWorks' service-oriented architecture allows for easy
customizations and includes embedded capabilities that make larger events a more attractive ROI for the business, in
our opinion. Additionally, we expect The Active Network to leverage existing IP, along with new innovations and acquired
technologies like Starcite, to succeed in altering its own architecture to accelerate new product introductions like Schwaggle,
over the next couple of years.
Increased confidence in a potential multibillion dollar trajectory. We came away from the investor meetings with the
impression management has its sights set on becoming a multibillion business. And we believe the business strategy
and  product  strategy  are  aligned  to  achieve  this  long-term  goal  since  The  Active  Network  has  mastered  the  art  of
event registration lifecycle management. Because The Active Network has harnessed more than 10 years of technology
development, it enjoys a lower long-term cost structure and faster rate of evolution of its technology, relative to other event
registration lifecycle management vendors, in our opinion. And given the fact that we think The Active Network is the 800-
lb gorilla in the space, we foresee strong pricing power and attractive cross selling opportunities in the future. We believe
this technological advantage, along with a dominant brand, sets the stage for an enduring business model that will grow
rapidly with high profit margins.

  Margin expansion thesis appears on track. Part of the ACTV bull thesis revolves around on-going margin expansion in
  the model. For the past two years EBITDA margins have grown ~200-300 bps annum and guidance assumes a similar
  300bps expansion, excluding acquisitions. Margins are likely to stay flat in 1H:2012 (vs. 2H: 2011) owing to higher integration
  costs and lower revenue recognized upfront from Starcite, but likely to accrete more meaningfully in 2H:2012 and 2013 from
  salesforce efficiency gains, lower R&D spend, and higher bookings, in our view.

  Multiple expansion potential. Since the Street is not currently valuing the business on Price/Sales, despite a highly,
  recurring revenue stream and SaaS industry leading retention rates, we believe consistent execution and further ActiveWorks
  adoption could expand the company's trading multiple. In contrast to older products, ActiveWorks is not a stand-alone point-
  product but a platform that could be used by other divisions within a business. Thus, the organic growth potential with existing
  customers is more attractive with ActiveWorks than the legacy solutions. One hurdle for revenue growth is migrating the
  customer to the new platform, which typically involves a more consultative engagement.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 19x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our $19 price target for ACTV shares is based on the same EV/EBITDA
multiple (i.e., 19x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $60M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the out year and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is below our 20% long-
term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 2.1x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50% discount to the current
SaaS companies' group average of 4.2x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is also based on 2.2x our EV/2013E
revenue estimate of $485M, as we use a similar valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV shares should continue to
trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue mix and lower gross margins
than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

Strong Technology Revenue Growth 
Contributes to Beat Quarter  

Active Network reported Q4 results at the higher end of guidance for Revenue 
and Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact from StarCite acquisition). Total 
revenue grew 23% Y/Y to $76.0MM vs. our $74.9MM and consensus 
$74.4MM. This was the companys third straight quarter with revenue growth 
above 20%. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of StarCite acquisition, 
came at $2.3MM ($400K including about $1.9MM in severance costs related to 
the StarCite acquisition) vs. our $2.4MM and consensus $2.4MM. GAAP net 
loss per share was ($0.16), above our ($0.23) and consensus ($0.22). 
Technology revenue was up 33% Y/Y to $65.5MM and Marketing Services 
revenue was down 15% Y/Y to $10.6MM 

Registrations in Q4 increased 13% Y/Y to 17.3MM bringing Net Registration 
revenue to $46.4MM. Average revenue per registration increased 4.6% Y/Y to 
$2.68. For 2011, registrations grew 14% Y/Y to 80.3MM with revenue per 
registration at $2.85. Some 51,300 organizations utilized Actives technology 
solutions, up 8% Y/Y. 

 

Guidance 

For 1Q12, Active Network guided for total revenue between $89MM and 
$93MM ($91MM at midpoint), above consensus $87.9MM. Adjusted EBITDA 
(including a $5MM impact from StarCite acquisition) is expected to be between 
negative $5MM and negative $3MM (negative $4MM at midpoint), below 
consensus $5.2MM. For FY12, Active expects total revenue between $425MM 
and $435MM ($430MM at midpoint), above consensus $409MM. Adjusted 
EBITDA is expected to be between $46MM and $50MM ($48MM at midpoint), 
below consensus $51MM. 

Although management explained on the call how purchase accounting affects 
their 2012 guidance, we believe it would be helpful to highlight here that the 
above guidance excludes about $14MM in deferred revenue (most of which 
flows right through to the bottom line) from Actives recent acquisitions (mostly 
StarCite). If the company were not subject to these accounting rules, revenue 
guidance for FY12 would have been close to $439MM-$449MM ($444MM at 
midpoint, up 32% Y/Y). Similarly, Adjusted EBITDA would have been about 
$60MM for a margin of about 13.5% (more than 200bps improvement Y/Y).

The Active Network, Inc.   24 February 2012 

 

Management Continues Executing on Strategy 
Active Network remains our small-cap top pick as we still believe the company 
is just beginning to realize the benefits of leverage built into its model. As our 
guidance clarification above has shown, if the company was not subject to 
purchase accounting rules on its recent acquisitions, 2012 guidance would have 
shown a very nice margin improvement over 2011. Management remains 
focused on execution and balancing strategic acquisitions with platform and 
product enhancements that attract and retain customers. As management shared 
on the call, back-end functionality (business automation) is the most sticky part 
of Actives offerings and where it invests about 90% of efforts and dollars. 
Other areas of focus include integration of products where strong synergies exist 
(StarCite), new product development (for outdoors, swimming, endurance), and 
mobile / social. In Q4 Active launched its mobile platform which allows 
customers to offer customized, branded iPhone and Android apps to consumers. 
With 19% of Active.com traffic in the quarter coming from mobile devices, the 
company plans to expand efforts in mobile.  

We believe the company is in the early stages of a material, long-term 
opportunity. By phasing off duplicate R&D spend for legacy systems and by 
migrating off-line registrations to online, Active is just beginning to realize the 
benefits of leverage built into its model. Currently, the North American market 
is penetrated approximately 6% and presents a significant growth opportunity. 
Similarly, international revenue is just about 3% of total revenue for Active 
Network and the company is in the early stages of building international 
presence  just opened its fourth international office in Sydney, Australia in Q4.

   Statement of Risk 

Risks include 1) integration of recent acquisitions and impact on margins, 2)

concerns include the failure to compete successfully against current or future 
competitors, failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, and 
inability to expand business outside North America. The company's failure to 
expand customers' use of its applications and to increase the percentage of 
participants who register through its website are two additional risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Events software vendor to offer meetings management capabilities combined

  Negatives
1) Marketing services revenue decreased 15% y/y in Q4 owing to a mix shift
in Q2/Q3; 2) PF gross margin declined 140bps sequentially to 60.7% owing to
timing of revenue recognition on larger marketing services deals; and 3) 2012
revenue guidance assumes faster growth with occur in the second half, partially
owing to deferred revenue recognition from Starcite.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 15x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our $19 price target for ACTV shares is based on the same EV/EBITDA
multiple (i.e., 15x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $60M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the out year and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is below our 20% long-
term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 1.7x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50% discount to the current
SaaS companies' group average of 4.2x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is also based on 1.9x our EV/2013E
revenue estimate of $485M, as we use a similar valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV shares should continue to
trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue mix and lower gross margins
than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

       Valuation 

       We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 and 2013 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x 
       revenue. We take an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our 
       coverage universe, and we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents analyst's best idea in the sector; expected to provide significant absolute total return over 12 months with a
favorable risk-reward ratio.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.

   Statement of Risk 

Risks include 1) integration of recent   acquisitions and impact on margins, 2) 
new business model and limited history of profitability, 3) difficulty attracting 
new customers and transitioning existing customers to ActiveWorks. Additional 
concerns include the failure to compete   successfully against current or future 
competitors, failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, and 
inability to expand business outside North America. The company's failure to 
expand customers' use of its applications and to increase the percentage of 
participants who register through its website are two additional risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rati ng. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

  appreciate the recurring nature of ACTV's revenue stream, in our opinion.    EPS is Non-GAAP
  We think ACTV's revenue model is more recurring in nature with better visibility
  than the Street assumes owing to, what we view as, a sticky customer base
  (~5% annual churn), great products, consistent organic registrations growth
  within the base, high customer satisfaction levels, and a large TAM that is
  lightly penetrated. These model characteristics are very similar to other SaaS
  companies in our coverage universe, which are typically valued on EV/Sales. A
  better appreciation of the underlying value of a highly visible, recurring revenue
  stream like The Active Network's could legitimize a higher valuation for the
  ACTV shares, in our opinion. Bottom line: The recurring nature of ACTV's
  revenue stream, along with solid secular trends, gives us conviction that
  The Active Network is going to be a much larger and more profitable
  company in the future and legitimizes a higher near-term valuation, in
  our opinion.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2012E EBITDA. Our new $19 (was $18) price target for ACTV shares is based on the
same EV/EBITDA multiple (i.e., 18x) applied to our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $56M. We roll over the valuation multiple to the
out year and believe this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple
is below our 20% long-term CAGR expectation. ACTV shares also trade at 2.2x EV/FTM estimated revenue, which is a 50%
discount to the current SaaS companies' group average of 4.4x. Our $19 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based
on 2.2x our EV/2013E revenue estimate of $480M, as we use the same valuation multiple in the out year. We think ACTV
shares should continue to trade at a discount to the SaaS group average on EV/Rev's owing to its higher services revenue
mix and lower gross margins than most SaaS vendors. We use a 50% multiple discount to the group average to reflect the
model differences.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

Price Target           $19.00      $18.00   sales hiring, indicate to us that demand for The ActiveWorks platform is escalating.
FY11 REV (M)         $334.3E                Additionally, we think the Street under appreciates the recurring nature of ACTV's
FY12 REV (M)         $424.7E                revenue stream despite having, what we view as, a very sticky customer-base with

                                               Solar Cost Update: Impact Of Technology Upgrades
ThinkClean Tech
                                               Approaching the 2012 construction season, we take a step back to consider costs in
                                               addition to price to ground ourselves after the recent rally in solar names. The apparent
                                               investor optimism evident to us in rising industry prices and positive sentiment for the
                                               equities of wafer, cell and module manufacturers lead us to look for reasons to come
                                               off our generally bearish near term view. But, given recent pricing checks and after
                                               revisiting our cost estimates, we continue to be cautious on manufacturing margins
                                               given our view of limited potential for cost savings and ongoing rationalization of prices.
                                               We return to our positive recommendation for equipment suppliers as the industry
                                               moves production to 19% efficient cells from the current 16.5%.

ACTV: Going Deep and Wide With Starcite

THINK ACTION:
We  like  the  potential  synergies  of  the  Starcite  acquisition  and  believe  the                  Brian Schwartz
acquisition  will  ultimately  accelerate  the  company's  organic  growth  and  add415-249-1982, bschwartz@thinkequity.com
scale to the business, while driving demand for the business segment. We've
known Starcite for years and consider it a market leader in SaaS-based meetingsChanges            Current    Previous

KEY POINTS:
Last Friday, The Active Network held an investor call to discuss the recent    52-Week High:                   $19.99
acquisition of Starcite. Below are deal metrics and our viewpoint:             52-Week Low:                    $12.30
                                                                               Shares O/S-Diluted (M):            62.8

Deal Terms Are at a Reasonable Valuation, in our view
                                                                               Average Daily Volume:          223,529
  The Active Network acquired Starcite for ~$58M ($40M in cash/ 1.35M shares).
                                                                               Short Interest:                   2.0%
  On a 2012 pro forma basis, Starcite was estimated to generate ~$47M in       Debt/Total Cap:                   0.0%
  revenue and $6M in EBITDA.                                                   Net Cash Per Share:               $2.20
                                                                               P/E (12-month forward):             NA
  Reasonable 2012 Transaction Multiples: ~1.2x EV/Rev's and ~9.7x EV/          Est. Long-Term EPS Growth:       35.0%
  EBITDA compared to ACTV's multiples of ~1.9x and ~13x, respectively.         P/E/G:                             NM
Key Positives of the Starcite Acquisition                                      Fiscal Year-End:                   Dec
  Our field checks suggest Starcite's business had reaccelerated over the past REV (M)  $    2010A    2011E     2012E
  couple of quarters with ~20% increase in the number of 2011 RFPs.            Mar           63.2A     72.7A     90.4E

  Creates numerous cross-selling opportunities for ACTV products into
  Starcite's customer base and selling Starcite's products into The Active
  Network customers.

Potential Risks of the Starcite Acquisition
  This is the largest acquisition since its IPO for The Active Network which by
  nature will carry risks.
  ACTV could lose focus on its other three core operating segments in favor of,
  what we view as, the faster growing business segment.
  Starcite had many customers that are subscription based and thus The
  Active Network will need to come up with a strategy to successfully migrate
  Starcite's customers over to ACTV's mostly transaction-based model.

  2012 Model Changes

We have added ~$36M in revenue and reduced our PF EPS by $0.02.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 21x EV/EBITDA
multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $47M. We assume ACTV maintains a slightly higher valuation multiple and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is similar to our 20%
long-term CAGR expectation.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

In   selecting   our   2012   "Fab   Four",   ACTV,   KNXA,   LPSN,   &   ULTI   scored
exceptionally well in five critical areas: SaaS business model, horizontal solutions,
high  scarcity  value,  Enterprise-wide  deployments  and  a  cost-savings  value
proposition. On an application segment basis, we remain most bullish on the
Talent Management sector owing to its strong secular and cyclical trends and top
segment rank scoring among our five critical areas.

KEY POINTS:
In choosing our "Fab Four" ideas for 2012, we evaluated a dozen small, mid and
large cap Enterprise software companies that we follow in the following five critical
areas and selected companies that we viewed as strong in all five categories:
Company-specific secular trends and brief snapshots are located on page 2.
1. SaaS  business  model.  We  are  seeing  a  monumental  shift  occurring  in
Enterprise  Software  as  CIOs  transition  from  legacy,  client  server  software
infrastructure  to  SaaS  platforms.  Although  many  Enterprises  are  still  buying
software in the traditional, on-premise format, we prefer the predictability, stability,
and faster innovation cycles of the SaaS business model.
2.  Horizontal  solutions.  The  ability  to  sell  to  almost  any  size  organization
or industry vertical with little to no customization makes it easier to add new
customers and provides diversification from vertical slowdowns (i.e., such as the
current Housing industry is experiencing). This can also lead to higher operating
margins from lower C.O.G.S. and R&D requirements.
3. High scarcity value. With organic growth rates slowing among most of the
largest Enterprise software companies, it is logical to assume an organic growth
challenged large software vendor will attempt to identify a unique technology
asset and consider acquiring them as one of their eventual options.
4. Enterprise-wide deployments. Solutions that are adopted by every employee
increases  stickiness,  demonstrates  scale,  and  should  provide  better  data
analytics capabilities for the Enterprise than solutions sold solely into divisions. In
our view, pervasive usage makes a more compelling case for CIOs to standardize
on an Enterprise-wide platform and procure additional solutions over time from
this type of vendor than a divisional platform. This is not to say that companies
can not generate strong growth simply by selling into divisions. Years ago, who
would have ever envisioned salesforce.com becoming a $15B company simply by
selling salesforce automation software to the sales and marketing departments.
However, if divisional solutions never gain adoption Enterprise-wide than they
lack a compelling case around data integration and analytics, in our opinion.
Additionally, vendors solely selling into divisions will likely eventually succumb to
market saturation and risk a slow descent in their new business growth rates as
available runway shrinks.
5. Cost savings value proposition. Though we have no call on the global
macro outlook, clearly there are heightened concerns around slowing growth
rates among the BRIC economies and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We
recently experienced elements of a more cautious IT buyer and elongated sales
cycles in our November/December field checks, and from recent new business
results from industry bellwethers such as Oracle and salesforce.com. In a slowing
macro environment the IT buyer tends to be more focused on a quick ROI. And
we believe it is easier to validate a quick ROI with a cost-savings solution than a
demand generation solution, in most cases. Thus winning new business with a
demand generation value proposition tends to be more vulnerable to customer
business cycles in this type of macro backdrop, in our opinion.

KEY COMPANY-SPECIFIC SECULAR TRENDS

ACTV: SaaS-based online registrations lifecycle management platform is imperative in our view for events management
organizations  to  increase  participation  rates  and  enhance  customer  service;  shift  from  offline  to  online  registrations,
transactions and advertisement

KNXA: Skilled labor shortages; higher employee attrition; automating and outsourcing HR department requirements

LPSN: Real-time customer behavioral analysis are essential in our view for effective online selling and customer support

ULTI: SaaS payroll is starting to tip into the Enterprise market = larger deal sizes & improved revenue visibility; automating
HR department requirements

                                                                                                 Industry Report

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGETS

ACTV: Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 18x EV/
EBITDA multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $54M. We assume ACTV maintains a similar valuation multiple and believe
this multiple is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is in the middle of
our 15-20% long-term CAGR expectation.

KNXA: At approximately 14x our EV/FTM OCF estimate of $43M, we believe KNXA is one of the more attractively valued
stocks in our SaaS software universe. On an EV/2012E revenue basis, KNXA shares trade at just 2.1x versus the SaaS
companies group average of 4.3x. The stock also trades at a noticeable discount to the 2.9x group average on an EV/2012E
revenue basis for our Non-SaaS application companies. Our $32 price target is based on our assumption that the shares will
trade at 2.4x EV/2012E revenue, which we think is appropriate, as it is a noticeable discount to the SaaS group average. We
think KNXA shares should continue to trade at a discount to the SaaS group average owing to its higher services revenue mix
than most SaaS vendors. However, we don't think the shares should trade at a discount to the Non-SaaS group average due
to the higher visibility of its subscription model and faster organic revenue growth, cash flow growth and EPS growth than the
Non- SaaS group average, but we use a slight discount group average multiple to the Non-SaaS group to be conservative.

LPSN: Currently, LPSN shares trade at approximately 21x our EV/FTM cash from operations estimate of $29M, which is below
the entire SaaS group average of 27x. Our $14 per-share price target for LPSN shares is based on 23x our EV/2012 cash from
operations estimate of $31M, as we assume that LPSN will maintain essentially a similar valuation multiple in the out year and
we believe this multiple to be appropriate and conservative since we think that LPSN shares warrant at least a group average
multiple because of what we believe is LivePerson's leading market positioning in the Customer Intelligent Engagement market
and higher profitability profile than most other SaaS providers.

ULTI: ULTI currently trades at 5.3x our EV/FTM Rev estimate of $312M, which is a premium to the current SaaS Group average
of 4.3x. Our valuation analysis yields a $63 per-share price target for ULTI shares, which is based on 5.1x 2012E EV/ Rev. We
assume ULTI will maintain a slightly more conservative valuation multiple in the out-year and believe this multiple is appropriate
since historically ULTI trades at ~5x Ev/Rev.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGETS

ACTV: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4) failure to demonstrate
leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

KNXA: 1) Prolonged weakness in IT spending; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increase in customer churn; 4) slow customer
adoption of talent management software; 5) rising unemployment; 6) acquisition integration challenges; 7) competition.

LPSN: 1) Competition. The above-average industry growth and increasing strategic value of customer intelligent solutions
could attract the attention of larger software players. These larger software companies could then leverage the scale of their
business, and size of their customer bases, to price competing solutions aggressively; which could make new customer
additions and growth more challenging for LivePerson. 2) Macroeconomic fluctuations. LivePerson, like most other software
companies, are exposed to changes in customer demand caused by macro fluctuations such as a recession. Any significant
downturn in the economy most likely would result in a tightening of corporate IT budgets that could cause customers to defer
investing in customer intelligent solutions. 3) Increased churn. SaaS companies are focused on customer renewals to sustain
the business models. If renewals dip below historical levels, growth will become more of a challenge. 4) Legal Risk. The
company is currently involved in two patent infringement litigation suits. While we can not predict the ultimate outcome of
any legal proceedings, the suits could cause new customers from deferring purchases of LivePerson or existing customers
canceling service as a result of these cases. Additionally, there could be monetary damages that could have an adverse effect
on the companys financial position. The company has not accrued any monies for these cases as they believe the cases are
without merit and any amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Broadband Mobility and                        2012
Communications Infrastructure
                                              While we have no call on the global macro outlook, we see Broadband Mobility as a
                                              major theme in 2012 with several major disruptors and technology upgrades on the way.
                                              Specifically, we believe 1) 4G/LTE will come to mass market smart phones and tablets
                                              in 2H12 and drive new infrastructure shifts including carrier WiFi, small cells, and IP
                                              adaptive traffic management, 2) we believe Windows8 on ARM will offer low-cost/high
                                              performance/longer battery life as mobile technologies penetrate the PC market from
                                              the bottom-up, 3) Apple will disrupt the TV industry with its iTV, and 4) lower cost access
                                              solutions will bring broadband to the "have nots" in developed and developing regions.

Infrastructure Software
                                               We expect the security group to have an especially strong year on fundamentals
                                               in 2012, with solid demand (e.g. revenue growth of 12%, 2-3x the rate of global IT
                                               spending growth) and product news in firewall, intrusion prevention, encryption, and
                                               data protection. Key underlying trends in IT which are driving demand for security
                                               should continue to be virtualization in the data center, cloud adoption, managed service
                                               adoption, and the nightly news. We regard newsflow, apart from product introductions
                                               and potential IPOs, as a regular catalyst for the security group. While unfortunate,
                                               network-driven attacks on institutions and brands, denial of service extortion, data theft
                                               and cyber-warfare are part of the new normal of online communication, commerce and
                                               social dependency.

  Call  option  on  platform  play.  The  Active  Network  is  in  the  process  of
  transitioning its customer base onto a single platform called ActiveWorks. This
  transition should take 18-24 months to complete and ACTV's R&D expense
  and C.O.G.S. will be temporarily elevated as they end-of-life legacy platforms.
  Once  completed,  ACTV  will  operate  a  leaner  cost  structure  that  should
  provide leverage on future revenue growth, which we view as an attractive
  investment trait. Also, having one platform allows The Active Network to speed
  up innovation and deliver the latest functionality, which greatly enhances the
  number of new product cycles, increases customer stickiness, and puts The
  Active Network at the forefront of the industry's technology leaders, in our
  opinion.

VALUATION:
Currently, ACTV shares trade 18x EV/2011E EBITDA. Our $18 price target for ACTV shares is based on a 18x EV/EBITDA
multiple applied to our 2012 estimate of $54M. We assume ACTV maintains a similar valuation multiple and believe this multiple
is appropriate since the business has a highly predictable revenue stream and the multiple is in the middle of our 15-20%
long-term CAGR expectation.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Risks to our price target include: 1) acquisition integration challenges; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) increased churn; 4)
failure to demonstrate leverage to R&D spend; and 5) failure to expand into other verticals and geographies.

Investment Thesis 

Market Leader in a $10B+ SaaS Space 
 
Active Network is the market leader in  online events registration services  a 
$10B opportunity in North America only  which is highly fragmented and 
under-penetrated (Active is serving ~4% and ~6% of addressable registrations 
and organizations, respectively). The company has built strong competitive 
moats based on scale (handling 70MM+ registrations / year for 47K+ 
customers), technology (900+ R&D staff),  and deep domain expertise (10+ 
years of experience). Currently, it faces very limited competition  mostly 
from niche players with a few legacy relationships in their immediate vicinity.

Active Network enjoys a sizeable recurring revenue stream (about 85% of 
total revenue comes from exclusive multi-year contracts) and a large and 
diversified customer base. In addition, less than 5% annual revenue churn 
contributes significantly to the recurring nature of registration revenues and 
overall high revenue visibility. The companys model also benefits from built-
in leverage that starts to kick in as Active phases off duplicate R&D spend for 
legacy systems and off-line registrations migrate to online. 

Active Network has managed to build some very engaging Internet properties 
around the events it helps organize. The company is also investing in products 
with social / mobile / global capabilities as these tend to drive higher 
engagement, participation, and registrants. Social features such as user 
communities help create a loyal audience and drive higher traffic growth 
(unique visitors and total visits to Active websites increased 40%+ Y/Y in 
each of the past 9 months). A loyal audi ence and solid traffic, in turn, attract 
more organizers to Actives properties and create a virtuous network effect 
cycle. 

We are initiating coverage of Active Network with a Buy rating and $22 price 
target. We believe our estimates could prove conservative as Active continues 
to migrate existing customers to ActiveWorks  its technology platform.

Large and Fragmented Addressable Market 

While Active Network may be best-known for the registration of endurance 
events, including triathlons and marathons, on its Active.com website, its robust 
SaaS-based technology platform serves a much larger, highly fragmented market. 
The companys customers can be categorized into 20 key verticals forming four 
main groups (each contributing $50MM+ a year).  

Table 1: Active Network Customer Verticals 

Sports                             Community Activities                 Outdoors                           Business Events

Actives total addressable market (TAM) is so large that it is almost difficult to 
conceptualize. According to the company, each year more than 800,000 
organizations in North America solicit and process more than 1.7B registrations 
for sports, outdoors, community, or business events.

Active Network works with over 47,000 of these organizations, processing more 
than 70MM registrations a year for them. This represents just 4%-6% market 
penetration and highlights the size of the untapped opportunity. In addition, 
while less than five percent of revenue is currently from international sources, 
we believe that market characteristics abroad are similar, and thus present a 
significant opportunity for Active Network. 

Chart 1: North America Event Registrations Market Penetration (2010) 

Source: Company reports, UBS 

 

Based on management estimates, the 1.7B annual event registrations generate 
more than $110B in activity fees. This translates into about $10B TAM in North 
America (based on an average 9% technology fee assumption). For comparison, 
Active Network generated $238MM in technology revenue in 2010, which 
represents roughly 2% market share. Following its recent IPO, Active Network 
has very strong balance sheet with over $139MM in cash, enabling the company 
to scale its business and to execute its growth plan and profitability goals. 

Active Network continues to expand its presence into other areas, including 
winter sports and the faith-based market, where it recently acquired Resort 
Technology Partners (RTP) and Fellowship Technologies, respectively. Post this 
acquisition, the Active Network platforms now serve over 3,500 churches and a 
number of popular ski resorts to sell tickets, activities, and manage rentals. 
RTP's systems are currently implemented by Aspen Skiing Company, Intrawest, 
Powdr Corp., SkiStar, Vail Resorts, and VERBIERStBernard, among others. 
Churches are not much different from other organizations (in terms of event and 
community management) and have the same set of needs as many of the other 
organizations Active currently serves. The companys comprehensive suite of 
solutions gives church organizers the tools to leverage their resources and best 
serve the people in their communities with the goal of growing revenues and 
operating more efficiently. We believe   that opportunities for growth in each 
vertical, as well as in new segments, are very substantial.

In addition, the SaaS space as a whole exhibits several characteristics that make 
it very attractive: 

      SaaS: a major platform shift      SaaS, as applied to business software, 
      represents a major transition in the IT landscape. Its significance rivals past 
      transitions, such as from mainframe computing to minicomputers, and from 
      minis to client / server computing. As                                        with most major IT transitions, we 
      expect the SaaS trend to last 10+ years. 

      SaaS: fastest growing segment of enterprise software         According to 
      Gartner Inc. data, revenue from SaaS-bas ed enterprise applications software 
      is forecast to grow at a 5-year C                                  AGR (2008-13) of 17.7%  significantly 
      outpacing the overall enterprise apps software market growth of 3.6%. 
      Penetration of SaaS within overall ente                                        rprise apps software is expected to 
      nearly double from 7% in 2008 ($6.4B out of $90.6B total) to 13% by 2013 
      ($14.4B out of $108.3B total).

Low Online Penetration 

Over the years, the manual (paper-based or spreadsheet-based) approach to 
event registrations has been gradually replaced by more sophisticated, organizer-
hosted custom applications and increasingly by tailored online applications 
running on platforms such as ActiveWorks  Active Networks organization-
centric cloud computing platform, which has transformed the way organizers 
manage, market, record, track, and share information about activities and events. 
Prior to using SaaS solutions, organizers had limited means to improve 
productivity. There was a clear lack of high quality products that addressed this 
fragmented market. Active Network developed a superior technology platform 
with deep domain expertise, which helped the company embed into the 
operational fabric of its customer base.

Leading Technology Platform with High 
Competitive Barriers to Entry 
Since the beginning of 2011, Active has managed over $1.7B in gross 
registration fees through its proprietary cloud-based SaaS platform. The 
ActiveWorks platform architecture allows  it to efficiently provide vertically-
specialized, flexible and scalable applications to a large and diverse market.  

Active Network's biggest competitor today is pen and paper. For example, if a 
person wants to reserve a campsite, the state park will likely book the spot by 
writing down their information in a reservation book. Beyond pen and paper, 
Active is the largest company in the sp ace. The strength of its business lies in 
the core of its technology. Active has leveraged its key horizontal applications 
with the necessary vertical specific f eatures and functionality, allowing for 
broader reach and movement into adjacent market opportunities. The company 
developed a platform that addresses both sides of the market  the organizer and 
the customer. It has partnered with orga nizers to gain exclusive access to their 
activity inventory with SaaS applications and it has built the largest online 
communities dedicated to active participants (Active owns and operates the 
leading online communities for activity     participants such as Active.com, 
ReserveAmerica.com and LaxPower.com). These communities have been built 
as a by-product of SaaS systems and many activity organizers work to get access 
to Actives audience. The companys position in both markets is self-reinforcing, 
therefore, creating a network effect. 

While there are a number of smaller competitors, they are mostly regional 
players that not only have a limited range   of services but also  lack the scale, 
technology, and vertical expertise of Active Network. The company has a loyal 
customer base, with less than 5% annual registration revenue churn. Active 
Network is the leader in each of its major verticals and management believes 
that, overall, Active generates over 5x the revenue of its next largest competitor 
 Cvent, which operates in only one of Actives verticals, business events. With 
mostly niche players having few legacy relationships in their immediate vicinity, 

                                                                                                                   UBS 7

competition in online events registration is very fragmented and in our view 
poses no immediate threat to Actives competitive market positioning. 

 

High Revenue Visibility / Predictable Recurring 
Revenue 

About 85% of Active Networks revenue base consists of technology revenue 
composed of net registration and software revenue. Net registration revenue 
(~70% of total) is generated when a participant (in a customers event) 
completes a registration and pays the regi  stration fee (typical ly using a credit 
card). Once the credit card transaction is processed, Active receives the full 
payment (less processing fees) and retains ~$2 per registration + 6.5% of the net 
registration fee paid by the participant. The remainder is remitted (in about two 
weeks) to the customer organization. Software revenue (~15% of total) includes 
revenue from software licensing, hosting, maintenance, and implementation fees, 
with the majority of it related to legacy systems from acquired companies. As 
Active continues to migrate existing customers to ActiveWorks, software 
revenue is expected to decline as a percentage of technology (and total) revenue. 

Technology revenue comes from exclusive, multi-year contracts (usually 3-year 
agreements) and gives management very good visibility into revenue levels over 
a forward 9-12 month time frame. Historical annual revenue churn has been 
relatively low  less than 5%  and contributes largely to the recurring nature of 
revenue. In addition, the companys customer base is big (more than 47,000 
organizations) and diversified, helping further increase visibility and recurrence 
of revenue streams.

While Active Networks revenue currently exhibits pronounced seasonal 
patterns (with Q2 being the busiest quarter and Q4 the slowest), expansion into 
winter sports with the acquisition of  RTP represents an opportunity to smooth 
out seasonality. Expansion into other verticals and growth of marketing services 
can soften this seasonality even more.

Model with Built-in Leverage 

As a result of more than 25 acquisitions over the past 5 years, Active Network 
has accumulated more than a few customer s that license legacy systems for all 
or part of their needs. Since Active is contractually obligated to support these 
legacy systems, it effectively duplicates its R&D (supporting both ActiveWorks 
and licensed software). In 2010, the company spent roughly 60% of R&D on its 
new platform and 40% on legacy systems. While the company has been actively 
transitioning customers to ActiveWorks (where possible), management 
estimates that the migration to the new platform will require an additional 3-4 
years to complete. Once this process concludes, Actives annual R&D spend 
will be reduced noticeably, resulting in margin improvement of roughly 400bps 
over a period of 4 years.

Another built-in leverage in Actives model kicks in as off-line registrations 
move online. This is particularly true for the outdoors segment where the 
company maintains call centers for campground registrations and shares revenue 
with merchants such as Wal-Mart, REI, or Dicks Sporting Goods where 
hunting & fishing licenses are purchased at a kiosk or POS terminal. Once the 
migration to the online channel (accounting in 2010 for only ~9% of hunting & 
fishing license / permit issues and ~54% of campground registrations) 
accelerates, Active Network should expe                       rience a noticeable improvement in 
margins. This shift from off-line to online, however, is not happening very fast  
only about 2%-4% of Actives business tr  ansitions each year  but we expect 
acceleration over time.  We anticipate the potential for a significant tipping point 
to occur when online share eclipses 20%. 

 

Network Effect Driven by Compelling 
Community / Social Features 

Active Network websites community and                             social features attract increasing 
numbers of event participants who come  to share their experiences and keep in 
touch with fellow participants and event organizers. This attracts more event 
organizers to Actives platform which in turn drives more users to engage with 
their events, building a virtuous cycle that helps the company create value for 
participants and event organizers, thus attracting more customers and registrants.

Total visits have been growing strong too, with Y/Y growth rates in excess of 
40% over the past 10 months. Similarly, total time spent on Active.com sites 
shows consistently high growth rates since early 2011. In our view, this is due to 
increased engagement on the side of event participants who stay longer and 
return more often to the user communities on Actives properties to keep in 
touch with other participants and the organizers of their favorite events. Such

The company is also expanding its reach      and distribution channels rapidly. 
Mobile traffic accounts for ~18% of total Active.com traffic (up from ~15% just 
a couple of months ago). Social fa  ns (Facebook and Twitter) already exceed 
1MM (up 105% Y/Y) and affiliate partners contribute more than 17MM visits 
per month. Active Network is growing its ecosystem actively, as social 
integration and sharing are primary driver s of traffic growth and conversion. In 
addition, Actives Web properties are very complementary to its technology 
services and a major source of activity registrations (for example, 35%-40% of 
endurance sports registrations originate on Active.com). 

 

Secular Growth in Online Advertising 

While currently, marketing services revenue is only ~15% of total revenue, it 
has the potential to deliver significant upside to our estimated growth for the 
segment as ad dollars continue shifting from off-line to online in an effort to 
catch up with changing content consumption trends. Additional growth can also 
come from increased advertising budgets once the macro environment improves 
and advertisers return to their normal ad spend levels. Marketing services 
revenue consists of online and integrated field marketing campaigns. According 
to management, the total is roughl    y equally split between commerce and 
advertising revenue. Online marketing services include online advertising, e-
mail marketing and targeted newsletter promotions. Field marketing services 
include event promotions, sponsorship     s, and sample placements, defined 
contractually with individual customers. A major marketing services customer 
of Active Network is ESPN  accounting for approximately 17% of marketing 
services revenue at current run rates (still only about 2% of total net revenue). 
We expect to see more advertisers showing up on Actives web properties as 
social features such as user communitie s and new investments in products with

social / mobile / global capabilities start driving higher engagement,

virtuous cycle that reinforces the growth of a loyal audience and event 
organizers selecting Active Network as a service provider.

Major Growth Drivers 

Adding more organizations in existing markets. This increases the number of 
registrations that utilize Actives technol  ogy solutions. In its first and most 
mature customer vertical, triathlons, Actives built a customer base of over 70% 
of all events in the market. This compares to Actives overall business with 6% 
of the addressable North American mark et. We estimate that the other 94% of 
the market is still using traditional pen and paper methods or generally much 
less sophisticated automation tools. Actives long-term goal is to have all 
verticals replicate the success made in penetrating triathlons. 

Increasing online conversion rates. The company is working to get more of its 
existing customers participants to sign up online using Actives digital 
technology, rather than using traditi onal analog methods (such as calling, 
mailing in paper forms, or walking up to register for an activity). Actives 
leading technology platfo  rm and proven ROI is driving a transition to 
automation in the activity and events space  similar to the transition seen in the 
restaurant and travel space. 

Deepening relationships with existing customers, driving more participants to 
events, and more participants online, while also broadening product offerings. 

Acquisitions. We expect Active to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to 
drive growth. To date, the company has a very successful track record of 
acquiring and integrating companies. We expect Active to look for strategic fits 
to enter into new markets, expand its technology footprint, and to acquire new 
customers.  

International expansion. While Actives international business is still small, 
representing less than 5% of total revenue, international revenue increased by 
over 50% in the first half of 2011. We believe that international markets have 
the same fragmented characteristics, no cl ear market leader and a similar sized 
market opportunity as North America. We expect Active to expand its offerings 
to address this significant market opportunity. 

Recent launch of online affiliate program , which distributes comprehensive 
directory of activities and events. 

    •   Allows online marketers and publishers to earn revenue by directing 
        consumers to register for activities on Active.com, while also increasing 
        audience reach. 

    •   Value proposition for the affiliate is they obtain compelling local 
        content, in addition to added revenue via Actives affiliate offering. 

    •   Value proposition for event customers is they can dramatically expand 
        their reach just by using Actives software. 

    •   Platform affiliates include espnW, ESPN's content and digital business 
        initiative for women, a new collaboration exemplifying Actives 
        versatility and the impact that Active.com has on consumers who are a 
        natural audience for its products and services.

Another long-term initiative that could drive growth is the launch of a 
comprehensive lead generation program, Schwaggle; an e-commerce offering 
that can help to leverage Actives a  udience to drive demand for events and 
activities, again reinforcing why organizers benefit from using Actives software 
solutions. 

This program includes exclusive deals on fitness-related products and services 
for the Active consumer. It is one of the first programs to distribute offers 
through both email and Facebook, demonstrating how Active works closely with 
customers to innovate and strengthen connections with Actives consumers.

The Active Network, Inc.   5 December 2011 

Risk Analysis 

Integration of Recent Acquisitions 
Over the past five years, Active Network has acquired more than 25 companies, 
and five of those were strategic acquisitions that helped it expand into new 
markets or build competitive moats. As Active grows larger and more complex, 
we believe that it will become increasingly difficult to integrate new businesses. 
In addition, expansion into new verticals can impact margins negatively due to 
the inherent characteristics of the new bus iness and has been the cause of some 
lumpiness in revenue per registration in the past. For example, revenue per 
registration and average margins declin ed noticeably following the acquisition 
of ReserveAmerica (the US #1 campground reservations provider) in 2009. 
Campground revenue is inherently much lower per user than, for example, 
hunting or fishing registration revenue. Campground revenue is also largely the 
same online vs. off-line but Active has to maintain call centers that put pressure 
on COGS and contribute to a break-even margin for the vertical overall.  

Another example of a possible negative impact on Actives business model 
comes from the acquisition of Automated License Systems (the US #1 hunting 
& fishing license and permit technology provider) in 2008. Revenue per 
registration in this vertical is ~$3 online, but off-line, it is as low as $0.90 when 
users go to a bait & tackle store or a retailer such as Wal-Mart, REI, or Dicks 
Sporting Goods and purchase the license from a POS terminal or kiosk. While 
outdoors is the only segment where Active collects revenue both off-line and 
online, it represents about 40MM of the total 70MM registrations for 2010. Most 
recently in 3Q11, the company saw a 15% Y/Y increase in registrations (after 
the implementation of two state contracts, Ohio and California) but revenue per 
registration increased just 2% Y/Y (down 15% sequentially) and well below the 
average increase of 6% Y/Y for the prior six quarters. 

While the revenue mix each quarter will continue to impact average revenue per 
registration and result in some lumpiness, we believe that over time the quarterly 
variability will decline and overall revenue per registration will trend up as 
customers (in the outdoors segment) migrate online. We project a CAGR of 
~12% for the number of registrations and ~4% for average revenue per 
registration from 2011 to 2015.

Inability to Transition Existing Customers to 
ActiveWorks Platform 
Active Network serves a wide range of customers and the majority of them are 
already on ActiveWorks  the companys technology platform  at varying 
levels of integration. The company is  also transitioning to ActiveWorks certain 
customers that are currently using both internally developed and acquired legacy 
systems. The transition process is time-consuming and requires investment in 
personnel and technology. Active Network evaluates the level of sophistication 
and compatibility with its internal systems to determine whether to integrate into 
ActiveWorks (expanding the platform capabilities) or migrate customers to 
ActiveWorks (replacing the legacy system with an alternative internal system). 
Retaining customers, especially in new verticals, thus often requires maintaining 
multiple legacy systems during the transition period and integrating some legacy 
systems into ActiveWorks at additional costs. Extended transition periods or 
inability to transition new and existing customers to ActiveWorks can result in 
material costs. Additionally, the bulk of operating margin improvement (and 
long-term management guidance) assumes a comprehensive integration of the 
acquired technology, a process that management estimates could take about 2-3 
years. Still, the recent appointment of  20-year global technology veteran Darko 
Dejanovic as Chief Technology, Product and Innovation Officer should help the 
company accelerate this process. Mr. Dejanovic has extensive expertise in 
growing global B2B and B2C technology and online media companies, which 
should be instrumental in advancing Active Networks technological innovation 
and growth. 

 

New Business Model and Limited History of Profitability 
Since its inception in 1998, Active Network has had only one (2Q11) profitable 
quarter. In addition, it has made various changes to its platform and offerings 
over time and as a result has a very limited operating history with its current 
business model. Although execution by management has been very strong, we 
think some risk of disruption in the business model remains. While Actives 
relations with existing customers tend to be strong, its business model is easily 
replicable. Established technology companies in the SaaS enterprise software 
space (Salesforce.com, Blackboard) and  companies in the event ticketing space 
(LiveNation) are a handful of possible competitors. However, we believe this 
possibility is remote, as the time and cost to build a customer base that supports 
a profitable business model are not immaterial (Active has 10+ years of 
experience and a solid customer base of 47,000+ organizations in the US). 

In terms of profitability, Active Network already generates positive FCF (on an 
annual basis) but its first positive net income quarter was 2Q11. We expect 
continuing losses in the near term and GAAP net income profitability (on an 
annual basis) in 2012.

Organizers Bringing Registrations In-House 

While we believe this is currently remote, the possibility that some event 
organizers may decide to bring their registrations in-house (rather than pay a 
6.5% processing fee) remains a threat to the companys business model. 
Generally, Actives contracts for technology services are exclusive 3-year 
agreements and customers tend to be very sticky. In addition, currently, no 
single customer contributes more than 5% of total revenue and the eventual loss 
of a big one should not have an unmanageable impact on the company. 

 

Deterioration of State / Municipal Budgets and Tough 
Government Agency Customers Requirements 

Continued state and municipal fiscal problems can have a negative impact on 
Actives business if they result in the closing of state / municipal parks and 
facilities serviced by the company. According to management, closures so far 
(particularly in California) have affected only non-revenue producing properties 
but continued budget deterioration can change this rapidly. In addition, many 
government agency customers impose add  itional requirements such as custom 
application features and service requirements (e.g. live call centers in certain 
states) that incur additional costs and can  negatively impact margin expansion. 
While a lot of Actives solutions actually generate revenue for the states, 
continued state and local budgetary pressure could have an impact if revenue-
generating state sites are closed. 

 

Limited Exposure to International Markets 

Currently, only a small fraction of Active Networks revenue comes from 
international sources. For 3Q11, the company reported just $2.8MM in 
international sales (almost $8MM for the first three quarters of the year), or 
about 3% of total. While this revenue stream grows faster than Actives 
domestic revenues (per management, 75% CAGR for 2005-2010), having 97% 
exposure to a single geographic area leaves the company overly dependent on 
North America. Whereas the company ini  tially just followed some of its large 

                                                                                                                                                                                                  UBS 20

Forthcoming Catalysts 
There are just a few events in the near to mid-term which we believe could 
become a catalyst for the stock. Among them is the companys 4Q CY2011 
earnings call expected in the second week of February 2012. In the meantime, 
any announcement of a major contract win, update on the progress of recent 
acquisitions integration (especially Resort Technology Partners and Fellowship 
Technologies), and news of successful transition of customers to ActiveWorks 
can act as a catalyst for the stock.

Active Network signs contracts with organizations to provide them with event 
and group management solutions that enable participants to register for their 
activity. The company generates revenue from technology fees paid by 
participants who register through Actives cloud computing applications for 
activities organized by Active Network customers. The technology fee is a 
percentage of the total registration amount paid by a participant at the time of 
sign-up. The consumer is charged the total event registration fee, including the 
technology fee. Technology fees are referred to as net registration revenue, since 
they are the direct result of participant registrations.  

Active Network has pursued a growth strategy focused on growing the number 
of customers it serves and increasing participant usage of online registration 
services by training customers in the execution of conversion techniques. The 
company plans to deepen its relationships with existing customers, pursue 
strategic acquisitions to strengthen market position, and expand internationally.

Environmental, Social, and 
Governance Issues 

Table 11: UBS Proprietary ESG Sector Questionnaire 

Key Questions                                            Issues 

The most important core drivers                          New customers, number of registrations, % of registrations completed online, revenue per 
                                                         registration. 
The most important financial metrics                     Revenue growth, segment revenue growth, operating costs. 

The most important environmental or social issues that could      Attempts to disrupt services or obtain sensitive information could impact online registrations growth, 
affect 1 and 2?                                          which is a key driver of financial performance. The overall level of event registrations could be 
                                                         impacted by adverse macro-economic conditions in the US and abroad. 
                                                          
The most important governance issues that could affect 1 and 2    Unsuitable acquisitions could hurt margins / profitability and distract management. 

The greatest opportunities and risks (business as usual) for firms   Opportunities exist in expanding into new verticals, increasing penetration into existing ones, and 
in the industry?                                         driving more registrations from the off-line to t he online channel. The greatest risks are competition 
                                                         and effective cost controls. 

Potential environmental, social, or governance catalysts  Interruption in services as a result of natural disasters or power outages, diminished reputation 
                                                         because of privacy/information concerns, continued macro-economic headwinds.

Overall, we believe the environmental  and social risks for Active Network are 
very low. In our view, the primary social risk is a potential hacking to disrupt 
services or illicitly obtain private data. While they have been diminished lately, 
we have seen instances of corporate websites taken down by hackers, typically 
using relatively simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. In most 
prior attacks, the websites and services were restored quickly (Sony is an 
exception), with no lasting effects on operations. Should Active Network fail to 
protect member privacy and prevent service disruptions, it could face legal 
implications and lose the confidence of both customer organizations and event 
participants. 

While it is minimal, as the company does not consume significant resources, the 
principal environmental issue related to Active Network is the consumption of 
electricity necessary to support its IT infrastructure. Actives dependence on 
energy to power its servers is also a pot ential risk if any type of outage occurs 
and disrupts the availability of its services/websites for its users. The company 
does not disclose any information re        lating to its CO2 emissions. Recently, 
activist shareholders of Amazon have voiced concerns over the companys 
consumption of raw materials and energy and insisted that it make public the 
environmental impact of its operations. However, these issues have had no 
implications for Amazon and we believe the risk to Active Network 
shareholders is also very low.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rati ng. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
 Forecast Stock Return (FSR) is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield over the next 12 
months. 
 Market Return Assumption (MRA) is defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a 
forecast of, the equity risk premium). 
 Under Review (UR) Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are 
subject to possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. 
 Short-Term Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any 
change in the fundamental view or investment case. 
Equity Price Targets have an investment horizon of 12 months. 
 
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES 
UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy: Positive on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Neutral: Neutral on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Sell: 
Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. 
Core Banding Exceptions (CBE): Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review 
Committee (IRC). Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's  
debt. As a result, stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. 
When such exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.
3) Complications from M&A integration.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,
Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7. We reserve the right to amend or supplement this policy at any time.

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trade Ideas

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.

ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS, $45.98, Buy, Price Target: $62)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like what we view as ANSYS global franchise in advanced simulation applications, and expect the companys cyclical 
demand fundamentals to continue strengthening over the course of 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we like the alignment 
between global wireless technology demand, and integration of electro-magnetic simulation with fluid and mechanical 
multiphysics in the flagship ANSYS product platform. We believe the companys acquisition of Apache Design Solutions, a 
successful startup with a strategic focus on semiconductor power integrity and low power requirements, will further solidify 
the companys position as the scale leader in simulation software technology.   
 
Valuation  
Our $62 price target is based on a 22.5x P/E on our revised CY2012 EPS estimate of $2.75. ANSS shares trade at a 20x 
P/E based on our revised CY2011 pro forma EPS estimate of $2.50. Shares of the design peer group median current-year 
P/E multiple is currently 19x. We believe that ANSS shares deserve a premium valuation compared to the peer group, 
based on what we view as the company's global franchise, unique competitive strengths, and first-ever scale attributes in 
fluid, and electromagnetic simulation software applications. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
ANSYS is historically acquisitive; acquisitions may involve product and organizational integration challenges: We believe 
CY11 will see ANSYS more active again with its M&A strategy, perhaps to consolidate market share or possibly add 
selected vertical market depth to its applications. ANSYS has capital-intensive end markets. Several of ANSYS' largest 
verticals,  including aerospace, automobiles and  industrial  equipment are  very  cyclical and subject to the more harsh 
capital constraints of those particular end markets.     
 
 
Fortinet Inc.  (NASDAQ: FTNT, $17.54, Buy, Price Target: $29)  
Dan Cummins | 212-468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We regard the recent slump in Fortinets share price as a buying opportunity because, above all, recent results continue to 
point to global market share gain, notwithstanding EMEA mid-year deceleration. In 2Q, revenues grew by 40%, or more, 
in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. Deferred revenue was up qtr/qtr, despite EMEA, implying a healthy pipeline overall for 
2H-2011. In our model, we project billings growth of 25% for 2011E. Growth in product revenue (45% of total), which, in 
turn, generates software subscriptions, which drives deferred revenue, is showing a strong positive trend, up 30-35% yr/yr 
for the first half of 2011, and renewal rates remain at record high levels. While developments in Europe raise the risk 
profile of FTNT shares, we continue to have high confidence in the companys competitive position and fundamentals.  
 
Valuation  
We base our $29 price target on a FCF per share multiple of 30x our FY12 FCF/share estimate of $0.95, above the 
current 26x based on our 2011E FCF estimate of $0.84. The security group peer median FCF multiple is currently 21x. 
We believe investors will continue to pay a premium multiple for the company's ability to potentially outperform estimates. 
Accordingly, we believe a 31x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
Although Fortinet is a leader in high-growth, unified-threat, management technology and appliances, there is a demand 
relationship to the core firewall technology market, which is mature and likely to experience increasing commoditization 
over time. As the market of firewall/VPN continues to mature over time, competitive pressures could erode margins and 
result in market share loss.

LSI Corp. (NYSE: LSI, $6.29, Buy, Price Target: $9)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
We are adding  LSI to  our Conviction  List, following  our recent  upgrade  of the stock. While demand across key end 
markets such as server/computing, data center storage, and wireless infrastructure has become increasingly uncertain, 
we nonetheless are encouraged by recent success in converting design wins across storage and networking into revenue. 
We expect revenue uplift from additional hard drive, server and networking design wins in the coming quarters. With room 
for additional operating leverage, we also expect company operating margins to progress toward the stated goal of 17% 
versus 2Q11 operating margin of 12.4%.  
 
Valuation  
Our price target of $9 represents 15x our new CY12 EPS estimate of $0.58. Our new price target implies a PEG of 1.1x, a 
slight premium the comparable median of 0.9x reflecting improving design win and share momentum. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The key risks for LSI Corporation include the following: 1) The market for storage and hard drive semiconductors remains 
competitive  and  it  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established  companies  as  well  as  emerging  solid-state  drive 
vendors.  2)  The  market  for  networking  is  highly  competitive  and  it  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established 
companies. 3) The company's revenue stream is exposed to any macro-driven slowdown in the spending in the enterprise 
and infrastructure end-markets, 4) The company's revenue is concentrated at two large customers, and is exposed to 
either slowing demand for these customers and/or potential design losses to competitors. 
 
 
Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX, $26.48, Buy, Price Target: $35)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
A strong beat-and-raise quarter with no apparent signs of weakness in any specific geography and vertical showcased 
MLNX's growth momentum and re-affirmed our conviction in one of our favorite names in our coverage universe. Based 
on  this  quarter's  performance,  we  have  further  evidence  to  believe  that  the  scale,  low  latency,  and  I/O  speed 
requirements,  hitherto  restricted  to  the  High  Performance  Computing  (HPC)  market,  are  now  becoming  increasingly 
common in mainstream Enterprise and Cloud applications, which should continue to drive MLNX on a strong growth path 
in the foreseeable future. Hence, we reiterate our Buy rating on MLNX shares and continue to include it on our Conviction 
Buy list. 
 
Valuation  
Our price target for MLNX shares is $35, which is based on a 20x P/E multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.60 and 
$2.78 cash per share. We believe a 20x P/E multiple is appropriate as it reflects a PEG ratio of 1x on our assumption of 
an earnings growth rate of 20%. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Mellanox is a component supplier to powerful OEMs that enjoy pricing leverage and are likely to change order patterns 
rapidly, which may affect revenue visibility for MLNX. Although Mellanox has enjoyed a virtual monopoly in InfiniBand, 
serious competition in the form of QLogic has begun to emerge in the market. QLogic could potentially cause severe price 
competition in the future as it tries to gain market share from MLNX. With the acquisition of VOLT, the InfiniBand market 
has become a two-horse race, in our view. If OEMs determine that they need to dual source their InfiniBand adaptors, 
QLGC could gain significant share in the market.  Additionally, customer inertia may prevent InfiniBand from moving 
beyond its current niche of High Performance Computing.

OPNET Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPNT, $29.55, Buy, Price Target: $43)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like OPNETs product strategy and execution in application performance monitoring (APM), where new challenges of 
complexity and network diversity among next generation, process-driven applications are creating growth opportunities. 
We believe OPNET will continue to raise its competitive profile in strategic APM, while taking share from a range of larger 
incumbents; the company has been reaping benefits of focused efforts to expand and improve the capabilities of its sales 
function, and we expect this trend to continue.    
 
Valuation   
Our $43 per-share price target is based on a P/FCF multiple of 28x based on our FY13E FCF estimate of $1.55 (+25% 
yr/yr). OPNT shares currently trade at 27x our FY12E FCF per share estimate of $1.24. At our $43 price target 12 months 
from now, OPNT shares would trade at a 32x P/E based on our FY2013 pro forma EPS estimate of $1.34, compared to 
the current 33x P/E multiple based on our FY12 estimate of $1.00. We believe investors will continue to pay a high 
multiple of FCF for OPNT shares in anticipation of strong revenue growth and margin accretion. Accordingly, we believe a 
28x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  Network  instrumentation  market  is  fragmented,  and  competition  amongst  existing  vendors  could  be  a  source  of 
margin compression. Large players could develop their own solutions and infringe upon OPNET's turf. OPNET occupies a 
niche in the broader Network Management space. The niche does not have a large vendor in this space. We believe that 
continued macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to a larger portion of deals getting consummated over longer cycles, 
hence, delaying revenue recognition. 
 
 
Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL, $24.78, Buy, Price Target: $40)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe Oracle today exerts greater global account control than ever, resulting in share gains of customers IT budgets 
and a stronger ability to enter new markets. Supplemented by its successful acquisition strategy, Oracle has attained the 
#1 market share position in both the database and middleware markets, and a #2 position in the application software 
market.  Because  this  stack  is  increasingly  based  on  industry  standards  for  programming  and  exposing  data,  the 
marketplace is gravitating toward Oracle's offerings over those of second-tier providers, in our view.  Additionally, ORCL 
has only reported a full-year EPS decline once in the last 12 years (and even then, only 4%), and we believe ORCL's 
earnings resiliency has improved, as recurring maintenance revenue comprises 50% of revenue, versus 37% in FY02, 
and Oracle is advantaged by greater economies of scale today. In our view, this earnings resiliency and earnings growth 
that are more attractive to that of the S&P 500 deserve a premium valuation rather than a discount or market-average 
valuation, and we believe this equilibrium will be restored over time.   
 
Valuation   
On CY: 2012E P/E basis, ORCL trades at 13x (ex-cash) our CY:2012 estimate of $2.54, which is in line with the S&P 500 
group average of 13x. Our $40 price target for ORCL shares is based on a 15x (ex-cash) multiple applied to our FY:2013 
EPS estimate of $2.67/share. We believe that ORCL maintains a slightly higher valuation multiple for its out-year and 
believe this multiple is appropriate since, historically, ORCL shares have traded at an in-line to slight premium to the 
average market multiple of 15x, and we expect the shares to continue to trade at a multiple that is in line with the historical 
level. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks  to  our  price  target  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  1)  Prolonged  weakness  in  IT  spending;  2)  macroeconomic 
fluctuations;  3)  acquisition  integration  challenges;  4)  competition;  5)  departure  of  key  management  personnel  could 
impede our price target.

QUALCOMM Inc.  (NASDAQ: QCOM, $46.52, Buy, Price Target: $75)  
Mark McKechnie | 415-249-1988 | mmckechnie@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
QUALCOMM delivered a solid report and outlook in what we view as a "transitional" quarter ahead of two major 2H11 
drivers: Apples iPhone5 and Nokia's WindowsPhone7 (WP7) models. The quarter confirmed our thesis on QCOM as the 
best large cap semi play on smart phones and tablets as it powered through rough overall industry waters with improved 
earnings prospects. We look for potential upside relative to our new forecast to become more apparent as we approach 
the September reporting period.   
 
Valuation   
Our QCOM $75 price target is based on 21.4x our FY12 (September) EPS estimate of $3.50 and does not include $11.97 
per share in net cash. We justify the multiple on 1) our view of QCOM's leading royalty and chip position in smart phones, 
2) what we see as near-term potential upside from increased chips share with the iPhone5 and NOK's WindowsPhone7, 
and 3) what we see as potential upside from SnapDragon tablet wins.   
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target include: 1) Slower-than-anticipated industry unit growth; 2) Faster erosion of handset average 
selling prices; 3) Increased chip competition; and 4) general compression of market multiples.    
 
 
RightNow Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: RNOW, $27.52, Buy, Price Target: $38)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our recent survey work indicates the marketplace momentum of replacing legacy, single-channel on premise Customer 
Experience  solutions  with  multi-channel  cloud  based  solutions  is  accelerating  compared  to  six  month  ago.  We  think 
RNOW will benefit disproportionately from this replacement cycle since RightNow Technologies is the farthest along in 
building an Enterprise-scale cloud-based Customer Experience suite of solutions for large B2C businesses, in our view.  
Additionally, RightNows business model is positively levered to the mobile tsunami trend due to its volume-based usage 
pricing  model.  These  strong  market  tailwinds  plus  reported  TTM  current  software  backlog  growth  of  27%  gives  us 
confidence that new business and cash flow trends are accelerating, and we maintain a positive bias to current consensus 
expectations.  We believe the shares could appreciate through either higher estimate revisions or multiple expansion as 
the current discount valuation to the SaaS group average narrows over time.    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 price target is based on approximately 27x our EV/2012E OCF of $48M (cash from operations), which is a slight 
discount to the current average SaaS companies' EV/FTM OCF estimated multiple of 29. We use a 27 multiple to derive 
our price target, as we expect the shares to trade at a multiple that is essentially in line with the SaaS group average.    
 
Risks to Price Target   
Risks to our price target include: 1) Competition; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) acquisition integration challenges; 4) 
increased churn; and 5) slow customer adoption of Cx solutions. 
 
 
Skyworks Solutions Inc.   (NASDAQ: SWKS, $18.78, Buy, Price Target: $30)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis 
We are adding SWKS to our Conviction List. We expect relative resilience in the smartphone and tablet markets given 
strong customer interest and product cycles. With multiple smartphone customers ramping new models in the next few 
quarters, we expect SWKS to benefit from its market leading position in the handset radio frequency components market. 
We  also  expect  benefit  from  increasing  use  of  wireless  connectivity  beyond  traditional  handsets.  Lastly,  we  are

                                                                                                   Industry Report       

                                                    
 
encouraged by the company's ramp of new competitive filter products to more aggressively address a broader array of 
market opportunities. 
 
Valuation  
Our $30 price target is based on a 14x target multiple on our CY12 EPS estimate of $2.10, implying a PEG of 0.8x, a 
slight premium to the comparable average 0.7x, which we believe is deserved, given the company's market position and 
share gain opportunity. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
The key risks for Skyworks Solutions include the following: 1) The markets for handset front-end components and analog 
are  highly  competitive,  and  the  company  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established  competitors,  along  with 
competition in analog. 2) Consistency in financial results in recent years leaves the stock more vulnerable than peers to a 
management  execution  misstep,  in  our  view.  3)  We  believe  that  the  increasing  complexity  of  wireless  front-end 
components could expand the risk of product delays and/or issues versus in the past. 
 
 
Spansion, Inc.  (NYSE: CODE, $14.16, Buy, Price Target: $25)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis    
We   view   Spansion   as   the   leader   in   the   embedded   NOR  flash   memory  market   for   diversified   end   markets   in 
industrial/automotive,  telecom/networking,  computing  and  consumer  electronics.  Since  emerging  from  bankruptcy,  we 
believe that Spansion has executed well in regaining share in the embedded flash market with consistent revenue growth, 
higher margins, and free cash flow using its proprietary MirrorBit flash memory technology and a "FabLite" manufacturing 
strategy. Spansion has what we view as: a diversified customer base of over 4,000 global customers, good design win 
momentum, a focused new management team, a flexible Fab Lite manufacturing strategy and recent strong revenue and 
earnings growth.   
 
Valuation   
Our $25 price target is based on an approximate 10x P/E on our calendar 2011E pro forma EPS estimate of $2.55 relative 
to our outlook for 12% secular earnings growth. Given the consolidation in the NOR industry likely leading to more stable 
pricing with Spansion and Micron technology being the two main competitors in the high-performance embedded NOR 
flash  market,  strong  demand  drivers  currently  in  the  embedded  NOR  market,  technology  leadership,  and  good 
management execution, we believe that a forward multiple of 10x on our calendar 2011E EPS is justified relative to our 
Spansion secular earnings growth outlook. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
The  following  risks  are  inherent  to  investing  in  Spansion:  general  business  and  economic  conditions;  demand  for 
products; changes in customer order patterns; the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks. In addition, Spansion's recent emergence from Chapter 11 implies that 
the company has to re-engage and win back new and existing customers who may not have a business relationship. 
Spansion also has to rapidly transition to a "Fab Lite" flexible, manufacturing strategy of using its captive Fab in Austin, 
coupled with foundries such as Elpida, SMIC etc. Additionally, Spansion still has significant debt load which may constrain 
its operational flexibility; especially in weak economic times.

VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW, $76.76, Buy, Price Target: $110)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Our conviction in VMWs growth story is further enhanced after yet another beat-and-raise in VMWs 2QFY11, driven by 
broad-based growth across geographies, verticals and product-lines. FCF/share was, once again, well ahead of EPS, 
indicating to us that VMW continues to be a very strategic vendor for its customers, who remain willing to sign multi-year 
contracts with VMW and keep driving VMW's deferred revenue higher. We remind investors that, despite VMW's strong 
investment mode, we think it remains likely to see significant operating margin expansion in future yearspotentially a 
1000-point expansion over the next three years. In our view, this could lead to a very significant increase in earnings 
power and FCF generation, well ahead of current, long-term Street estimates. We believe VMW is the undisputed leader 
in virtualization and Cloud build-outthe top IT secular growth trends today in our view. In our opinion, VMW is poised to 
extend  this  lead  as  it  innovates  ahead  of  its  competitors  and  executes  effectively,  potentially  driving  stronger  FCF 
generation  and  significant  operating  margin  expansion  in  the  future.  With  a  new  product  cycle  (vSphere  5)  and  an 
upcoming trade show as likely upside catalysts, we continue to include the name on our Conviction Buy list. 
 
Valuation   
Our $110 price target is based on an approximate, ex-cash per share, 31x multiple to our FY12 FCF estimate of $3.30 per 
share. The 31x multiple implies a PEG ratio of 1.03x, assuming a long-term FCF growth rate of ~30%, which, we believe 
is appropriate, given the early stage of the company's opportunity and its strong strategic positioning. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Competition  with  Microsoft  and  the  open-source  community.  Challenges  associated  with  any  new  technology.  EMC 
owning 97% of voting rights and likely competing with VMware in some areas. Acquisitions could lead to dilution.

Active Network Inc. (NYSE: ACTV, $16.23, Buy, Price Target: $23)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Active is a leading provider of cloud-based reservation and marketing solutions serving a variety of customer groups, 
including  business  events,  community  activities,  outdoors,  and  sports.  Our  Buy  rating  is  based  on:  1)  strong  growth 
potential  in  an  underpenetrated  $10B  North  American  technology  fee  opportunity,  2)  Active  provides  a  strong  value 
proposition to both organizations and consumers, 3) numerous growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term 
growth, and 4) attractive financial characteristics with highly predictable revenues and high incremental EBITDA margins.   
 
Valuation   
Our $23 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based on 25x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $54M. We believe a 25x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks for Active Network include risks of integrating acquisitions; competition; slower adoption of web-based reservation 
systems; the macroeconomic environment; transition to the ActiveWorks platform; expansion into new businesses and 
risks surrounding International expansion.   
 
 
Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU, $126.98, Buy, Price Target: $200)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
We  remain  positive  on  BIDU  shares,  and  expect  continued  strong  growth  driven  by  1)  continued  consumer  Internet 
adoption  we expect China to add another 70 million Internet users in 2011 up from approximately 450M at the end of 
2010 (33% online penetration); 2) continued merchant adoption  we estimate Baidu has approximately 5% market share 
among  its  addressable  market  of  5 million  larger  SMEs  in  China;  3)  strong  growth  in  emerging  categories  including 
eCommerce; 4) continued monetization improvements. We believe these factors should lead to 60% plus top-line growth 
in 2011 and we expect continued strong incremental margins which we expect to lead to 70% plus EPS growth.    
 
Valuation   
Our $200 price target for BIDU shares is based on a 45x P/E to our 2012 pro forma EPS estimate. We believe a 45x 
multiple is justified, given our outlook for 40%-plus long-term EPS growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Key risks for Baidu include an economic slowdown in China, increased regulatory action, increased competition, and lack 
of a developed eCommerce market.    
 
 
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY, $27.16, Buy, Price Target: $41)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
eBay reported a solid quarter with strength in both Payments (29% Y/Y FX neutral vs. 27% last quarter) and improved 
Marketplace GMV (10% Y/Y vs. 8% in 1Q). U.S. GMV accelerated to 14% Y/Y, driven primarily by an improved user 
experience, better search, and more top- rated sellers. We are encouraged by the improved business fundamentals and 
solid traction of the company's growth initiatives, such as mobile payment. Payments growth momentum continued with 
total payment revenue up 29% Y/Y FX neutral (vs. 27% last quarter), driven by further penetration on both Merchant 
Services and on-eBay. Segment margin expanded 200 bps Y/Y benefiting from stable transaction margin, continuing 
operating leverage and improvement in BML.  Both U.S. and international were solid in the quarter: U.S. non-vehicle GMV 
accelerated 400 bps sequentially, mainly driven by improvement in the user interface, search experience (i.e., removal of

duplicate listings), and more sales from trusted sellers. Solid European growth and stabilizing Korean growth led to 200 
bps sequential growth acceleration for international in 2Q.  
 
Valuation  
Our $41 EBAY price target is based on approximately 16x our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $2.34 plus net cash, which we 
believe is appropriate given our outlook of 5-10% long-term growth for the marketplace business and 15-20% long-term 
growth for the payment business. For our price target, we apply a 12x multiple to Marketplace 2012E PF EPS, a 25x 
multiple to Payments 2012E EPS, and add $4 in cash/investments, which equates to our $41 PT. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Key risks for eBay include competition, adverse currency movements, inability to improve eBay's user experience, and 
economic weakness. 
 
 
Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS, $19.31, Buy, Price Target: $28)    
Atul Bagga | 415-249-6362 | abagga@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are positive on ERTS's proposed acquisition of PopCap, given growth in social and smart phone games that was 
faster than we had expected; better than we expected EPS accretion from the deal; the quality of PopCap assets; and a 
potential to accelerate growth in higher-quality Games-as-a-Service business.  We are raising our estimates and  now 
expect EPS growth at 21% Y/Y and 39% Y/Y EPS during FY12 and FY13 respectively, driven largely by growing revenue 
contribution from relatively lucrative Games-as-a-Service segment.   
 
Valuation 
Our $28 price target on ERTS shares is based on a 26x PE (net of cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.82 versus a 13x 
average  for  the  shares  of  the  peer  group. We  think  that  the  premium  is  appropriate,  given  that  we  believe  that  the 
company  has strong franchises and the  potential to monetize these franchises on emerging platforms and given the 
company's focus on the faster-growing Games-as-a-Service segment.    
 
Risks to Price Target 
Gaming  continues  to  be  a  hit-or-miss-driven  business,  and  predicting  successful  titles  versus  unsuccessful  titles  is 
extremely difficult. The risk is especially high for the new and unproven IPs, and a company's reliance on the new IPs and 
the titles in the established franchises to reach the revenue target opens it to risk of a revenue miss. Additionally, we 
believe there are macro headwinds given the increasing popularity of the used games and free-to-play online games.   
 
 
Velti PLC (NASDAQ: VELT, $10.64, Buy, Price Target: $22)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Velti reported a strong Q2 result (revenue of $34.4M was up 57% Y/Y and came in 8% higher than our forecast), but the 
stock traded down we believe in reaction to higher OpEx investments and negative (and we believe misplaced) read-
through from Motricitys negative Q2 earnings report. We believe that the sell-off in VELT shares is misguided and that 
shares represent a compelling value at 8.2x our FY12E EBITDA estimate of $87M. At current levels, we believe investors 
have  the  unique  opportunity  to  acquire  a  leading  SaaS  tools/solutions  provider  serving  the  rapidly  emerging  mobile 
marketing and advertising ecosystem for a traditional media multiple. We believe that shares will rebound during the 
companys seasonally strong 2H and that shares should be aggressively acquired at the current valuation.  
 
Valuation 
We note that shares of interactive marketing services peers currently trade at an average FY12E EV/EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 8x, while SaaS companies currently trade at an average of 16x FY12E EV/EBITDA. Given the company's 
growing SaaS revenue streams and what we view as its superior growth and long-term margin prospects, we believe 
VELT shares should trade toward the higher end of the 8-16x range, especially given the fact that the company is likely to

grow significantly faster than SaaS peers for the foreseeable future, in our view. Accordingly, we apply a 14x multiple 
against our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $86.8M to derive our $22 12-month price target. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks to our price target  include the  very early stage of development of the mobile marketing/advertising technology 
opportunity, customer/category concentration, geographic risk, ongoing development of internal controls, working capital 
requirements, competition, and the high degree of seasonality present in the business.  
 
HEALTHCARE / LIFE SCIENCES  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY, $6.62, Buy, Price Target: $18)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
ALNY is making solid progress towards its 5x15 goals by advancing numerous early stage programs and preparing for 2 
important 4Q11 dataset announcements. In 4Q11, we are primarily focused on ALN-TTR proof of concept (POC) data that 
will be presented at a major Amyloid meeting. We view ALN-TTR as one of ALNY's most promising emerging pipeline 
compounds based on due diligence with our KOLs and therapeutic potential in a disease with unmet medical need and 
clear genetically defined targets. Given a low $60M EV and near-term drivers, ALNY represents an attractive risk reward, 
in our view.  
 
2H11 Drivers: We believe the next two years (and especially 2H11) will show two additional important pipeline proof of 
concept (POC) data sets that we expect could drive shares significantly from current levels. In 3Q11, ALNY plans to 
announce Phase 1 POC data for ALN-TTR01 in TTR Amyloidosis. The trial's primary goal is to evaluate safety, but it also 
includes secondary end points the Street should find meaningful, such as ALN-TTR treatment's effect on circulating TTR 
plasma levels measured as percentage (%) lowering of TTR from pretreatment/baseline TTR levels. Our TTR consultants 
would be encouraged to observe 10-20% plasma TTR reductions while they believe up to 50% is also possible in this trial. 
They generally believe a 50% plasma TTR reduction is enough to cause TTR plaque regression or slow progression of 
the disease by 50% (factor of 2). By YE11, we believe ALN-PCS data for hypercholesterolemia patients should become 
available. ALNY has not yet specified the end points for this trial, but we believe it is also committed to measuring efficacy 
in a manner that would be appreciated by the Street. In 2011, ALNY further plans to disclose two additional pipeline 
programs. In 2012, ALNY plans to enter ALN-ALN-HTT for Huntington's Disease and ALN-HPN for refractory anemia into 
the clinic. 
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $18 is based on a sum-of-parts analysis by estimating YE11 cash (12-month forward) at 
approximately $8-9 per share and adding $9 per share ($410M) in pipeline technology value. Risks include IP litigation; 
delivery failures; clinical, regulatory, and competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and extended timelines to potential 
profitability.   
 
Risks to Price Target  
ALNYs  lead  product  candidates  appear  to  be  at  least  a  few  years  from  market  and  may  face  significant  clinical, 
regulatory, and competitive risks. Additionally, IP litigation and failure to make advances in RNAi delivery could lead to 
extended timelines to potential profitability. We also anticipate significant changes to the marketplace as new medicines 
are  introduced.  To  reiterate,  primary  investment  risks  include  IP  litigation;  delivery  failures;  clinical,  regulatory,  and 
competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and future financing risk.

NuVasive Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA, $21.08, Buy, Price Target: $39)    
Sameer Harish | 415-249-1989 | sharish@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We expect NuVasive sales growth to accelerate through 2012.  We expect significant upside to NUVAs share price if the 
company continues to meet or beat numbers and demonstrates additional leverage in 2011. NuVasives suite of minimally 
invasive spine implants and instruments are designed to improve surgical outcomes, reduce blood loss and pain, and 
speed recovery. The company has successfully created a market for its lateral access spine products and continues to 
increase the number of physician users. Additionally, NuVasive has a high-margin business model boasting 80%+ gross 
margins implant business and serves the robust and fast growing minimally-invasive spine market.   
 
Momentum in minimally invasive and lateral spine surgery is building. NuVasive expects this segment of the spine market 
to grow 15% in 2011 despite a flat to down market for total spine procedures. However, a key driver for the market interest 
is the recent flurry of competitive product introductions. Ultimately, we believe the heightened interest in minimally invasive 
and lateral access surgery may increase overall surgeon interest in XLIF and NeuroVision. We believe NuVasive will be 
able to convert many of these surgeons to XLIF in the future with superior nerve avoidance technology, supportive clinical 
data, and a market-leading portfolio of lateral focused implants and tools. Channel checks have shown more established 
physicians tend to seek XLIF training, often seeking better techniques to benefit their patients after years of limited clinical 
success. These surgeons tend to be stickier, longer-term adopters of technology, we believe, and less likely to pursue 
lower cost alternatives which may lack critical features. Notably, driving physician utilization through training is at the 
center of NuVasives near-term growth strategy. Operating leverage will also be driven by sale force maturation, as well as 
an expanding product offering, and fixed-cost efficiencies, in our view.    
 
We believe international markets offer significant potential growth opportunities to complement U.S. growth. We expect 
NuVasive to invest heavily in international markets, which represent approximately $20% of the global $9 billion spine 
market.  Currently  international  revenues  comprise  only  5%  of  NuVasives  revenues;  however,  the  company  expects 
international revenues to comprise approximately 10% of revenues as the company approaches $1B in revenues. 
 
Valuation   
Our $39 price target is based upon 3x our 2012 revenue estimate of $602.9 million. This is a discount to the comparable 
medtech companies' averages of 3.8x 2012 revenues. NuVasive shares are trading at 1.8x our 2012 revenues and 2.1x 
our 2011 revenues of $532.8 million, compared to the medtech companies'' average of 3.9x 2011 revenues. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
NuVasive   operates   in   a   highly   competitive   and   dynamic   industrynew   technology   and   innovation   from   other 
organizations  may  change  NuVasives  ability  to  successfully  grow  in  their  markets  and  may  make  the  companys 
technology  obsolete. Additional  near-term risks include pricing  or reimbursement pressures, slowing market for spine 
surgery, timing and/or loss of orders to large hospital or physician groups, clinical guideline changes, delays in regulatory 
filings and supply and manufacturing disruptions.

Ceradyne Inc.  (NASDAQ: CRDN, $27.17, Buy, Price Target: $45)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe CRDN is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward increased applications of advanced 
ceramics in the industrial and energy market due to lightweight, heat, and wear advantages versus incumbent materials. 
Near term, we believe the company is getting better yield on its military business as it more effectively meets product 
specs. Second, the company is getting better utilization of its manufacturing assets having closed two facilities in 2010 
and getting better utilization as revenue increases. Third, the company's mix of products is migrating to higher margin 
opportunities in solar and industrial applications. We believe these three drivers will remain intact going forward. We are 
also encouraged by the company's investment in additional Boron separation capacity this year along with the accelerated

sufficient to drive material growth over the next several years.    
 
Valuation 
We give shares of CRDN a Buy rating and a price target of $45 based on 13x our 2012E EPS of $3.43, which we believe 
is appropriate as it is in line with peers.

Johnson Controls Inc.  (NYSE: JCI, $28.83, Buy, Price Target: $50)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We  continue  to  highlight  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  Cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification  of  the  transportation  market.  We  continue  to  believe  the  company's  Power  Solutions  and  Automotive 
Experience segments are positioned for improvement. We also continue to believe that the company is well positioned to 
benefit from multi-year revenue and margin growth in its Building Efficiency segment. In addition, we note that JCI's entry 
into the demand response (DR) market signals that the DR market is a large enough addressable opportunity to warrant 
investment and that the economics of DR contracts are likely to change substantially over time and move more toward 
commodity pricing. We believe that JCI's entry into the DR market may be driven in part by a desire to retain customers. 
We also note interest from global energy regulators. In the United States, we note that FERC's Order 745 sets up a 
framework for DR providers to receive Locational Marginal Pricing, while the TVA's recent Integrated Resource Plan has 
increased focus on Energy Efficiency and DR. The European Energy Commission's recent communication on its 2011 
Energy Efficiency Plan states continued focus on Building Efficiency improvements. We also note statements from various 
news sources that Germany plans to increase its focus on Offshore Wind and Building Efficiency.   
 
Valuation  
We gives shares of JCI a Buy rating and price target of $50, based on 15x our FY2012E EPS estimate of $3.31, a modest 
premium to diversified industrial peers due to our expectation for JCI to grow faster than peers. JCI is at a slight premium 
to shares of diversified industrial peers due to its exposure to strong growth markets and positive product mix shift, in our 
opinion.  We  also  view  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification of the transportation market.

Rogers Corp. (NYSE: ROG, $43.15, Buy, Price Target: $64)    
Shawn Severson | 415-249-1986 | sseverson@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We are of the belief that Rogers is only in the early stages of a multi-year growth story built on key applications in the 
cleantech,  Internet  and  mass  transit  markets.  We  think  many  of  the  company's  products  are  high  value  added 
components, yet account for a relatively small portion of the bill of materials. This is a very important distinction as it can 
provide some price protection and insulation from competition as commercial volumes scale in markets such as electric 
vehicles  and  smart  phones/tablets,  in  our  view.  We  think  the  current  valuation  provides  a  significant  opportunity  for 
investors to build a position and we expect multiple expansion and solid earnings growth to prevail over the coming 12 
months.

Valuation  
Our price target for ROG shares is $64, based on a PE of 18x our FY12 EPS estimate of $3.43. Our target multiple is in 
line with the shares' average valuation since 2005. We believe the multiple expansion from the current level will be driven 
by investors recognizing what we view as strong secular megatrends developing for the company and the potential effect 
on earnings over the next three years. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Although we believe the company is likely to benefit from positive megatrends, the company is still likely to be sensitive to 
broader  economic  conditions.  As  was  displayed  clearly  during  the  financial  crisis  and  subsequent  recession,  ROG's 
products and, hence, revenues are subject to cyclical trends. As we have stated previously, we believe ROG has solid 
growth  opportunities in some key sectors, but this  would not be enough to offset a meaningful decline in the  global 
economy. Failure of key growth markets to materialize. Our investment thesis is dependent a couple key markets and any 
significant or permanent disruption in those markets could have a sustained negative effect on the shares. Specifically, the 
prospects for 4G deployment, rail infrastructure in developing countries, and the adoption rate of HEV/EV around the 
world.

Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST, $74.36, Buy, Price Target: $90)  
Edward Weller | 415 249 1377 | eweller@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
With high gas prices and food inflation both intensifying the consumers usual quest for value, the combination of Costcos 
always  extremely  aggressive  pricing  and  what  appears  to  be  improving  customer  service  seem  to  us  to  be  driving 
increased frequency among existing members and new customer sign-ups, as well. Comp store customer traffic has been 
rising by 4% month after month for more than two years now and we believe that customers will continue to favor Costco 
for more of their purchases. Whats more, international operations (ex the UK business) seems to be firing on all cylinders 
and   an   incipient   recovery   in   Southern   California,   historically   Costcos   most   profitable   regions,   can   have   a 
disproportionately favorable impact on profitability for the next couple of years. We expect that ROIs will continue to rise, 
that  Costco  will  increase  its  growth  rate  and,  by  putting  more  capital  to  work  at  those  high  ROIs,  drive  increasing 
shareholder value. We reiterate our Buy on Costco.   
 
Valuation  
The rising valuations that we foresee in coming years derive directly from this recovery to normal  or recently normal  
returns, and those rising returns should drive richer valuations in our view. These generally rising returns, in combination 
with our estimates of slowly rising company investment suggest a price target a year from now of $90. (See our extensive 
valuation methodology in our report entitled  COST: Closes Quarter Strong, Recovery Still Building in Southern California , 
             th
dated May 18  , 2011.     
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential risks to our forecasts and to our estimates and price target for Costco include: yet a further general economic 
slowdown  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  or  other  region  important  to  the  company;  interruptions  in  merchandise 
availability; continued upward pressure on operating expenses; and greater-than-anticipated competitive pressures.

Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.

Quarter  Highlights. Active  Network  reported  a  solid  Q2  with  both  revenue  and  EBITDA  above  our  estimates  and

consensus. Revenues of $99M (up 21% Y/Y) exceeded our estimate of $95M and consensus of $95.2M. Revenue upside

was mainly driven by higher marketing services and software fees. Registration revenues of $69.7M (15% Y/Y) were slightly

below our $70.6M estimate. Registrations increased 7% Y/Y (vs. our 8% estimate) while revenue per registration increased

8%  (in  line  with  our  estimate).  Software  revenues  of  $15.8M  (49%  Y/Y)  exceeded  our  $13.3M  estimate  as  a  few  deals

closed  sooner  than  we  expected.  Marketing  Services  revenues  of  $13.5M  (28%  Y/Y)  exceeded  our  $11.1M  estimate  as

Active  benefited  from  higher  advertising  on  its  core  destination  Websites.  Top-line  upside  and  mix  shift  to  higher  margin

marketing services helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $20.4M, 16% above our and the Street estimates.

Key Metrics:

  Net registration revenue was up 15% Y/Y, versus our estimate of 16.6% Y/Y.

  Registrations was up 7% Y/Y to 22,926, versus our estimate of 8% and 23,200, respectively.

  Net registration revenue per registration was up 8% Y/Y to $3.04, roughly in line with our estimates.

VALUATION:
Our $23 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based on 25x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $54M. We believe a 25x
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth.

RISKS TO PRICE TARGET:
Acquisitions. Active  has  been  highly  acquisitive,  with  over  25  acquisitions  over  the  past  five  years.  Going  forward,  we
believe the company will likely continue to be acquisitive to gain share and expand into new categories and geographies.
While we believe the company's track record in integrating acquisitions has been good thus far, acquisitions always create
uncertainties and could be a distraction for management.

Competition. While we believe the market for Web-based reservations and activity-based software is highly fragmented, we
believe the large and growing market opportunity is likely to attract additional entrants. Today, Active primarily competes
with legacy registration methods such as pen and paper, mail, and phone based reservations. Additionally, Active competes
with internally developed software applications, off-the-shelf software (i.e., Microsoft Excel), as well as companies that offer
Web-based solutions in one or more of its vertical areas.

Slower Adoption of Web-Based Reservation Systems. While online penetration for events and activities registration is
still low today, which we believe presents significant growth potential for the company, slower-than-expected online adoption
from organizations and participants may limit Active Network's near-term growth potential.

Macroeconomic  Environment. We  believe  the  activities  and  events  market  is  sensitive  to  consumer  sentiment  and  the
overall economic environment. For instance, the company experienced a significant slowdown in its business in the second
half  of  2008  due  to  the  economic  downturn.  In  addition,  due  to  the  company's  exposure  to  the  parks  and  recreation
segment, governmental budgetary cuts could adversely impact the company's growth rates.

Transition to ActiveWorks Platform. While we believe the company's transition from its legacy platform to PaaS-based
ActiveWorks  should  drive  increased  efficiencies  and  margin  expansion,  the  transition  is  time  consuming  and  requires
significant investment. We note that in 2010, approximately 35% of Active's research and development spending was on the
legacy  platform.  We  currently  expect  Active  to  transition  off  the  legacy  platform  by  2014.  Delays  in  the  transition  (i.e.,
difficulties in convincing customers to migrate) would likely adversely impact Active's operating leverage.

                                               commerce. The company is seeing strong growth in social games driven largely by
                                               improving  conversion  rates.  The  company  expects  continued  momentum  in  social
                                               games  driven  by  improving  conversion  and  growing  usage  from  platforms  such  as

ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS, $54.73, Buy, Price Target: $62)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like what we view as ANSYS global franchise in advanced simulation applications, and expect the companys cyclical 
demand fundamentals to continue strengthening over the course of 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we like the alignment 
between global wireless technology demand, and integration of electro-magnetic simulation with fluid and mechanical 
multiphysics in the flagship ANSYS (current version 13) platform. We regard the version 13 product cycle as a major 
product release which we expect to further spur cross-sale efforts in CY11, and motivate a new group of select, certified 
channel dealers.   
 
Valuation  
Our $62 price target is based on a 24x P/E on our CY2012 EPS estimate of $2.58. The design peer group median current-
year P/E multiple is currently 22x. We believe that ANSS shares deserve a premium valuation, based on what we view as 
the company's unique competitive strengths and first-ever scale attributes in simulation applications for manufacturing and 
process industries. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
ANSYS is historically acquisitive; acquisitions may involve product and organizational integration challenges: We believe 
CY11 will see ANSYS more active again with its M&A strategy, perhaps to consolidate market share or possibly add 
selected vertical market depth to its applications. ANSYS has capital-intensive end markets. Several of ANSYS' largest 
verticals,  including aerospace, automobiles and  industrial  equipment are  very  cyclical and subject to the more harsh 
capital constraints of those particular end markets.     
 
 
Aruba Networks, Inc.  (NASDAQ: ARUN, $27.61, Buy, Price Target: $38)  
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Potential Near Term Catalyst   
ARUN's third consecutive  quarter  of accelerating top-line growth suggests to us that the WLAN secular  trend  is just 
beginning and  ARUN, given  its security-based  differentiation and solid execution,  is benefiting disproportionately  and 
gaining  significant  share.  While  the  sequential  GM  decline  (attributed  to  mix-shift  to  international  geographies)  was 
surprising, we believe as US re-accelerates in upcoming quarters, ARUN's GM should rebound, providing a tailwind to OM 
expansion. Given our belief that ARUN's rapid growth, indirect model, and high repeat purchase rate in installed base 
should result in materially higher earnings power beyond current Street estimates, we reiterate our Buy rating.   
 
Longer term, we believe the rapid proliferation of wi-fi devices and the October 2009 ratification of the 802.11n standard 
are strong catalysts of WLAN adoption across the globe, and are driving a strong wireless networking secular trend. As 
enterprises move to 802.11n WLANs, it creates a need for a significant upgrade to WLAN infrastructure, which is unlike 
the change from 11b to 11g, creating a significant opportunity for ARUN to gain market share.  ARUN is the largest WLAN 
pure-play  and  the  mind-share  leader  in  the  market,  which  we  believe  is  a  result  of  ARUN's  superior  security-based 
differentiation.  Security, according to our checks, is the most important concern for enterprise WLAN prospects, and 
considering enhancing this differentiation has been ARUNs R&D focus in recent times (as evident from the companys 
analyst  day  and  product  announcements)  which  gives  us  reason  to  believe  that  ARUN  can  continue  to  benefit 
disproportionately from secular trends.   
 
Valuation  
Our $38 ARUN price target is based on an ex-cash 54x PE multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.68, considering our 
40% long-term growth assumption implies a PEG of 1.3x, which we believe is appropriate, given what we view as ARUN's 
superior positioning in an early-stage high-growth opportunity and its superior execution as reflected in its fast expanding 
operating model.

Risks to Price Target 
In addition to the typical competitive risks, other investment risks include the dependence on the adoption of advanced 
technologies by customers, lengthening sales cycles, dependence on outsourced manufacturing, dependence on sales 
through VARs and OEMs, and adverse effects of international conflicts on operations or business conditions.   
 
 
Entropic Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ENTR, $8.41, Buy, Price Target: $13)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We view Entropic as a key investment theme that benefits from the widespread adoption of Multimedia-over-coax (MOCA) 
technology for distributing high definition, premium video content within the home for multi-room DVR installations. We 
believe that the market is still early in MoCA penetration with an eventual run-rate opportunity of 40 million MoCA chips 
per  year  and  potential  longer-term  growth  opportunities  such  as  MoCA  2.0  platforms  and  high-volume  consumer 
electronics such as HDTVs, Blu-Ray players, game consoles, PCs etc. We expect the company to see continuing good 
business momentum over the next 12 months driven by multiple cable, satellite, and telco service providers rolling out 
MOCA based multi-room DVR premium video services.   
 
Valuation  
Our $13 price target is based on a P/E of 15x our calendar 2012E EPS of $0.85 relative to our outlook for 15% secular 
earnings growth. We believe that a 15x target P/E multiple is justified relative to our outlook for 15% secular earnings 
growth using a PEG ratio of 100% and assuming that ENTR remains a dominant, high-growth provider of networked home 
entertainment system-level solutions with high entry barriers. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
The key investment risks for Entropic Communications are: 1) the market for its products is highly competitive, and they 
face competition from a number of established companies. 2) The company receives a substantial portion of revenues 
from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or a few of its major 
customers would likely adversely affect its operations and financial condition. The company's growth is dependent on the 
deployments  plans  for multi-room  HD  video  distribution  by  a  small  group  of  cable  service  providers;  satellite  service 
providers; and telco service providers. Any delay in deployment plans by these customers could materially affect revenues 
for Entropic. 3) Average selling prices of products in markets served have historically decreased over time and will likely 
do so in the future, which could harm revenues and gross profits.  
 
 
Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc.   (NYSE: FCS, $15.85, Buy, Price Target: $22)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
We view Fairchild Semiconductor as well positioned with its power and analog products to benefit from customer focus on 
mobility and energy efficiency. We expect increasing content and margin expansion to drive earnings growth in the next 
few quarters, as the company executes its on-going product mix improvement strategy.  We believe that Fairchild is well 
positioned  across  its  low  and  higher  power  business  segments  to  benefit  from  growth  in  key  end  markets. We  see 
company products levered to growth in handsets, smartphones, notebooks, servers, home appliances, digital television 
and automotive markets. In certain key markets, we expect the content opportunity to more than double over the next few 
years as the company targets an increasing portion of available content. From its position in high growth markets, we 
believe the company is driving a favorable mix shift toward more differentiated, high margin products. We believe that the 
greater than 1,000bps increase in gross margin over the last five years is evidence of the effectiveness of management's 
product strategy. We expect product momentum to continue driving further gross margin expansion for the company. 
Additionally, with what we think is an opportunity for growth in key end markets coupled with margin expansion, we expect 
Fairchild EPS to increase at least 12% annually in the next few years.

                                                                                                    Industry Report       

                                                    
 
Valuation  
Our  price  target  of  $22  is  based  on  12x  our  CY12  EPS  forecast  of  $1.80,  a  slight  PEG  premium  of  1.0x  versus 
comparable 0.9x, which we believe is appropriate as it reflects what we view as superior growth and margin potential. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  key  risks  for  Fairchild  Semiconductor  include  the  following:  1)  The  market  for  power  semiconductors  is  highly 
competitive, and it faces competition from established companies 2) Given the high unit volume manufacturing intensity of 
the  power  semiconductor  market,  the  company  remains  exposed  to  pricing  pressure  if  unit  demand  weakens  and 
manufacturing utilization declines; 3) Execution risk remains as the company shifts its mix to higher margin analog and 
mixed-signal products where the company has not historically competed. 
 
 
Fortinet Inc.  (NASDAQ: FTNT, $26.86, Buy, Price Target: $29)  
Dan Cummins | 212-468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe Fortinets growth opportunity in network security and focused capabilities can enable the company to continue 
to competing favorably and expand  its addressable  markets over the next several  years. We expect Fortinet to take 
market share in the roughly $4 billion global market for unified threat management (UTM) and next-generation firewall and 
VPN  technologies.  We  believe  Fortinets  strategy  and  investment  opportunity  will  grow  to  include  larger  market 
opportunities beyond a current core UTM market. Despite rapid success in channel-driven UTM over the past ten years, 
the company has resisted temptation to dilute its focus and chase adjacent market opportunities. Now, as a scale leader 
in its core market, we believe Fortinet has options for new addressable markets, with notable early success (e.g. carrier-
level, global enterprise) and presence in Gbps-speed packet inspection appliances. In late April, Fortinet made a small, 
technology focused acquisition which we believe can improve the companys capabilities to protect voice-over-IP traffic, a 
strong growth category in data services.    
 
Valuation  
We base our $29 price target on a FCF per share multiple of 31x our revised FY12 FCF/share estimate of $0.95, in line 
with the current 31x based on our revised 2011E FCF estimate of $0.84. The security group peer median FCF multiple is 
currently  23x.  We  believe  investors  will  continue  to  pay  a  premium  multiple  for  the  company's  ability  to  potentially 
outperform estimates. Accordingly, we believe a 31x multiple is appropriate.     
 
Risks to Price Target   
Competitive   landscape   is  tough:  scale  and  specialist   vendors,   and  dynamic  technology.  Fortinet   competes   with 
significantly larger companies, including Cisco and others. HP and IBM also possess notable assets in networking security 
as a result of acquisitions, and can price aggressively in order to box out competitors, we believe. The overall UTM market 
is fragmented, with nearly 40% of revenue market share for unified threat management held by mostly private, subscale 
firms. Private competitors also compete aggressively with new technological approaches to networking security, and could 
soon prove to be as disruptive.

Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX, $29.65, Buy, Price Target: $36)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
Strong OEM endorsements from HPQ/ORCL and at least three new potential near-term revenue drivers: 1) new tier-1 
Storage  back-end  interconnects  expected  in  2H11;  2)  new  ORCL  clustered  appliances  targeting  Enterprise  Apps,  in 
addition to Exadata and Exalogic; 3) and HPQ's recent broadening of scope of HPC BU to include web2.0/Cloud verticals, 
strengthen our conviction in MLNX fundamentals. Additionally, given, in our view, its strong engineering talent base, its 
excellent execution capabilities and now its end-to-end product portfolio encompassing IB/ Ethernet and silicon/ adaptors/ 
switches, the company is likely to continue benefitting disproportionately from trends that are converging requirements in 
its historically strong HPC market and the Cloud. We believe MLNX's strength lies in its strong engineering talent base 
and its superior execution of its vision, which we believe are strong sustainable competitive advantages.    
 
Valuation  
Our price target for MLNX shares is $36, which is based on a 20x P/E multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.68 and 
$2.45 per share cash. We believe a 20x P/E multiple is appropriate as it reflects a PEG ratio of 1x on our assumption of 
an earnings growth rate of 20%. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Mellanox is a component supplier to powerful OEMs that enjoy pricing leverage and are likely to change order patterns 
rapidly, which may affect revenue visibility for MLNX. Although Mellanox has enjoyed a virtual monopoly in InfiniBand, 
serious competition in the form of QLogic has begun to emerge in the market. QLogic could potentially cause severe price 
competition in the future as it tries to gain market share from MLNX. With the acquisition of VOLT, the InfiniBand market 
has become a two-horse race, in our view. If OEMs determine that they need to dual source their InfiniBand adaptors, 
QLGC could gain significant share in the market.  Additionally, customer inertia may prevent InfiniBand from moving 
beyond its current niche of High Performance Computing. 
 
 
NetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP, $51.97, Buy, Price Target: $65)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
A strong storage-optimization based product positioning especially in virtual-server related storage deployments, ramping 
distribution and sales presence, and increasing penetration into the enterprise have, in our view, enabled NetApp to gain 
significant market share over the past year. We expect these growth-drivers to continue driving share gains for NetApp 
and solidify its recently-achieved No.2 position in the storage market. We are also encouraged by the upward reset in 
operating margin target from 16% to north of 18%. We also view the Engenio takeout as positive for NTAP given our belief 
that it fills a fairly large hole in NTAP's portfolio in terms of a high-performance controller-based storage system and 
inexpensive price. This signals a departure from NTAP's historical product strategy of leveraging "common-operating-
system-on-commodity-hardware" but in our view is a necessary step as NTAP expands beyond its core mid-range-storage 
segment into higher performance-sensitive workloads, we estimate an incremental $5B TAM by 2014. We expect NTAP to 
leverage its channel to drive strong revenue synergies for Engenio and NTAP's existing portfolio. We believe NTAP is 
likely to show significant operating leverage and exit FY11 with operating margins significantly higher than the targeted 
range.  We  believe  this  positions  the  company  to  report  results  ahead  of  current  consensus  estimates  in  upcoming 
quarters. Considering our belief that NTAP is strongly positioned in the strongest storage growth markets, is gaining 
significant share at scale and has seen a significant reset in its earning power, we believe there is material potential 
upside in NTAP stock at current levels.   
 
Valuation  
Our price target of $65 is based on an ex-cash 21x multiple to our CY12 EPS estimate of $2.70 and net cash per share of 
$8.58. This implies a PEG ratio of 1.05, assuming a long-term growth rate of 20%, which we believe is appropriate based 
on, in our view, superior positioning in the fastest growing mid-market storage segment.

Risks to Price Target   
NetApp is exposed to the global macroeconomic slowdown, as are all other storage majors. Given its broad storage 
product and  geographical  footprint,  NetApp is exposed to  the  global economic slowdown  as much as all other large 
storage system vendors. Historically, strong Financial Services concentration could be a source of revenue risk. NetApp 
has historically generated about 10-15% of its revenue from the Financial Services vertical. The company generates about 
40% of its revenues overseas and is, therefore, subject to above-average foreign currency risk. Competition is becoming 
more intense all the time. We believe that competition from the large system vendors is bound to increase in a downturn.   
 
 
OPNET Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPNT, $38.82, Buy, Price Target: $43)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We characterize OPNETs opportunity as enterprise ITs efforts upgrade application performance monitoring (APM), in 
order to meet the challenges of complexity and network diversity among a new generation of process-driven enterprise 
applications. We believe OPNET will continue to raise its competitive profile in strategic APM, while taking share from a 
range of larger incumbents. We expect OPNET to reap the benefits of recent and focused efforts to expand and improve 
the  capabilities  of  its  sales function,  in  order  to  match  up  with  OPNETs  native  depth  in  packet  network  design  and 
protocols, application troubleshooting, and in heterogeneous application architectures.    
 
Valuation   
Our $43 per-share price target is based on a P/FCF multiple of 27x based on our FY13E FCF estimate of $1.57 (+43% 
yr/yr). OPNT shares currently trade at 35x our FY12E FCF per share estimate of $1.10. We believe investors will continue 
to  pay  a  high  multiple  of  earnings  for  OPNT  shares  in  anticipation  of  strong  revenue  growth  and  margin  accretion. 
Accordingly, we believe a 27x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  Network  instrumentation  market  is  fragmented,  and  competition  amongst  existing  vendors  could  be  a  source  of 
margin compression. Large players could develop their own solutions and infringe upon OPNET's turf. OPNET occupies a 
niche in the broader Network Management space. The niche does not have a large vendor in this space. We believe that 
continued macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to a larger portion of deals getting consummated over longer cycles, 
hence, delaying revenue recognition. 
 
 
Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL, $32.60, Buy, Price Target: $40)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe Oracle today exerts greater global account control than ever, resulting in share gains of customers IT budgets 
and a stronger ability to enter new markets. Supplemented by its successful acquisition strategy, Oracle has attained the 
#1 market share position in both the database and middleware markets, and a #2 position in the application software 
market.  Because  this  stack  is  increasingly  based  on  industry  standards  for  programming  and  exposing  data,  the 
marketplace is gravitating toward Oracle's offerings over those of second-tier providers, in our view.  Additionally, ORCL 
has only reported a full-year EPS decline once in the last 12 years (and even then, only 4%), and we believe ORCL's 
earnings resiliency has improved, as recurring maintenance revenue comprises 50% of revenue, versus 37% in FY02, 
and Oracle is advantaged by greater economies of scale today. In our view, this earnings resiliency and earnings growth 
that are more attractive to that of the S&P 500 deserve a premium valuation rather than a discount or market-average 
valuation, and we believe this equilibrium will be restored over time.   
 
Valuation   
On a CY: 2011E P/E basis, ORCL trades at 14.5x our CY: 2011 estimate of $2.28, which is essentially in line with the 
S&P  500  group  average  of  14.0x.  Our  $40  price  target  for  ORCL  shares  is based  on  a  15x multiple  applied  to  our 
CY:2012 EPS estimate of $2.52/share + $1.87 net cash per share. We believe that ORCL maintains essentially a similar 
valuation multiple for its out-year and believe this multiple is appropriate since, historically, ORCL shares have traded at a

slight premium to the market, and we expect the shares to continue to trade at a multiple that is in line with the historical 
level. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks  to  our  price  target  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  1)  Prolonged  weakness  in  IT  spending;  2)  macroeconomic 
fluctuations;  3)  acquisition  integration  challenges;  4)  competition;  5)  departure  of  key  management  personnel  could 
impede our price target. 
 
 
QUALCOMM Inc.  (NASDAQ: QCOM, $56.52, Buy, Price Target: $75)  
Mark McKechnie | 415-249-1988 | mmckechnie@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We view QCOM as the best large-cap semi play on smart phones and tablets with longer-term EPS power in the $4.00-
plus range. Our positive stance on QCOM is based on strong positioning in smart phones, market expansion into tablets 
and PCs (Windows8 ARM), with chipset share gains at Apple (iPhone5) and Nokia (WindowsPhone7) providing potential 
upside to our forecasts.  While we view the broad PC and Handset industries as cyclical, we estimate 35-40% growth in 
the coveted "gap" between the two: smart phones and tablets. We expect QCOM to benefit from 1) higher chip content as 
processing power/connectivity increases across mobile devices and 2) better royalties as 3G/4G moves upstream into 
tablets. We forecast unit growth of approximately 20% for CY11 and 15% for CY12 for QCOM's CDMA/WCDMA/LTE 
handset markets in aggregate, with an incremental 5-10% upside from tablets.  Our $75 target is based on 22x our FY12 
EPS estimate and does not include $13.09 in net cash per share.  Accordingly, we continue to include QCOM on our 
Conviction list.   
 
Valuation   
Our QCOM $75 price target is based on 22x our FY12 (September) EPS estimate of $3.40 and does not include $13.09 
per share in net cash. We justify the multiple on 1) our view of QCOM's leading royalty and chip position in smart phones, 
2) what we see as near-term potential upside from increased chips share with the iPhone5 and NOK's WindowsPhone7, 
and 3) what we see as potential upside from SnapDragon tablet wins. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target include: 1) Slower-than-anticipated industry unit growth; 2) Faster erosion of handset average 
selling prices; 3) Increased chip competition; and 4) general compression of market multiples.    
 
 
RightNow Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: RNOW, $29.77, Buy, Price Target: $38)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our recent survey work indicates the marketplace momentum of replacing legacy, single-channel on premise Customer 
Experience  solutions  with  multi-channel  cloud  based  solutions  is  accelerating  compared  to  six  month  ago.  We  think 
RNOW will benefit disproportionately from this replacement cycle since RightNow Technologies is the farthest along in 
building an Enterprise-scale cloud-based Customer Experience suite of solutions for large B2C businesses, in our view.  
Additionally, RightNows business model is positively levered to the mobile tsunami trend due to its volume-based usage 
pricing  model.  These  strong  market  tailwinds  plus  reported  TTM  current  software  backlog  growth  of  27%  gives  us 
confidence that new business and cash flow trends are accelerating, and we maintain a positive bias to current consensus 
expectations.  We believe the shares could appreciate through either higher estimate revisions or multiple expansion as 
the current discount valuation to the SaaS group average narrows over time.    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 price target is based on approximately 27x our EV/2012E OCF of $48M (cash from operations), which is a slight 
discount to the current average SaaS companies' EV/FTM OCF estimated multiple of 29. We use a 27 multiple to derive 
our price target, as we expect the shares to trade at a multiple that is essentially in line with the SaaS group average.

Riverbed Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: RVBD, $40.17, Buy, Price Target: $48)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are impressed by the company's material beat despite significant concerns related to Japan and US Federal markets. 
While these concerns are likely to persist into 2QFY11, we expect RVBD's momentum in other markets to offset any 
weakness in Japan and US Federal. Our checks suggest a strong pipeline for RVBD's core WAN optimization solution, 
ramping cross-sell opportunities for Network Monitoring solutions, and nascent interest in new Cloud offerings. We are 
also  encouraged  by  our  checks  in  Europe,  which  suggest  strong  momentum  for  RVBD  despite  likely  recent  sales 
leadership changes. While we believe consolidation of infrastructure within and across datacenters and branch offices is a 
strong secular trend that is likely to continue driving RVBD's core WAN optimization market, we believe the compelling 
economics of Cloud Backup Storage could potentially see broader adoption begin in CY11, which could cause another leg 
of growth for RVBD in the near future.     
 
Valuation  
We base our $48 price target on a P/E of 37.5x (ex cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.20 and a PEG ratio of 1.25. 
This is a premium multiple given our long-term earnings growth rate assumption of 30%, and we assume a PEG greater 
than 1 to reflect the company's leadership position in a high growth and what we believe is an underpenetrated market 
opportunity. Accordingly, we believe a premium multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
Larger vendors with greater access to resources may compete more vigorously than we expect. Larger vendors may 
develop  competing  products  or  acquire  the  remaining  private  vendors,  thus  becoming  a  greater  threat  to  Riverbed's 
market leadership. Riverbed may hire new employees more aggressively than we anticipate, thus limiting the operating 
margin and EPS potential.

We   view   Spansion   as   the   leader   in   the   embedded   NOR  flash   memory  market   for   diversified   end   markets   in 
industrial/automotive,  telecom/networking,  computing  and  consumer  electronics.  Since  emerging  from  bankruptcy,  we 
believe that Spansion has executed well in regaining share in the embedded flash market with consistent revenue growth, 
higher margins, and free cash flow using its proprietary MirrorBit flash memory technology and a "FabLite" manufacturing 
strategy. Spansion has what we view as: a diversified customer base of over 4,000 global customers, good design win 
momentum, a focused new management team, a flexible Fab Lite manufacturing strategy and recent strong revenue and 
earnings growth.   
 
Valuation   
Our $25 price target is based on an approximate 11x P/E on our calendar 2011E pro forma EPS of $2.30 relative to our 
outlook for 12% secular earnings growth. Given the consolidation in the NOR industry likely leading to more stable pricing 
with Spansion and Micron technology being the two main competitors in the high-performance embedded NOR flash 
market, strong demand drivers currently in the embedded NOR market, technology leadership, and good management 
execution,  we  believe  that  a  forward  multiple  of  11x  on  our  calendar  2011E  EPS  is  justified  relative  to  Spansion's 
expected secular earnings growth outlook.

                                                                                                    Industry Report        

                                                    
 
Risks to Price Target  
The  following  risks  are  inherent  to  investing  in  Spansion:  general  business  and  economic  conditions;  demand  for 
products; changes in customer order patterns; the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks. In addition, Spansion's recent emergence from Chapter 11 implies that 
the company has to re-engage and win back new and existing customers who may not have a business relationship. 
Spansion also has to rapidly transition to a "Fab Lite" flexible, manufacturing strategy of using its captive Fab in Austin, 
coupled with foundries such as Elpida, SMIC etc. Additionally, Spansion still has significant debt load which may constrain 
its operational flexibility; especially in weak economic times.     
 
 
Ultra Clean Holdings Inc.  (NASDAQ: UCTT, $8.38, Buy, Price Target: $20)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis    
We believe Ultra Clean Holdings is well-positioned for long-term growth as a leading provider of gas delivery systems and 
outsourced  manufacturing  of  larger  subsystems  for  the  semiconductor,  flat  panel,  solar/LED,  medical,  and  research 
capital equipment industry. UCTT has a history of consistent growth and profitability. Key factors for potential growth in 
our view include higher-level subsystems outsourced manufacturing, diversification into related markets, and a focus on 
expansion in Asia. Ultra Clean has a blue-chip list of customers in our view, within the semiconductor capital equipment 
industry.  In  addition,  the  company  is  diversifying  into  non-semiconductor  capital  equipment  manufacturing,  flat  panel 
displays, and medical robotics equipment.  
 
Valuation   
Our price target of $20 is based on a 13x P/E on our estimated CY12 EPS of $1.55 relative to our outlook for 15% secular 
earnings growth (87% PEG). We believe that a conservative PEG ratio of 87% is appropriate for a cyclical outsourced 
manufacturing  services  company  such  as  UCTT,  which  has  a  relatively  concentrated  customer  base,  prospects  for 
moderate revenue growth of 10% to 15% per year, and limited long-term visibility on orders and business trends, in our 
view. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks  to  our  UCTT  price  target  include  the  cyclical  outsourced  manufacturing  services  strategy  with  a  relatively 
concentrated  customer  base,  prospects  for  moderate  revenue  growth  of  10  to  15%  per  year,  and  limited  long-term 
visibility on orders and business trends. The following risks are inherent in a diversified semiconductor company: general 
business and economic conditions; demand for products; customer concentration, changes in customer order patterns; 
changes in outsourced manufacturing strategy, the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks.

Active Network Inc. (NYSE: ACTV, $18.58, Buy, Price Target: $23)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Active is a leading provider of cloud-based reservation and marketing solutions serving a variety of customer groups, 
including  business  events,  community  activities,  outdoors,  and  sports.  Our  Buy  rating  is  based  on:  1)  strong  growth 
potential  in  an  underpenetrated  $10B  North  American  technology  fee  opportunity,  2)  Active  provides  a  strong  value 
proposition to both organizations and consumers, 3) numerous growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term 
growth, and 4) attractive financial characteristics with highly predictable revenues and high incremental EBITDA margins.  
Accordingly, we add ACTV to our Conviction Buy list.   
 
Valuation   
We arrive at a $23 per-share price target for Active based on 26x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $53.5M. We believe a 26x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35% plus long-term EBITDA growth, and 30% and 63% EBITDA growth in 2011 and 
2012. Our price target also equates to 22x our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $75.7M, discounted back to 2012 at 12%.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks for Active Network include risks of integrating acquisitions; competition; slower adoption of web-based reservation 
systems; the macroeconomic environment; transition to the ActiveWorks platform; expansion into new businesses and 
risks surrounding International expansion.   
 
 
Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU, $138.94, Buy, Price Target: $175)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
We  remain  positive  on  BIDU  shares,  and  expect  continued  strong  growth  driven  by  1)  continued  consumer  Internet 
adoption  we expect China to add another 70 million Internet users in 2011 up from approximately 450M at the end of 
2010 (33% online penetration); 2) continued merchant adoption  we estimate Baidu has approximately 5% market share 
among  its  addressable  market  of  5 million  larger  SMEs  in  China;  3)  strong  growth  in  emerging  categories  including 
eCommerce; 4) continued monetization improvements. We believe these factors should lead to 60% plus top-line growth 
in 2011 and we expect continued strong incremental margins which we expect to lead to 70% plus EPS growth.    
 
Valuation   
Our $175 price target for BIDU shares is based on a 45x P/E to our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $3.88. We believe a 45x 
multiple is justified given our outlook for 40%-plus long-term EPS growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Key risks for Baidu include an economic slowdown in China, increased regulatory action, increased competition, and lack 
of a developed eCommerce market.    
 
 
comScore Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR, $26.45, Buy, Price Target: $36)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
comScore  is  a  leading  provider  of  audience  measurement  tools  and  related  marketing  intelligence,  in  our  view.  The 
company offers its products and solutions to agencies, marketers, and online publishers via a combination of subscription 
products (~85% of total revenue; subscription services are sold on annual basis and retention rates have historically 
exceeded  90%) and customized,  project-based engagements (~15% of revenue). Over the past  year, comScore has 
demonstrated  significant  Y/Y  growth  acceleration  in  net  customer  additions  (a  key  indicator  of  the  companys  future 
revenue prospects), driven by an improving ad spending environment and strong demand for the companys enhanced 

                                                                                                                         
 

                                                                                                              Page 11

                                                                                                        July 13, 2011  
                                                                                                  Industry Report       

                                                   
 
audience  measurement  technology,  Media  Metrix  360,  based  on  a  hybrid  panel-and-census  measurement  approach. 
While  we  expect  continued  strong  net  customer  additions  in  2011,  we  believe  that  the  key  driver  for  comScores 
fundamentals and stock performance over the next 6-12 months will be growth in revenue per customer, which we expect 
to be driven by generally deepening engagement with customers, and particularly by increasing traction for the companys 
Digital  Analytix  Web  analytics  suite  and  the  companys  ad  effectiveness  measurement  solutions.  We  believe  that  a 
significant  acceleration  in  project  revenue  growth  witnessed  beginning  in  3Q10  is  an  early  indication  of  a  trend  of 
increasing ARPU which we expect to continue through 2011. Heading into 2012, we expect the companys continuing 
development of its new product pipeline to serve as a further catalyst for company fundamentals. Based on these key 
catalysts, we believe the company is likely to generally outperform consensus expectations, drive increased operating 
leverage into 2012, and garner an expanding valuation multiple over the next 12-24 months. 
 
Valuation   
Our $36 price target is based on 14x our FY12 EBITDA estimate of $74.5M. We believe 14x FY12 EBITDA represents an 
appropriate discount to SaaS peers, given SCOR's exposure to risks associated with the advertising market and the 
broader consumer economy.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential  risks  include  customer  concentration,  competition,  or  potential  long-term  changes  in  media-buying  behavior 
(e.g., the shift to user-targeted online advertising), among others.   
 
 
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY, $32.26, Buy, Price Target: $38)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe factors that could lead to outperformance for eBay shares include continued improved performance of the U.S. 
Marketplace  and  strong  growth  for  PayPal.  We  expect  the  Marketplace  business  to  benefit  from  an  anticipated 
continuation of an improved user experience, growth from larger and top-rated sellers, and an increased mix of fixed price 
sales and stable auction sales. We note that ChannelAdvisor also recently indicated eBay's April marketplace growth of 
10.9%  (up  from  4.9%  in  1Q)  and  we  note  eBay  is  benefiting  from  a  higher  mix  of  fixed  price  sales,  improved  user 
experience  such  as  Parts  &  Accessories,  and  strength  from  larger  merchants.  For  2011,  we  estimate  U.S.  GMV  to 
accelerate to 9% Y/Y vs. 4% Y/Y in 2010.  We expect Payments growth to remain robust in 2011 driven by increasing 
penetration on eBay, continued robust Merchant Services growth driven by global expansion and increased merchant 
share, growth of PayPal for digital goods platform, and 4) growth of mobile payments  PayPal expects to triple mobile 
TPV from $750M in 2010 to over $2B in 2011.  We estimate 26% Y/Y Payments revenue growth for 2011 (low 20's FX 
neutral).    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 EBAY price target is based on approximately 14.4x our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $2.24 plus cash, which we 
believe is appropriate given our outlook of 5-10% long-term growth for the marketplace business and 15-20% long-term 
growth for the payment business. For our price target, we apply a 12x multiple to Marketplace 2012E PF EPS, a 20x 
multiple to Payments 2012E EPS, and add $6 in cash/investments, which equates to our $38 PT. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Key risks for eBay include competition, adverse currency movements, inability to improve eBay's user experience, and 
economic weakness.

Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS, $24.17, Buy, Price Target: $28)    
Atul Bagga | 415-249-6362 | abagga@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are positive on ERTS's proposed acquisition of PopCap, given growth in social and smartphone games that was faster 
than  we  had  expected;  better  than  we  expected  EPS  accretion  from  the  deal;  the  quality  of  PopCap  assets;  and  a 
potential to accelerate growth in higher-quality Games-as-a-Service business.  We are raising our estimates and  now 
expect EPS growth at 21% Y/Y and 39% Y/Y EPS during FY12 and FY13 respectively, driven largely by growing revenue 
contribution from relatively lucrative Games-as-a-Service segment. 
 
Valuation 
Our $28 price target on ERTS shares is based on a 26x PE (net of cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.82 versus a 13x 
average  for  the  shares  of  the  peer  group. We  think  that  the  premium  is  appropriate,  given  that  we  believe  that  the 
company  has strong franchises and the  potential to monetize these franchises on emerging platforms and given the 
company's focus on the faster-growing Games-as-a-Service segment.    
 
Risks to Price Target 
Gaming  continues  to  be  a  hit-or-miss-driven  business,  and  predicting  successful  titles  versus  unsuccessful  titles  is 
extremely difficult. The risk is especially high for the new and unproven IPs, and a company's reliance on the new IPs and 
the titles in the established franchises to reach the revenue target opens it to risk of a revenue miss. Additionally, we 
believe there are macro headwinds given the increasing popularity of the used games and free-to-play online games.   
 
 
Velti PLC (NASDAQ: VELT, $18.70, Buy, Price Target: $22)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Velti is, in our view, a leading provider of mobile marketing and mobile advertising technology solutions. We believe the 
company is well positioned to benefit from rapid growth in demand for mobile marketing/advertising in the coming years, 
which  we  believe  should  drive  complementary  demand  for  technology  solutions  which  make  mobile  marketing  and 
advertising  campaigns  more  targetable,  effective,  and  accountable.  While  we  expect  the  companys  core  market 
opportunity to grow at a 30%+ CAGR over the next five years, we believe that Velti could grow even faster, based on: 1) a 
focus on marketing solutionswe believe the company faces a richer and less competitive opportunity than peers focused 
solely on mobile advertising; 2) a flexible business model and end-to-end technology platform that allow the company to 
align  incentives  with  customers  and  provide  seamless  solutions  to  address  marketers  needs  across  the  consumer 
lifecycle; and 3) a strong management team and reputation in the marketplace. Regarding the potential performance of 
VELT shares, we note that 1) we have a high degree of confidence in the companys fundamental performance; 2) the 
company represents a unique asset in the public markets in our view; 3) we believe the company could become a takeout 
candidate, based on the historical record of M&A activity in the space; and 4) shares appear to us to be attractively valued 
at approximately 11x FY12E EV/EBITDA.   
 
Valuation 
We note that shares of interactive marketing services peers currently trade at an average FY11E EV/EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 10x, while SaaS companies currently trade at an average of 23x FY11E EV/EBITDA. Given the company's 
growing SaaS revenue streams and what we view as its superior growth and long-term margin prospects, we believe 
VELT shares should trade toward the higher end of the 10-23x range. Accordingly, we apply a 20x multiple against or 
2011E EBITDA estimate of $54.1M to derive our $22 12-month price target.   
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target  include the  very early stage of development of the mobile marketing/advertising technology 
opportunity, customer/category concentration, geographic risk, ongoing development of internal controls, working capital 
requirements, competition, and the high degree of seasonality present in the business.

WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ: WBMD, $47.00, Buy, Price Target: $66)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We remain positive on WBMD shares, and expect another solid year of growth for WebMD in 2011 driven by 1) continued 
online migration of health related advertising  we estimate only mid-single digit online share today for the healthcare 
vertical; 2) continued consumer adoption health related web information which we believe should drive solid page view 
growth of approximately 15% in 2011; 3) continued operating leverage  we expect 53% incremental EBITDA margins in 
2011.  We believe these factors should lead to 17% plus top-line growth in 2011 and 28% plus EBITDA growth.    
 
Valuation 
Our $66 price target is based on a 12x multiple of our 2012E EBITDA of $279M plus net cash and investments and 
present value of NOLs. Historically, shares of Internet companies with similar business models, growth rates, and cash 
flow characteristics to WebMD have traded in the 10-15x forward-year EBITDA forecast range. Given those comparisons 
as a backdrop, we believe that our use of an EV/EBITDA multiple of 12xnear the mid point of the rangeis appropriate, 
given the company's solid fundamentals and what we view as its "premier" status among Internet publishers. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks include deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook, weakening of the advertising market, market share shift to 
lower-priced  online  advertising  alternatives  (e.g.,  health-oriented  vertical  advertising  and  content  networks),  and  the 
potential  for  incremental  regulation  further  limiting  the  ability  of  pharmaceutical  companies  to  market  directly  to 
consumers, among others.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY, $9.75, Buy, Price Target: $18)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
ALNY presented what we view as encouraging ALN-VSP01 data at ASCO and will seek a development partner prior to 
initiating Phase 2 trials. For the remainder of 2011, we believe additional important catalysts will include clinical data for 
ALN-TTR (3Q11), and ALN-PCS (4Q11). We believe investors could benefit from potential 2011 drivers in the context of a 
marginal cash burn (we estimate at $1.26 per share). We reiterate our Buy rating and $18 price target.    
 
2H11 Drivers: We believe the next two years (and especially 2H11) will show two additional important pipeline proof of 
concept (POC) data sets that we expect could drive shares significantly from current levels. In 3Q11, ALNY plans to 
announce Phase 1 POC data for ALN-TTR01 in TTR Amyloidosis. The trial's primary goal is to evaluate safety, but it also 
includes secondary end points the Street should find meaningful, such as ALN-TTR treatment's effect on circulating TTR 
plasma levels measured as percentage (%) lowering of TTR from pretreatment/baseline TTR levels. Our TTR consultants 
would be encouraged to observe 10-20% plasma TTR reductions while they believe up to 50% is also possible in this trial. 
They generally believe a 50% plasma TTR reduction is enough to cause TTR plaque regression or slow progression of 
the disease by 50% (factor of 2). By YE11, we believe ALN-PCS data for hypercholesterolemia patients should become 
available. ALNY has not yet specified the end points for this trial, but we believe it is also committed to measuring efficacy 
in a manner that would be appreciated by the Street. In 2011, ALNY further plans to disclose two additional pipeline 
programs. In 2012, ALNY plans to enter ALN-ALN-HTT for Huntington's Disease and ALN-HPN for refractory anemia into 
the clinic.    
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $18 is based on a sum-of-parts analysis by estimating YE11 cash (12-month forward) at 
approximately $8-9 per share and adding $9 per share ($410M) in pipeline technology value. Risks include IP litigation; 
delivery failures; clinical, regulatory, and competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and extended timelines to potential 
profitability.

Risks to Price Target  
ALNYs  lead  product  candidates  appear  to  be  at  least  a  few  years  from  market  and  may  face  significant  clinical, 
regulatory, and competitive risks. Additionally, IP litigation and failure to make advances in RNAi delivery could lead to 
extended timelines to potential profitability. We also anticipate significant changes to the marketplace as new medicines 
are  introduced.  To  reiterate,  primary  investment  risks  include  IP  litigation;  delivery  failures;  clinical,  regulatory,  and 
competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and future financing risk. 
 
 
Dendreon Corp. (NASDAQ: DNDN, $38.49, Buy, Price Target: $55)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our 40 U.S. physician survey provides a foundation for our Provenge near term launch expectations and longer term peak 
sales potential by scenario analysis of the potential impact of Abiraterone and MDV-3100. Our most conservative scenario 
relative to Provenge leads us to a $50 12-month price target. Less conservative scenarios lead to a price target as high as 
$67. If the 2011 Provenge sales ramp falls short of Street expectations, we would take advantage of any weakness as our 
longer term robust survey-predicted peak sales estimate provides downside protection, in our view.    
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $55 is based on a discounted EPS valuation analysis. Our $55 PT is based on 25x our fully 
taxed/diluted FY14 EPS estimate of $3.85 discounted annually back to mid-2012 at 25%. Our PE multiple is in line with 
shares of high-growth biotechnology companies, and we believe the discount rate is appropriate for a company with late-
stage therapeutic candidates for orphan indication.    
 
Risks to Price Target  
Central to our thesis and current valuation is DNDN's execution related to ramping up Provenge sales. Near term, there is 
risk  of  DNDN  successfully  training  additional  physicians  on  use  and  treatment  of  Provenge,  increase  manufacturing 
capacity including regulatory plant approvals, streamline reimbursement and physician education related to Provenge. 
Longer term, DNDN will need to successfully mitigate E.U. manufacturing facility build out, regulatory challenges and 
launch of the drug. Over the next 12 months, we foresee the major near-term risk in DNDN relating to it achieving its 2011 
Provenge revenue guidance, with near 50% of those revenues expected in 4Q11. We do not expect reporting of these 
Provenge revenues until early 2012, either at an investor conference or quarterly earnings call.    
 
 
NuVasive Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA, $32.18, Buy, Price Target: $39)    
Sameer Harish | 415-249-1989 | sharish@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We  expect  NuVasive  to  benefit  from  the  increased  interest  in  minimally  invasive  and  lateral  spine  surgery  and  to 
increasingly promote their nerve monitoring system, advanced retractors, and market leading suite of lateral implants. A 
significant part of NuVasive's growth and margin strategy circles around sales force leverage, we believe. Over half of the 
sales reps have been with NuVasive for less than two years and are just starting to reach their target productivity. Further, 
we  expect  NuVasive  to  focus  on  advanced  physician  training  to  expand  utilization  and  procedure  breadth  amongst 
surgeons to take advantage of newly introduced products such as XLIF Thoracic, NuVasive TLIF, and procedures using 
multi-level constructs. Operating leverage will also be driven by sale force maturation, as well as an expanding product 
offering, and fixed cost  efficiencies,  in  our  view. Thus we expect Street  estimates for NUVA  will  increase over time. 
Notably,  the  company  recently  increased  guidance  for  2011  citing  improved  visibility  and  physician  reimbursement 
conversion rates for cases under appeal, all contribution to a stronger U.S. lumbar outlook. We also expect NuVasive to 
launch several new products in the near-to-mid term. NuVasive is developing disc replacement devices including the PCM 
cervical disc system, XL total disc replacement (TDR), and NeoDisc cervical disc replacement device. Progentix is a new 
synthetic biologic that we expect to gain FDA approval during 2011. We believe NuVasive will maintain a sustainable 
competitive advantage for growth with its proprietary technologies, and strong pipeline products.

Valuation   
Our $39 price target is based upon 3x our 2012 revenue estimate of $602.9 million. This is a discount to the comparable 
medtech companies' averages of 3.8x 2012 revenues. NuVasive shares are trading at 1.8x our 2012 revenues and 2.1x 
our 2011 revenues of $532.8 million, compared to the medtech companies'' average of 3.9x 2011 revenues. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
NuVasive   operates   in   a   highly   competitive   and   dynamic   industrynew   technology   and   innovation   from   other 
organizations  may  change  NuVasives  ability  to  successfully  grow  in  their  markets  and  may  make  the  companys 
technology  obsolete. Additional  near-term risks include pricing  or reimbursement pressures, slowing market for spine 
surgery, timing and/or loss of orders to large hospital or physician groups, clinical guideline changes, delays in regulatory 
filings and supply and manufacturing disruptions.

Ceradyne Inc.  (NASDAQ: CRDN, $36.21, Buy, Price Target: $60)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe CRDN is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward increased applications of advanced 
ceramics in the industrial and energy market due to lightweight, heat, and wear advantages versus incumbent materials. 
Near term, we believe the company is getting better yield on its military business as it more effectively meets product 
specs. Second, the company is getting better utilization of its manufacturing assets having closed two facilities in 2010 
and getting better utilization as revenue increases. Third, the company's mix of products is migrating to higher margin 
opportunities in solar and industrial applications. We believe these three drivers will remain intact going forward. We are 
also encouraged by the company's investment in additional Boron separation capacity this year along with the accelerated 
traction of its Petrochem and bioglass products. We believe CRDN's improving product mix and end-market exposure are 
sufficient to drive material growth over the next several years.    
 
Valuation 
We give shares of CRDN a Buy rating and a price target of $60, based on 8x our EV/2012E EBITDA of $171M, in line with 
peers now that the company has realized its margin expansion potential. 
 
Risks to Price Target

Johnson Controls Inc.  (NYSE: JCI, $41.14, Buy, Price Target: $49)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We  continue  to  highlight  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  Cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification  of  the  transportation  market.  We  continue  to  believe  the  company's  Power  Solutions  and  Automotive 
Experience segments are positioned for improvement. We also continue to believe that the company is well positioned to 
benefit from multi-year revenue and margin growth in its Building Efficiency segment. In addition, we note that JCI's entry 
into the demand response (DR) market signals that the DR market is a large enough addressable opportunity to warrant 
investment and that the economics of DR contracts are likely to change substantially over time and move more toward 
commodity pricing. We believe that JCI's entry into the DR market may be driven in part by a desire to retain customers. 
We also note interest from global energy regulators. In the United States, we note that FERC's Order 745 sets up a 
framework for DR providers to receive Locational Marginal Pricing, while the TVA's recent Integrated Resource Plan has 
increased focus on Energy Efficiency and DR. The European Energy Commission's recent communication on its 2011

Energy Efficiency Plan states continued focus on Building Efficiency improvements. We also note statements from various 
news sources that Germany plans to increase its focus on Offshore Wind and Building Efficiency.   
 
Valuation  
We give shares of JCI a Buy rating and price target of $49, based on 15x our FY2012E EPS estimate of $3.27, a modest 
premium to diversified industrial peers due to our expectation for JCI to grow faster than peers. JCI is at a slight premium 
to shares of diversified industrial peers due to its exposure to strong growth markets and positive product mix shift, in our 
opinion.  We  also  view  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification of the transportation market.

Rogers Corp. (NYSE: ROG, $46.90, Buy, Price Target: $64)    
Shawn Severson | 415-249-1986 | sseverson@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We are of the belief that Rogers is only in the early stages of a multi-year growth story built on key applications in the 
cleantech,  Internet  and  mass  transit  markets.  We  think  many  of  the  company's  products  are  high  value  added 
components, yet account for a relatively small portion of the bill of materials. This is a very important distinction as it can 
provide some price protection and insulation from competition as commercial volumes scale in markets such as electric 
vehicles  and  smart  phones/tablets,  in  our  view.  We  think  the  current  valuation  provides  a  significant  opportunity  for 
investors to build a position and we expect multiple expansion and solid earnings growth to prevail over the coming 12 
months.   
 
Valuation  
Our price target for ROG shares is $64, based on a PE of 18x our FY12 EPS estimate of $3.43. Our target multiple is in 
line with the shares' average valuation since 2005. We believe the multiple expansion from the current level will be driven 
by investors recognizing what we view as strong secular megatrends developing for the company and the potential effect 
on earnings over the next three years. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Although we believe the company is likely to benefit from positive megatrends, the company is still likely to be sensitive to 
broader  economic  conditions.  As  was  displayed  clearly  during  the  financial  crisis  and  subsequent  recession,  ROG's 
products and, hence, revenues are subject to cyclical trends. As we have stated previously, we believe ROG has solid 
growth  opportunities in some key sectors, but this  would not be enough to offset a meaningful decline in the  global 
economy. Failure of key growth markets to materialize. Our investment thesis is dependent a couple key markets and any 
significant or permanent disruption in those markets could have a sustained negative effect on the shares. Specifically, the 
prospects for 4G deployment, rail infrastructure in developing countries, and the adoption rate of HEV/EV around the 
world.

CONSUMER  
 
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST, $80.71, Buy, Price Target: $90)  
Edward Weller | 415 249 1377 | eweller@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
With high gas prices and food inflation both intensifying the consumers usual quest for value, the combination of Costcos 
always  extremely  aggressive  pricing  and  what  appears  to  be  improving  customer  service  seem  to  us  to  be  driving 
increased frequency among existing members and new customer sign-ups, as well. Comp store customer traffic has been 
rising by 4% month after month for more than two years now and we believe that customers will continue to favor Costco 
for more of their purchases. Whats more, international operations (ex the UK business) seems to be firing on all cylinders 
and   an   incipient   recovery   in   Southern   California,   historically   Costcos   most   profitable   regions,   can   have   a 
disproportionately favorable impact on profitability for the next couple of years. We expect that ROIs will continue to rise, 
that  Costco  will  increase  its  growth  rate  and,  by  putting  more  capital  to  work  at  those  high  ROIs,  drive  increasing 
shareholder value. We reiterate our Buy on Costco.   
 
Valuation  
The rising valuations that we foresee in coming years derive directly from this recovery to normal  or recently normal  
returns, and those rising returns should drive richer valuations in our view. These generally rising returns, in combination 
with our estimates of slowly rising company investment suggest a price target a year from now of $90. (See our extensive 
valuation methodology in our report entitled  COST: Closes Quarter Strong, Recovery Still Building in Southern California , 
             th
dated May 18  , 2011.     
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential risks to our forecasts and to our estimates and price target for Costco include: yet a further general economic 
slowdown  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  or  other  region  important  to  the  company;  interruptions  in  merchandise 
availability; continued upward pressure on operating expenses; and greater-than-anticipated competitive pressures.

believe  margins  can  potentially  reach  30%  or  higher  longer  term.  We  expect
Active to be able to achieve scale efficiencies across most of its expense lines,
particularly COGS and R&D. We believe R&D spend should be able to decline
to a mid-teens rate (versus 22% in 2010) as Active rolls off its legacy platforms.
We  also  expect  significant  leverage  in  COGS  over  time,  benefiting  from  call
center integration, Web hosting scale, and moving to a self-serve model.

Investment Thesis  
 
Leadership Position in Underpenetrated Market.  We believe Active is the clear leader today in providing Web-based 
reservations in the four key verticals it serves today: sports, community activities, outdoors, and business events. As the 
market leader with the most scale (70 million reservations in 2010), we believe Active is able to invest significantly more 
resources than competitors in both its technology and marketing to organizations and consumers. Furthermore, Active 
estimates a North American Technology Fee market opportunity of $10B, indicating Active had less than 2.5% market 
share  in  2010.  Similarly,  Active  estimates  it  had  approximately  5%  of  North  American  customers  and  5%  of  total 
registrations in 2010. In total, we estimate that the market is approximately 10% penetrated online today. This compares 
to more mature markets in the United States, such as online travel reservations, which we estimate have over 50% online 
penetration.     
 
Strong Value Proposition for Organizations and Consumers.  We believe  Active Network provides a strong value 
proposition for both organizations (its customers) as well as consumers. Historically, many organizations have relied on 
paper-based systems or simple spreadsheet applications to manage events and registrations. Additionally, organizations 
typically have taken reservations by phone or walk-up registrations. For organizations, Active Network has developed an 
automated Web-based  platform  to  enable  organizations  to  manage  events  and  registrations  more  efficiently,  thereby 
saving resources and enabling the organization to focus on its core competencies of running the event. Actives solutions 
also enable an organization to attract additional participants and improve conversion rates. For instance, Active estimates 
that for the New York City Triathlon, it delivered a 469% ROI through both cost savings and additional revenues. For 
consumers, we believe the two key advantages of Actives platform are to discover new events through Actives directory 
as well as providing a fast Web-based solution for registering for events.   
 
Beneficiary of Network Effect. We believe Active is a clear beneficiary of the network effect, which we believe will 
enable Active to enjoy scale efficiencies over smaller competitors. We believe the network effect occurs as 1) Active adds 
new organizations, 2) the additional organizations lead to more participants to book online at either the organizations 
website or though one of Actives sites, and 3) the growth of registrations attracts new potential customers.

                                                                                                  Company Report           

                                                    
 
 
Highly Predictable Revenue Model.  In 2010, 85% of Actives revenues were technology based, for which the revenues 
are highly predictable. For its technology solutions, Active typically signs three-year contracts, and enjoys less than 5% 
annual  registration  revenue  churn,  which  we  believe  is  an  indication  of  the  high  ROI  it  delivers  to  organizations. 
Additionally,  while  most  revenues  are  transaction  based,  based  on  historical  events,  Active  has  strong  insights  into 
forward-booking trends.     
 
Multiple Growth Drivers Should Drive Mid-Teens Long-Term Revenue Growth.  We believe Active has numerous 
growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term revenue growth, including the following: 1) growth in the number of 
customers (approximately 5% today of market); 2) growth in online penetration (in its most mature Triathlon market, Active 
has 36% online penetration with participants versus 2% online penetration in total; 3) the ability to provide additional 
modules  to  customers  as  well  as  marketing  services  solutions;  4)  we  expect  Active  to  remain  acquisitive,  acquiring 
companies to bolster its market positions in current verticals, expand into additional verticals, or add additional technology 
solutions;  5)  expand  internationallywe  believe  the  international  opportunity  should  be  at  least  as  large  as  the  U.S. 
market, although it represents less than 3% of revenues today; 6) increase eCommerce offerings (i.e., Active recently 
launched Daily Deals [Schwaggle] for which it plans to launch in 25 cities by the end of 2011).  
 
Highly Scalable Model Should Lead to Significant EBITDA Margin Expansion and Growth. While EBITDA margins 
were just 9% in 2010, we believe margins can potentially reach 30% or higher longer term. We expect Active to be able to 
achieve  scale  efficiencies  across  most  of  its  expense  lines,  particularly  COGS  and  R&D.  In  particular,  we  note  that 
approximately 35% of Actives 2010 R&D spend was spent on legacy platforms. We believe R&D spend should be able to 
decline to a mid-teens rate as Active rolls off its legacy platforms.  We also expect significant leverage in COGS over time, 
benefiting from call center integration, Web hosting scale, and moving to a self-serve model.

Marketing Services Revenue. We estimate Marketing Services Revenues of $43.9M in 2011 and $51.3M in 2012, 
growth of 4.7% and 17.0%, respectively . The key drivers for marketing services include Online Services, Commerce, 
and Field Marketing. We expect Online Services to benefit from online advertising growth including email, search, and 
social. We expect Commerce to benefit from growth of membership programs, growth of registration platforms, and Daily 
Deals adoption (Schwaggle). We expect Field Services to benefit from the growth of access to events, activities, facilities, 
and consumers.    
 
Gross Margins.  Cost of revenues for Active consists of credit card processing fees, payroll and related costs, customer 
support and call center expenses, and amortization of capitalized software. We estimate gross margins of 57.4% in 2011 
and 59.1% in 2012, versus 56.6% in 2010. We expect gross margins to expand in both 2011 and 2012 driven by call 
center integration, scale in Web hosting, and the rollout of self set up. We believe gross margins can expand to the low 
60s longer term.    
 
Operating Expenses.  We expect total operating expense (excluding SBC) to remain relatively flat as a percentage of 
revenues in 2011 versus 2010 given public company costs and continued high levels of technology investments. We 
expect increased operating expense leverage in 2012 and beyond.      
 
   •   Sales and Marketing.  We expect Sales and Marketing expenses to account for 21.3% of revenue in 2011 and 
       20.3% in 2012 versus 20.9% in 2010. We expect Sales and Marketing to increase modestly as a percentage of 
       revenue in 2011 given significant investments in headcount. Longer term, we expect S&M expenses in the high-
       teens as a percentage of revenues.

    •   Research and Development.  We expect Research and Development expenses to account for 21.3% of revenue 
        in 2011 and 20.3% in 2012, versus 21.8% in 2010. We expect modest leverage in R&D in 2011 and increased 
        leverage in 2012 as the platform scales and investments in legacy platforms begins to decline. Longer term, we 
        expect R&D to represent approximately 15% of revenues.      
     
    •   General and Administrative.  We expect General and Administrative expenses to account for 13.6% of revenue 
        in 2011 and 13.5% in 2012, versus 13.6% in 2010. We expect G&A expenses to remain flat in 2011 despite 
        increased public company costs and then to decline as a percentage of revenue in 2012 and to decline to the 
        10% range longer term.

EBITDA.  We  expect  EBITDA  of  $32.8M  in  2011  and  $53.5M  in  2012,  representing  increases  of  30.2%  and  63.0%, 
respectively.  We  expect  just  modest  EBITDA  margin  leverage  in  2011  given  increased  public  company  costs,  and 
investments  in  S&M  and  the  ActiveWorks  platform. And  we  expect  increased  EBITDA  margin  leverage  in  2012  and 
beyond as Active benefits from scale efficiencies and legacy technology investments begin to decline.

Valuation 
 
We arrive at a $23 per-share price target for Active based on 26x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $53.5M. We believe a 26x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth, and 30% and 63% EBITDA growth in 2011 and 
2012, respectively. Our price target also equates to 22x our 2013 EBITDA estimate of $75.7M, discounted back to 2012 at 
12%.   
 
Our $23 price target is also justified by a DCF analysis. In our 10-year DCF analysis, we have assumed a revenue CAGR 
(2011-2020)  of  14%  and  an  EBITDA  CAGR  of  30%.  Additionally,  we  estimate  a  FCF  CAGR  (2012-2020)  of  41%.    
Furthermore, we have assume a weighted average cost of capital of 11.7%, FCF growth in perpetuity  of 5%, and a 
terminal FCF multiple of 15x.

Relative to shares of a peer group of leading eCommerce companies, Active shares trade at a 2012E EV/EBITDA multiple 
of  20x versus 15x for the peer group. While Active shares trade at a premium, we believe the premium is justified given 
our higher long-term growth estimate for Active. We estimate Actives long-term earnings growth at approximately 35% 
versus the peer group at 22%, and, hence, Active shares trade at a 2012E EV/EBITDA/Growth multiple of 0.6x, in line 
with the peer group at 0.7x.

                                                                                                 Company Report          

                                                    
 
Business  Segments.  Active  Network  reports  revenues  under  Technology  revenues  as  well  as  Marketing  Services 
revenues. For 2010, Technology revenues represented 85% of the total while Marketing Services represented 15% of 
revenues.    
 
    •   Technology revenue.  Technology revenues consist of registration revenues (83% of Technology revenues in 
        2010) as well as software license, maintenance, and hosting revenues.   
            o   Registration  revenues.  Registration  fees  are  typically  based  on  a  percentage  of  the  total  dollars 
                processed for a registration and typically have both a fixed and variable component. Active Networks 
                typical contract length for registration customers is three years. In 2010, Active processed 70.2 million 
                transactions  for  47,300  organizations  totaling  $197.6  million  in  registration  revenues  or  $2.28  per 
                registration.  
            o   Licensed   software,   maintenance,   hosting,   and   implementation   revenues.  Licensed   software, 
                maintenance, hosting, and implementation fees accounted for 17% of technology revenues in 2010. We 
                expect these revenues to decline as a percentage of revenues over time as the company transitions 
                customers to transaction-based solutions.     
     
    •   Marketing Services revenues. Marketing Services accounted for 15% of 2010 total revenues. The Marketing 
        Services segment provides customers with 1) online services (e.g., email, targeted newsletter promotions); 2) field 
        marketing (e.g., event promotions and sponsorships); 3) commerce revenue (e.g., membership programs, training 
        programs, and websites). The contract length for Marketing Services customers is typically less than one year.

Market Opportunity 
 
North American Technology Market Opportunity.  Active Network estimates that there are 800,000 potential customers 
in North America across its four key customer groups: sports, community, outdoors, and business events. Based on this, 
Active has approximately 5-6% market share of potential customers. Furthermore, Active Network estimates that its target 
market includes over 1.8 billion annual registrations in the United States (Active estimates it processes approximately 5% 
of registrations today), representing $110 billion in registration spending. Assuming a 9% take rate, which we believe is 
reasonable, this would equate to a potential North American market of roughly $10 billion in revenues.    
 
Triathlon Market Shows Potential of Platform.  Active Networks most developed segment is the triathlon market, which 
the company estimates that it works with 60% of the triathlon organizations and over 60% of those participants transacting 
online, suggesting Active registers 36% of triathlon participants in North America. In contrast, Active estimates that it 
processes  just  2%  of  total  registrations,  suggesting  a  significant  opportunity  if  Active  can  continue  to  increase  its 
penetration rates in the less mature markets.   
 
Marketing Services Opportunity.  Active estimates that its North American Marketing Services opportunity is $10 billion, 
equivalent to the size of its technology revenues. We note that in Actives most mature endurance vertical, nearly half of 
its revenues come from marketing services fees.    
 
International  Opportunity.  While  still  small  today  (less  than  5%  of  2010  revenues),  Active  believes  the  longer-term 
opportunity for International (primarily Europe and APAC) should be as large as the North American market.    
 
Growth Drivers 
 
We believe Active Networks should benefit from numerous growth drivers, which we believe should enable Active to 
achieve mid-teens long-term revenue growth.     
 
    •   Increase   number   of   organizations .   In   2010,   Active   worked   with   approximately   47,000  organizations, 
        representing  approximately  5%  of  its  potential  customer  base.  We  believe  that  through  increased  sales  and 
        marketing, and continued adoption of Web-based solutions, the company should be able to significantly increase 
        its organization count over the long term.  
 
    •   Increase Online Penetration.  Of the organizations that Active works with, approximately 20% transact online 
        today. We expect this percentage to increase significantly longer term through increased training of its customer 
        base, increased awareness of Actives websites, and emerging forms of marketing including social and mobile.  
        We note that in the companys triathlon segment, approximately 60% of registrations are online today. We note 
        that higher online penetration should also increase Actives revenue per customer.  
 
    •   International.  International  represented  less  than  5%  of  revenues  in  2010,  though  we  believe  Active  has  a 
        significant opportunity to expand internationally, primarily Europe and APAC. We believe Active will focus on the 
        endurance and corporate events categories initially.  
 
    •   Additional  Vertical  Markets.  We  believe  there  is  an  opportunity  to  expand  into  other  markets  whereby  its 
        technology platform can deliver similar benefits to a specific market vertical.  For example, Active recently entered 
        the faith-based category through the acquisition of Fellowship Technologies, whereby it added 1,700 churches as 
        clients.    
 
    •   Sell Additional Modules to Installed Base.  We expect Active to focus on cross-selling additional modules into 
        its  installed  base,  encompassing  both  technology  and  marketing  solutions.  We  note  that  marketing  services 
        represent nearly 50% of endurance category revenues but only 15% of total revenues, and, hence, we believe 
        there is an opportunity to further cross-sell these solutions into its other verticals. Additionally, we expect Active to 
        cross-sell technology solutions such as call-center services and survey services.    

                                                                                                                            
 

                                                                                                                Page 11

                                                                                                  Company Report           

                                                    
 
    •   Acquisitions.  We  expect  Active  to  remain  acquisitive  in  order  to  gain  further  market  share  in  its  current 
        categories, expand into additional categories, and expand internationally.   
 
    •   Daily  Deals.  We  expect  Active  to  aggressively  expand  its  group  buying  platform  Schwaggle  to  additional 
        geographies.  Schwaggle offers deals on fitness-related products and services. Schwaggle  is currently  in four 
        cities (San Francisco, New York, Los Angles, and Chicago) though the company plans to roll out to a total of 25 
        cities by the end of 2011 and to select international markets in 2012. Schwaggle offers a variety of discounts from 
        endurance sports, to spas, to magazine subscriptions, to golf lessons.

Management Overview 
 
Dave Alberga,  CEO.  Mr. Alberga oversees the executive management team for all of Active Networks markets and leads 
the  general  managers  in  new  business  development.  Prior  to  Active  Network,  Mr.  Alberga  headed  operations  for 
Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., a leading portal and transaction company. Additional experience includes senior 
management  positions  with  Linear  Technology  Corporation,  Silicon  Valley  Technology  and  consulting  and  brand 
management at the Boston Consulting Group and Procter & Gamble Company. Mr. Alberga holds a Master of Business 
Administration degree and a masters degree in arts from Stanford University. He earned a bachelors degree in general 
engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point.  
.  
Matt Landa , President.  Mr. Landa heads all operations including strategy, sales, professional services, technology, and 
financial execution. Prior to Active Network, Mr. Landa was president and chief executive officer of Silicon Valley-based 
CMC Industries. Prior to CMC Industries, Mr. Landa was chief operating officer of Silicon Valley Technology (SVT), a 
high-volume  manufacturer  of  electronics  products.  Additional  experience  includes  serving  as  an  associate  of  Monitor 
Company, a strategic consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Landa holds a Master of Business Administration 
degree  from  Stanford  University  and  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  from  Dartmouth  College  with  concentrations  in 
engineering and economics. 
 
Scott Mendel  , Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Mendel is responsible for Active Networks corporate finance, accounting, 
and  investor  relations  functions.  Prior  to  joining  Active  Network,  Mr.  Mendel  worked  in  finance  positions  for  General 
Electric (GE) for over 20 years. In his most recent position, chief financial officer for GEs Healthcare IT division, he led a 
150-person global finance function and headed up the financial due diligence and integration of a $1.2 billion acquisition in 
2006.  Mendel  received  his  undergraduate  degree  in  finance  from  Indiana  University  and  his  Master  of  Business 
Administration degree from Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management. 
 
John Belmonte,  Chief Media Officer .  Mr. Belmonte has served as chief media officer since February, 2011. He also 
served as chief operating officer from April 2000 to February 2011. Previous to Active Network, he was co-founder and 
president of LeagueLink, a Web-based service for administering recreational sports leagues. Active acquired LeagueLink 
in April 2000. Mr. Belmonte also worked as a strategy consultant for Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Belmonte has a B.S.E. 
from University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Business and a Master of Business Administration degree from 
Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management.  
 
Risks to Price Target 
 
Acquisitions.  Active has been highly acquisitive, with over 25 acquisitions over the past five years. Going forward, we 
believe the company will likely continue to be acquisitive to gain share and expand into new categories and geographies. 
While  we  believe  the  companys  track  in  integrating  acquisitions  has  been  good  thus  far,  acquisitions  always  create 
uncertainties and could be a distraction for management.  
 
Competition.  While we believe the market for Web-based reservations and activity-based software is highly fragmented, 
we  believe  the  large  and  growing  market  opportunity  is  likely  to  attract  additional  entrants.  Today,  Active  primarily 
competes with legacy registration methods such and pen and paper, mail, and phone-based reservations. Additionally, 
Active competes with internally developed software applications, off-the-shelf software (e.g., Microsoft Excel), as well as 
companies that offer Web-based solutions in one or more of its vertical areas.  
 
Slower Adoption of Web-Based Reservation Systems.  While online penetration for events and activities registration is 
still low today, which presents significant growth potential for the company, slower-than-expected online adoption from 
organizations and participants may limit Active Networks near-term growth potential.  
 
Macroeconomic Environment.   We believe the activities and events market is sensitive to consumer sentiment and the 
overall  economic  environment.  For  instance,  the  company  experienced  a  significant  slowdown  in  its  business  in  the 
second  half  of  2008  due  to  the  economic  downturn.  In  addition,  due  to  the  companys  exposure  to  the  parks  and 
recreation segment, governmental budgetary cuts could adversely impact the companys growth rates.

                                                                                                 Company Report           

                                                    
 
 
Transition to ActiveWorks Platform.  While we believe the companys transition from its legacy platform to PaaS-based 
ActiveWorks should drive increased efficiencies and margin expansion, the transition is time consuming and requires 
significant investment. We note that in 2010, approximately 35% of Actives research and development spending was on 
the legacy platform. We currently expect Active to transition off the legacy platform by 2014. Delays in the transition (i.e., 
difficulties in convincing customers to migrate) would likely adversely impact Actives operating leverage.    
 
Expand into New Businesses.  While we believe the ActiveWorks platform should enable the company to expand into 
new verticals, new verticals may require significant incremental investment. Additionally, new businesses may require 
additional expertise that Active may not have, and as such Active would need to invest in additional personal.  
 
International Expansion.  We expect Active to look to expand more internationally in the future, given the potentially large 
international market for Actives solutions.  That said, differences in a specific countrys culture and lack of international 
operational experience of Active could limit the companys success internationally. We believe it is likely that Active will 
look to a partner and acquisition strategy for international, which could create additional risks and uncertainties.    
 
Environmental Impact.  Actives business, especially the Outdoors vertical, could be negatively affected by environmental 
conditions.  For instance, during the Gulf oil spill in the summer of 2010, Actives outdoor growth was negatively impacted.

      Summary and Investment Conclusion 

      Active Network (ACTV) is a company that shows many of the attributes of successful Internet companies that we like to see, 
      including: 1) a unique business model that is difficult to replicate or compete against; 2) a unique relationship with its customers (both 
      organizations and participants); and 3) strong recurring revenue and visibility. 

      ACTV’s business model is simple: the company automates the labor-intensive process of registering participants for different kinds of 
      events. Organizations from triathlons to soccer camps to campgrounds to church groups all use Active Network’s software and 
      websites to register participants online for their respective events. ACTV’s solutions are mission-critical for many of these 
      organizations, which historically (and in many cases currently) had to manage the registration process manually offline. Active 
      Network not only processes the registration transaction, but also provides lots of analytics, tracking, optimization and demand 
      generation tools to its customers in an effort to increase the event organizer’s revenue and decrease costs. For these services and 
      solutions, ACTV charges its customers around 6.5% of each registration fee, which aligns the customer’s incentive of increasing the 
      size (and revenue generation) of the event, with Active Network’s goal of increasing its revenue. 

      Looking across the landscape of online advertising, online travel and e-commerce sectors that we cover, we find few companies that 
      enjoy Active Network’s dominant position in its space and below-average level of large-scale competition. The company’s 2010-
      2012E 15% revenue CAGR may fall short of some of the faster-growing, newer business models emerging in the space, but few 
      others have the same entrenched position in their respective industry. As a result, shareholders are likely to realize value over time as 
      the company continues on its stable growth trajectory but begins to pull some of the cost/efficiency levers. Our expectation for a 
      highly predictable, 15% revenue CAGR with expanding margins is likely to warrant a premium valuation over time.

   Investment Thesis 
   Our bullish thesis on Active Network is based on the following six factors: 1) the company has the highest level of revenue visibility 
   in our coverage universe; 2) we expect EBITDA margins to expand significantly through 2015; 3) ACTV operates in a large 
   addressable market with low online penetration; 4) revenue and margins will naturally benefit from a shift to online; 5) there is 
   minimal competition that poses any real threat to Active Network’s position; and 6) ACTV’s proven management team has 
   demonstrated its ability to execute and grow the business both organically and through accretive M&A. 

   Active Network Has the Highest Level of Revenue Visibility in Our Coverage Universe 
   The recurring nature of the events that Active Network supports and the long-term nature of its customer contracts (and low churn) 
   provide the company with an unusually high level of revenue visibility. Active Network can predict approximately 85% of the 
   following year’s revenue before the start of the year. The organizations that Active Network provides its services to operate events on 
   a regular schedule each year or several times per year, and ACTV can reasonably expect to run the same event the following year. 
   Active’s goal is to reduce costs and increase revenue for its clients, while increasing the mix of event participants signing up through 
   Active Network (vs. offline) and hence online.

 30%to 2012, well ahead of the peer average of 29% (defined as our coverage universe), despite revenue growth at only a 15% CAGR. We 
   project adjusted EBITDA to grow to $33.1 million in 2011 and $51.0 million in 2012, up from $25.1 million in 2010.

       Exhibit 4 illustrates where Active Network expects to gain leverage in each expense line in its income statement in order to reach its 
       target adjusted EBITDA margin of ~25%. (Note that the individual expense lines include depreciation and amortization which are 
       added back to arrive at adjusted EBITDA, and thus adding these lines together does not arrive at the total EBITDA margin shown.) 
       We discuss each of these expense areas below.

     Sales & Marketing 
     The company expects Sales & Marketing (S&M) expense as a percentage of revenue to achieve the least amount of leverage in the 
     coming years, with only around 200bps through 2013-2015 (21% to 19% of revenue). ACTV will continue to invest in S&M activities 
     to increase its breadth of organizations and events under management. S&M expense is largely comprised of salary and benefits for 
     sales and marketing employees, but also includes other promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing. 
     As the sales staff matures and becomes more productive, we estimate the company should see modest operating leverage.

     Active Network expects to achieve leverage of ~500bp-600bp from Research & Development (R&D) from 2010 to 2013-2015, going 
     from 22% of revenue in 2010 to ~16.5% in three to five years. R&D costs support the technology platforms used and thus reflect both 
     in-house platforms that will be used going forward (the “Base” platforms), as well as those added in corporate acquisitions and older

     systems being retired (the “End of Life”, or “EOL”, platforms). The company is building a unified single platform for all of its various 
     customers and verticals to operate on top of. This project is one of the largest initiatives at ACTV2010Target over the next several years and

     should bring about efficiencies and greater speed and flexibility to roll out new features and services to its clients. In the interim, the 
     older and acquired systems must be maintained and kept reasonably up to date until customers operating through those platforms can 
     be ported over to the new Active Network software stack, a process that is likely to take several years.

     Leverage from R&D will come from both economies of scale on the Base platform as well as the tapering off of expenses related to 
     the maintenance of EOL systems.  

     General & Administrative 
     The company expects to gain between 300bp and 400bp of leverage over the next four to five years in General & Administrative 
     (G&A) expense as a percent of revenue, going from a reported 13.6% of revenue in 2010 to a target of ~10%. G&A expense is largely 
     comprised of salary and benefits for employees in support roles, such as finance, legal, and public company costs, but also includes 
    $100professional fees as well as software and travel expenses for support employees. Similar to most companies in our coverage universe, 30%
     beyond the increased public company costs in 2011, ACTV should see operating leverage naturally in G&A as revenue growth

      Large TAM with Below-Average Online Penetration 

      $10 Billion Total Marketplace for Event Registrations  
      The event registrations marketplace is primarily one that has the vast majority (97%) processed offline. According to Active Network, 
      in 2010, over 800,000 organizations hosted recreational or communal events that required over 1.7 billion event participants in North 
      America to complete a registration form, with total participation or “activity” fees collected around these events summing to 
      approximately $109 billion. The typical registration processing fee (or “take rate”) is around ~6.5% of total activity fees, often with 
      additional fees for registration and application. In total, this translated to the total addressable market (TAM) opportunity in the North 
      American event registration space to more than $10 billion in 2010.

      Only 3% of Total Registrations Processed Online 
      According to Active Network, in 2010, only ~3% of the 1.7 billion event registrations completed were processed online, or 
      approximately 51 million registrations. By comparison, Active Network completed around 40% of its registrations online in 2010, 
      with 28.3 million online registrations, or on the order of 55% of the total market’s online registrations (assuming 51 million total 
      online registrations). As more registrations move online at ACTV’s organization customers, the company could see modest 
      acceleration in growth, as it tends to pick up a disproportionate share given its wide reach in the space.

In 2010 Active Network processed ~70 million registrations in total, which represented ~4% of total event registrations. The 70 
million total registrations handled by Active Network represents ~4% of registrations in North America, and the 28 million online 
registrations represent only 2% of the total North American market. Active Network managed registrations for 47,000 organizations, 
representing ~6% of the 800,000 North American organizations that hosted an event (although we don’t like to focus on total number 
of organizations because size of organization can significantly skew the data).  

Core Registration Segments 
Active’s addressable market consists of four broad organization categories (today): business, community, sports, and outdoors. Of the 
over 800,000 organizations that hosted an event in 2010, the vast majority, ~500,000, were community organizations, followed by 
sports (225,000+), business (100,000+) and outdoors (12,000+). We note that a particular organization may have any number of 
events and even more volume of registrations per year, so the use of organizations as a growth or market penetration metric can be 
somewhat misleading (and hence, we present these statistics here only to give a sense of the marketplace and clientele for Active 
Network). Individual registration volume estimates are also not available on a category level so it is difficult to identify an accurate 
market share for ACTV across the four major segments.  

Sports: Organizations in the sports segment include endurance events (Active Network’s first core services area), sport organizers, 
leagues, tournaments, sports camps, and golf courses. In 2010, there was a TAM of over 225,000 sport organizations, leagues and 
tournaments as well as 16,000 golf courses that relied on event registrations. Active Network currently manages registrations for over 
1,500 public golf courses (e.g., BethPage Golf Club, Hilton Golf), 10,000+ endurance event customers (e.g., the Ironman Triathlon), 
and 25,500+ leagues and clubs (e.g., United States Tennis Association), so the sports segment still only addresses a fraction of the 
total addressable market, even though Active Network has provided services to this vertical longer than any of the others. 

Outdoors: Outdoor organizations include campground sites and state hunting & fishing departments. In North America alone, the 
TAM for these organizations is over 12,000 campground sites as well as hunting & fishing departments for all 50 states. By the end of 
2010, 34 states were managing their campgrounds (4,000+ parks and 3,000+ campgrounds) and 23 states were managing their hunting 
and fishing licenses via Active software, websites and call centers. Reserve America, ACTV’s campground reservation service, 
acquired from IAC in 2009 for $50 million, falls into the Outdoors vertical. 

Community: This customer segment includes educational, non-recreational government and faith-based organizations as well as 
camps and park and recreation agencies. In 2010, Active Network had over 1,500+ parks departments and community recreational 
centers, 3,500+ educational organizations, 1,600+ summer camps and over 100+ city and country governments. That year, the TAM in 
North America consisted of over 90,000 educational and 55,000 non-recreational government organizations, 270,000 religious groups, 
50,000 camps and 9,000 parks and recreation agencies. 

Business: The business segment includes all corporations that are using third-party registration services to manage conferences, 
speaker series, fundraisers and other corporate events. In 2010 over 100,000 corporate and business organizations hosted events that 
required some form of event registration. ACTV has over 8,000 corporate clients including Subway, Cisco, Microsoft and Hewlett-
Packard, among others. 

The Endurance Vertical – A Proxy for What the Rest of the Segments Could Evolve To 
Active Network holds a significantly higher percentage of the total available organizations and registrations in the endurance sports 
(i.e., triathlon and marathon) category. At its inception, Active Network wanted to solve the problem of participants signing up for 
important endurance sports events, which previously were handled mostly offline, by mail/check, which were very problematic for 
both organizations and participants. Event organizers realized significant revenue generation, cost savings, and troubleshooting 
benefits once they adopted Active Network’s online registration platform. As more and more endurance events shifted their event 
registration and event promotions to Active Network, the company’s market share in the category increased. 

ACTV has been in the endurance space for 13 years and has managed to win over 70% market share of organizations in the category. 
More importantly, as event organizers use Active Network, they are seeing higher revenue generation and lower costs of registration 
over time, the real value proposition of working with Active. The company’s role in the endurance category has allowed 45% of 
overall registrations to now take place via ACTV, well above the company’s overall industry penetration of 4% (discussed below). 
ACTV’s goal is to replicate the success it has experienced in the endurance category across each of its other verticals: winning more 
and more events and organizations, and shifting more registrations from offline to the more efficient online process, which is the key 
driver of the long-term growth thesis.

      In 2010, there were over 1.7 billion event registrations, of which 70 million, or 4%, were completed through Active Network. 
      However, of the 1.1 million endurance sports registrations in the U.S. in 2010, ~500,000, or 45%, registered for their event through 
      Active Network. 

      Mix Shift to Online Drives Revenue and Margin 
      Active’s registration business model is simple: the company earns an average of 6.5% plus additional fees for each registration that it 
      processes (the take rate discussed below). The revenue growth at the company is driven by growing the volume of registrations 
      managed by ACTV and increasing the revenue per registration. Volume growth is dictated by share shift from offline to online and 
      increased market share for ACTV. Revenue per registration is mostly a function of mix of registrations. 

      There are two scenarios under which mix shift will drive additional registration revenue: 1) a higher take rate on hunting and fishing 
      licenses purchased directly from Active NetworkNorth America Market versus via other means (offline and off ACTV)Triathlons; and 2) additional registrations 
      captured by ACTV at events where some 1.7B Participantsoffline cash transactions are currently not done through the Active Network system. Beyond 1.1M Participants 
      the revenue boost, a shift to online registrations will also cut down on costs from the more labor-intensive call centers, increasing 
      margins. In 2010, Active Network processed 28.3 million registrations online, an increase of 20.8% vs. 2009. We estimate that the 
      number of online registrations will increase 16% in 2011 and 14% in 2012, bringing the number of online registrations processed by 
      ACTV in 2012 to 37.5 million. As online registration growth continues to outpace offline registration growth, we estimate that online 
      registrations as a percentage of total registrations will increase from 35.8% in 2009 to 44.9% in 2012, or roughly 230bp of share shift 
      per annum.                                               ACTV                             Other TAM

      Licenses Booked Online Earn Higher Take Rate 
      Hunting and fishing licenses booked offline tend to earn a lower take rate for Active Network due to the revenue share paid out to the 
      offline merchant. Offline registrations for licenses are typically done through retailers at a physical location, like a bait & tackle shop 
      or a Walmart. The registrant will request the license at the cashier who enters the information into a point of sale (POS) machine and 
      provides the license. As the retailer is performing a service, Active Network shares the revenue earned from the registration. Under the 
      current economics, a hunting or fishing license booked at a physical retailer earns Active Network net revenue of around ~$0.90, 
      while a license booked online earns the company ~$3, more than three times as much. A shift to online offers a clear benefit in a 
      higher take rate for Active Network.

      retailer’s primary objective. 

      Additional Volume as Out-of-System Registrations Move Online 
      Events often offer day-of registrations that are performed in cash and are not captured in the ACTV system. While Active Network 
      may have been contracted to handle all of the registrations for the event, both on- and offline, the company has no control over these 
      transactions, and will not be paid for the registration. In this scenario, a greater mix of online registrations simply results in a greater 
      volume of registrations being completed through the Active Network system, driving higher revenue growth despite the take rate 
      being equivalent between on- and offline. 

      Online Registrations Cost Less per Unit than Offline Registrations for Active 
      As more registrations move online, ACTV will be able to realize higher margins, as noted in the “EBITDA Margins to Expand 
      Significantly” section above. Once the initial investment has been made on the registration technology platform, online registrations 
      have a natural lower-cost higher-efficiency over similar offline registrations, which have a higher variable labor component. Online 
      registrations are often fully automated, so an incremental transaction does not have any associated cost (outside of minimal cost 
      allocation for web hosting and maintenance) and is much less prone to human error. On the other hand, offline registrations are 
      performed through one of Active Network’s call centers, which have a direct labor component associated in the call technician taking 
      and processing the registration. In the case of some outdoor activity registrations, such as campground management, the ASP is so low 
      that the variable cost to Active Network balances out any gain in revenue, resulting in effectively a breakeven registration.  

      Minimal Competition Online 
      The market for online event registrations is very fragmented. As discussed below, there are a number of organizations across a wide 
      range of categories that require software solutions to handle their registrations. Active Network is the leading provider of these 
      registration solutions by a significant margin in this fragmented space, at over six times the registration revenue and volume of its 
      closest competitor.  

      ACTV has acquired a number of large and small competitors over the years in an attempt to diversify the categories that it operates in, 
      and the organizations that it depends on. Across all of these verticals, there are common requirements from event customers: they need 
      a solution that reduces cost, allows for tracking and management of their events, allows for marketing and promotion, and has certain 
      compliance requirements. As a result, few service providers have the scale necessary to compete with Active Network on price and 
      service quality. 

      The majority of online event registration competition comes from small niche competitors, which have legacy relationships with a few 
      organizations in their immediate region. A few examples include Eventrite, an event-based management and e-commerce company 
      that targets small communities events; Meetup Inc., a social network that assists group meeting organization; MyPunchBowl, a party 
      planning and management service; and Amiando, a global SaaS provider that assists with event marketing, registration and payment

threat, we briefly describe Cvent below.

reports, to date, Cvent is used by over 90,000 professionals, and since its inception, it has managed over 275,000 events and surveys. 
Cvent offers customers a variety of online services including event management, supplier networking, meeting management and web 
surveying. Cvent solutions compete primarily with Active Network’s corporate segment, but Cvent competes in the non-profit, 
government and educational space as well.  

Cvent’s primary solutions are: 

Event Management: A proprietary event management software that enables customers to manage registration, marketing, budgeting, 
analytics and other aspects of events online. 

Supplier Network Services (SNS): SNS is an online database that matches event space suppliers with organizations that are looking 
for large venues to host upcoming events. 

Meeting Management: Meeting Management solutions help organizations plan, manage and source their meetings while also 
providing analytical tools to help corporations identify and evaluate a meeting’s effectiveness and ROI.  

High Quality Management Team 
One of Active Network’s biggest intangible assets is its culture. The company has many endurance sports athletes across many parts 
of the organization. This athletic culture has created a very driven and aggressive “get things done” attitude that most ACTV 
employees embrace. 

Active Network has assembled a top management team, many of which have been with the company for over ten years, which 
embodies several qualities we see as key to the company’s success. In addition to solid organic growth, a significant portion of 
ACTV’s growth has come through acquisitions of competing and complementary companies, a strong internal culture is extremely 
important to ensure a successful integration; we believe that culture is driven from the top by the strong management team.  

Risks to Monitor 
As mentioned above, Active Network’s model is unique in that it does not have as much risk from competition as other online 
businesses we cover across e-commerce, online advertising and online travel. Active Network typically competes against smaller 
regional companies that have relationships with organizations, but can rarely compete on resource allocation, breadth of services 
provided, or in some cases, price. There are also some “free-mium” registration solutions that are available to organizations today and 
should increasingly become available as software applications shift from a client-server architecture, to a more collaborative cloud 
architecture over the next several years. We don’t expect ACTV to lose share to these companies, but in some cases, smaller 
organizations could choose to in-house their registration process. 

Outside of the risk from competition, we see three primary risks to our investment thesis: 1) our adjusted EBITDA growth estimates of 
32% and 54% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, are contingent upon ACTV achieving operational leverage; therefore, there is a risk that 
any delay or failure to deliver on margin expansion plans could cause EBITDA to fall short of future estimates; 2) a loss of a large 
customer(s) could lead to a considerable reduction in registrations; and 3) integration risks associated with future M&A. 

Margin Expansion from Platform Upgrade Might Not Deliver on Time or Meet Expectations 
Our 2011 and 2012 adjusted EBITDA estimates imply year-on-year growth rates of 32% and 54%, respectively, compared to year-on-
year revenue growth of 15% in both years. As EBITDA growth outpaces revenue growth, we project ACTV’s adjusted EBITDA 
margin will expand from 9.0% in 2010 to 13.8% in 2012. Although management expects long-term revenue growth to remain ~15%, 
ACTV believes that its adjusted EBITDA margin could expand to ~25% by 2015. Every 10bp reduction in our implied adjusted 
EBITDA margin for 2011 and 2012 would reduce our 2011 and 2012 EBITDA estimates by approximately 1%. 

As noted earlier, to achieve the 25% EBITDA margin target, Active Network believes it can gain: 1) 500-600bp of leverage from cost 
of revenue from technological fixed cost efficiencies; 2) S&M leverage of ~200bp from revenue growth outpacing headcount 
increases; 3) 500-600bp of leverage from R&D as support costs for acquired platforms are reduced over time; and 4) 300-400bp of 
leverage from G&A from efficiencies in infrastructure and from revenue growth outpacing headcount increases.  

Cost of revenue leverage should come largely from efficiencies in fixed costs (call center expenses) as registration mix shifts to 
online; however, it could happen that users fail to use online for registration or the shift to online happens much slower than expected, 
which would result in a delay or elimination of cost of revenue leverage. Like most other online categories, we expect (and have 
witnessed to date) a natural shift in registration volume from offline to online. Mobile registrations should help shift from offline to 
online.

July 5, 2011                                                                                              Active Network, Inc.

S&M and G&A leverage both come from an anticipated growth in revenue above headcount growth, as employees in the two groups 
are able to achieve scale efficiencies and become more productive. The sales staff becomes more efficient as it matures, and the 
members of G&A are able to make better use of time and serve more employees as a growing department allows for greater 
specialization of roles. In S&M, the risk that target margins are not achieved is mitigated by the fact that if the company needs to slow 
hiring in that department, employee mix will shift to more experienced, more productive members, supporting margins. The additional 
leverage in G&A from infrastructure and scale efficiencies will come eventually, even if revenue growth is slower than anticipated; 
the infrastructure investment has already been made, so the company will benefit from scale, even if it is delayed.  

The greatest risk to achieving target leverage in R&D is delays in the single-platform initiative, which allows for end-of-lifeing some 
of the legacy software platforms from acquired companies. Additional M&A activity could also introduce more EOL technology 
expense which would compress margins. 

Loss of Large Contracts  
The majority of ACTV’s revenues are generated from customers that have entered into long-term contracts, with the standard contract 
length ranging from three to seven years. However, Active Network has multiple customers that operate under contracts that have 
terms of service less than three years, some of which actually renew on a yearly basis. If these customers decide not to renew with 
ACTV, which may not necessarily be a reflection on the Active service offering but rather due to the client’s financial situation 
(especially in the case of state and municipal government contracts), ACTV could report financial results below expectations. 

As of early 2011, Active Network operated registration services for fishing and hunting licenses in 23 states and provided reservation 
and management services for campgrounds in 32 states. In addition, ACTV works with many community organizations that fall under 
the jurisdiction of local and state agencies. These contracts are subject to an open bidding process and must be renewed every two 
years. A failure to re-win these contracts would negatively affect financial performance.  

While the potential loss of customer contracts will always remain a risk for ACTV, we believe that the loss of multiple large 
organization contracts is unlikely. The typical ROI for an Active Network customer is 381%, so there is significant incentive for 
clients to remain with the company. ACTV’s solutions help organizations increase their participants per event while simultaneously 
reducing costs, giving organizations increased dependency on ACTV and little reason to consider not renewing. An internal analysis 
conducted by ACTV in 2010, in which it analyzed 75% of its registration revenue, found that its registration churn in terms of revenue 
dollars was less than 5%. 

Complications from M&A Integration  
Active Network is a roll-up of several services providers across the four vertical categories mentioned previously. M&A has been 
ACTV’s primary method for entering new markets and sub-verticals. The company has completed 27 acquisitions since its inception. 
Increased M&A activity poses two potential risks for ACTV: 1) acquisitions could delay the margin expansion target time-line, which 
could cause reported EBITDA figures to be below market estimates; and 2) with any M&A, integration risk is always a concern.

   Company Overview 
   Active Network provides event registration software and services to community, sports, business and outdoor organizations. In 
   addition to registration processing, Active Network’s technology platform provides organizations with various marketing, operating 
   and analytics tools which help their clients’ event management end-to-end by increasing event participation and reducing overall event 
   costs. 

   The Business Model  
   The company operates under two primary revenue lines: technology and marketing. Technology revenue consists of two areas:  
   1) Registration revenue: earned through the completion of registrations where ACTV earns a ~6.5% take rate on each registration fee; 
   and 2) Software License revenue: via Active licensing software to certain organizations on a flat monthly fee. Marketing revenue 
   includes several items, such as online advertising, marketing done at client events, and commerce revenue from ancillary items sold 
   through Active Network’s site.

   The majority of company revenues consist of Registration revenue, which represented 71% of total company revenue in 2010; 
   Software revenue represented 14% of total revenue; and Marketing made up the remaining 15%. We project Registration revenue to 
   grow at 14% and 15% over each of the next two years, respectively, maintaining its approximate share of total revenue at 70% of total 
400in 2012E. Software revenue is projected to outpace the other two lines in 2011, at 30% y/y growth, before decelerating to 15% in 
   2012E; marketing is projected to grow at only 4% in 2011, against a tougher comp, before reaccelerating to 17% in 2012E.

       In 2010, Registration revenues of $197.6 million were approximately 83% of technology revenues and 70% of total revenues, in line 
       with 2009 levels. We project Registration revenues to grow 14.4% in 2011 and 14.7% in 2012, to $259 million. Registration revenues 
       will be driven by both the number of registrations completed through Active Network’s technology, as well as from an increase in 
       average revenue per registration. Registration volume growth is driven by: 1) Active winning more customers; 2) existing customers 
       shift more of their events to Active; and 3) Active processing more registrations from existing clients for the same events (typically as 
       event registrations shift from offline/in person to online via Active’s software).

     In 2010, ACTV’s revenue per registration was $2.82, a 5.9% increase from 2009, as shown in Exhibit 18; we expect revenue per 
     registration to continue to grow in 2011 and 2012. We estimate that revenue per registration will increase 6.4% and 3.6% in 2011 and 
     2012, respectively, implying revenue per registration of $3.10 in 2012. It should be noted that Active Network has not increased its prices 
     in three years, and our projections do not incorporate any price increase on the average ~6.5% take rate (excluding additional fees) 
     through 2012.

     performing a service, ACTV must pay a revenue share, which drives take rate down from the ~$3 per registration earned online to 
     around $0.90 per license. Active Network currently processes more than 30 million hunting and fishing licenses per year, with only 
     9% of those booked online. As more of these users begin to register online, the significantly higher take rate will drive a higher 
     revenue per registration.

     While we expect the average revenue per registration will grow in the low-to-mid single digits over the next few years, Exhibit 19 
     highlights the seasonality of registration revenues. In 1Q11 ACTV reported revenue per registration of $3.69, well ahead of our full-
     year 2011 estimate of $3.00, and we estimate that revenue per registration will decline to $3.05, $2.72, and $2.70 in 2Q11, 3Q11, and 
     4Q11, respectively.  

     The sequential declines in revenue per registration are the result of mix shift, as fishing and hunting licenses and campground 
     registration revenues are closer to ~$1 per license/registration, and these activities make up the smallest percentage of total 
$4.00
     registrations in 1Q. Hunting and fishing$3.69 and campground registrations as a percentage of total registrations increase throughout the 

$3.50year during the peak outdoor seasons. However, the seasonal affect of revenue per registration will become less extreme over time as 
     growth in other segments should outpace growth in these lower revenue per registrati$3.05on verticals.

     The second component of technology revenue comes from the licensing of ACTV software to organizations. In 2010, software

  In 2010, Software revenues were $40.1 million, up 10% from 2009; we expect further growth in revenue of 30% in 2011 and 16% in 
  2012 to reach revenue of $60 million. We expect software revenue as a percentage of total revenue to remain at ~15% over the next 
  few years, in line with historical averages.  

  Marketing Revenue 
  Active Network generates approximately 15% of its revenues from marketing-related services, which consist of revenues earned 
  through three primary sub-segments: online marketing, field marketing, and commerce. Online marketing services include 
  banner/display ads that appear on Active.com sites, button ads and newsletter and email marketing. Field marketing services include a 
  wide range of event promotions and sponsorship which can take place at the customer’s event or elsewhere. Commerce revenues 

$70include membership programs, training programs, websites, and other purchases made 35%through Active.com websites.  
                                                                       $60.4

  Exhibit 22 below displays the revenue contribution for the three marketing segments in 2010, although they are not typically broken 
  out specifically by the company on an ongoing basis. Online Services accounted for approximately 45% of total marketing revenues, 
  or $19 million. Commerce revenues and Field Marketing revenues of $17.2 million and $5.7 million represented 41% and 14% of 
  marketing revenues, respectively. The company does not expect the percentage that each segment represents of total marketing 
  revenues to fluctuate meaningfully over the next few years.

   How ACTV Acquires Customers  
   Active Network increases its revenue via three primary forms of customer acquisition: 1) winning new customers; 2) winning events 
   at existing customers (that were previously not managed by ACTV); and 3) gaining share of registrations within existing events from 
   offline (not via Active Network) to online (via Active Network’s software).  

   Active Network’s core value proposition to clients includes: 1) driving demand (and hence revenue to the event) – ACTV is able to 
   bring new participants to its various clients’ events through marketing activities across the Active participant network (people who 
   have previously registered with ACTV); and 2) reducing cost of managing registrations via automation and services mentioned above.  

   How ACTV Acquires Customers – Organizations 
   The Active Network sales force is broken down into four primary roles: 1) enterprise account executives; 2) inside account executives; 
   3) self-service reps; and 4) account managers. Individuals are organized by customer group (e.g., sports, outdoors, etc.) and deployed 
   by geography. Collectively, the sales force is responsible for driving organization growth (i.e., new client wins and new event wins 
   within existing clients), whereas participation growth is driven by various marketing channels, as discussed below. 

                                                                                                                                     23

      Enterprise Account Executives 
      Enterprise Account Executives focus on leveraging state, government and corporate relations to drive new account opportunities. Each 
      executive is responsible for managing a specific territory by developing relationships with senior members of organizations and 
      leveraging those relationships into long-term business partnerships. At the beginning of 2011, Active Network had 42 executives in 
      North America and eight executives in various international regions. 

      Inside Account Executive 
      Inside Account Executives are contracted to drive new business by reaching out to prospective clients via email and phone. Each 
      executive focuses on developing unique business opportunities for clients through various Active Network offerings. These executives 
      are primarily commission-based employees that focus on middle tier clients. Active Network currently has 53 inside account 
      executives stationed in North America and six international posts.  

      Account Management 
      Account Management employees focus on managing customer accounts that have been brought in by enterprise and inside account 
      executives. Account managers are responsible for retaining clients, as well as up-selling clients to additional Active services to make 
      sure that they are utilizing the Active Network products that are relevant to their events and business operations. Active Network 
      currently has 62 account managers in North America and four in international regions.  

      Self-Service Representative 
      Self-Service Representatives are responsible for increasing Active Network’s market share amongst small and regional clients. Active 
      Network currently has 24 service reps in North America but none in international regions. 

      Time to Profitability 
      There is a learning curve for any new sales rep as ACTV’s solutions are more of a consultative sale versus other online services, and 
      most represent a longer-term investment by the company before they begin to produce. The average sales representative reaches a 
      breakeven point for Active Network after approximately 18 months. This includes a typical time to ramp up on client and industry 
      knowledge of 1-4 months, and a further 8-20 months to land enough clients to achieve profitability. The average ramp time for a sales 
      person is displayed in Exhibit 31.

    Offline B2B Strategies  
    Active Network will continue to rely on in-person marketing initiatives to complement its online presence. The offline strategy is 
    essential to attracting new customers, particularly large organizations that may not be aware of the growth, efficiencies or savings that 
    can be realized through the Active Network platform. In 2011, management expects to attend 120 trade shows, over 100 event 
    technology seminars, as well as launch Activation!, a 700-person corporate user conference.  

    How ACTV Acquires Customers – Registrations/Participants  
    Active Network’s ability to increase event participation is a major selling point for organizations. ACTV customers enjoy the cost 
    savings and operational efficiencies realized through the ACTV platform, but for many customers, it is the incremental participation 
    and the accompanying revenue increases that draw them to Active Network.  
                                     Other, 2%
             Tradeshows, 4%
    Active relies heavily on the organizations’ own sites as well as its owned and operated sites to increase the number of participants that 
    are registering for events. Approximately 60% of ACTV registrations PPC, 9%are directed from the site of the organization that is hosting the 
  Email Marketing, event, with the remaining 40% of customer registrations navigating directly to Active Network’s websites. This blended consumer 
    acquisition strategy positions ACTV to leverage the brand of the organization 6%hosting the event while also relying on its own loyal 
    participant/registrant base.  

    Social media and partner websites are two important consumer marketing channels for ACTV. Active Network’s Facebook fan page 
Webcasts, 14%has hundreds of thousands of active users that visit daily to learn about upcoming events and other real time information. Active 
    Network’s O&O sites are also fully integrated with Facebook, which enables users to share information with their friends. ACTV has 
    a significant Twitter presence, with many users relying on Twitter to help them raise money for charity as they enter races through 
    ACTV. Active Network also relies on partner sites to acquire participants, some of which can be seen below in Exhibit 33.

       Active Network partners with many sport organization sites including iHoops (above) and littleleague.org, among others. Users that 
       click on the Active Network logo are redirected to Active Network’s flagship site where they can learn about upcoming events. The 
       state of Oregon uses Active Network to manage their campground sites, so when a user clicks on a specific campground they are 
       directed to reserveamerica.com where they can book their reservation. Active Network powers shape.com and when users click to 
       register for local events they are redirected to Active.com. 

       Client Case Studies 
       Below we present three specific case studies of actual ACTV clients that have had success managing their event registrations via 
       Active’s solutions over a multi-year time period. While the first two cases demonstrate particularly strong results, Case 3 represents 
       the average Active Network client organization, and shows that even the typical customer can experience a significant benefit from the 
       relationship. 

       Case 1: Celtic Solstice Five-Miler  
       The Celtic Solstice Five-Miler is a premier five-mile race held every December in Baltimore, Maryland. The event is organized by 
       Baltimore Running, and the company has commissioned Active Network to manage registrations for the five-mile race every year 
       since 2001. Active Network helped Baltimore Running increase revenues throug2000200120022003200420052006h increased participation20072008 and reduce costs through 20092010

       Active Network Contribution  
       The five-mile race had 123 customers in 2000, the year before Baltimore Running hired Active Network to take over event 
       management responsibilities. Since hiring Active Network in 2001, participation has increased to 2,999 runners, growing at a CAGR 
       of 37.6% from 2000-2010. Additionally, total Celtic Solstice revenues increased from $3,075 to $146,951, a CAGR of 47.2%.

       Baltimore Running started realizing financial benefits within the first year of hiring Active Network; these benefits are shown in 
       Exhibit 35. The Company experienced cost reductions related to wages and supplies of $156, and Active Network added 115 
       participants, which accounted for 42% of all runners in 2001, with increased revenues of $2,875. (Active Network defines added 
       participants as participants that register for a given event through the Active Network platform.) Total costs paid to Active Network 
       were $311, implying a return on investment of 975% for Baltimore Running. In addition, the majority of the costs paid to Active 
       Network by Baltimore Running were passed onto event participants.

      Active Network reduced 2010 race operating expenses by $578, driven by wage and supply reductions. Through marketing and 
      various race promotions, Active Network increased total registrations by 1906 participants. The majority of participants, 1761, learned 
      about the race as they navigated through the Active Network site, while 94 registered after receiving a newsletter and 49 found out 
      about the race through Active Network’s social networking initiatives. The increase in runner participation increased Baltimore 
      Running’s race revenues by $92,050, while costs paid to Active Network were only $13,008. Based on the fee paid to Active 
      Network, the associated cost reductions and revenue increases imply an ROI of 712%.  

      Active Network Contribution  
      Active Network eliminates event registration friction, which helps drive growth in total participants and revenues. The company fully 
      integrates itself with the organization’s site, and then brings customers to the Active Network site to provide users with information

      Case 2: Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation & Tourism  
      The Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation & Tourism, similar to Baltimore Running, experienced immediate success once it 
      transferred reservation/registration management over to the Active Network event management platform, but on a much larger scale. 
      Active Network helped the Department save on administrative and accounting costs, introduced new cost-cutting initiatives, and 
      provided valuable analytics to help improve organizational efficiencies for campground reservations.

2010 Cost of Active NetworkMost event organizers are more focused on the operation of the event than on the functionality of their $461,099registration process. However, 
      as the registration provider will likely interact with a majority of the organization’s participants, the organizer will be very sensitive to 
      any problems in the registration process; system reliability is of the utmost importance to gain the client’s trust. Thus, once a 
      functional system is in place, organizers are generally not inclined to switch providers, unless there is a highly compelling reason to do 
      so. For this reason, acquiring the current provider might be the least expensive way to add new customers. 

      Entering a new vertical or geographical region can present an additional challenge, as Active Network may not have the reputation, 
      expertise, or track record in the target community. Here, again, acquisition may be the most efficient vehicle for entry, as it 
      immediately provides an established relationship and local expertise, which can be used to approach other, similar organizations.  

      An example of this approach is Active Network’s recently acquired Fellowship Technologies, an online church management software 
      provider that manages over 300,000 churches in North America. The acquisition immediately gave ACTV a meaningful presence in 
      the faith-based vertical, an accomplishment that could have taken significantly longer had management attempted to grow organically.  

      M&A History 
      In the past 13 years, Active Network has undergone three mergers and 27 acquisitions which have provided the company with access 
      to new customer bases across North America. 

      Mergers 
      Early in the company’s history, it underwent several mergers with complementary businesses to build out the technological capability 
      and breadth of offerings. In 1999, Active Network merged with Racegate.com, an event web portal and event management service 
      provider, to form ActiveUSA.com as the largest recreational sports portal. In 2000, Active Network merged with Sierra Digital Inc. to 
      provide online registration services to outdoor recreation enthusiasts. In 2001, the company merged with Myteam.com, a leading 
      center for online team sports marketing and community. In addition, Leagelink and ActiveUSA (an Active Network subsidiary) 
      merged in 2001.

      Large Acquisitions 

      Class Software Solutions - October 2004 
      In October 2004, Active Network acquired Class Software Solutions for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition provided technology 
      solutions and access to community service agencies that included local governments, park and recreation agencies, community 
      centers, etc. Class Software Solutions, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company, had 700 customers and $12 million in annual 
      revenue. This ACTV subsidiary has grown to generate $33 million in revenue with 1,800 customers in 2010.  

      RegOnline – January 2008 
      In January 2004, Active Network acquired RegOnline for $47 million. RegOnline is an event management software provider and the 
      largest service provider by revenues for corporate and independent organizations. RegOnline, a Colorado-based company, had a wide 
      range of recognized corporations as customers such as Hitachi, Burger King, Sony and more.  

      Outdoor Central – November 2008 
      In October 2004, Central Trust Bank’s Conservation Licensing Division and Outdoor Central and its wholly owned subsidiary 
      Outdoor Central was acquired by ACTV for an undisclosed amount. Outdoor Central processed hunting and fishing licenses for 24 
      state government agencies and after the acquisition, Active Network became the largest provider of hunting and fishing licensing 
      technology in the U.S. by the number of licenses processed. 

      Reserve America – January 2009 
      In January 2009, Active Network acquired IAC’s Reserve America segment in a 3.5 million convertible preferred stock swap deal 
      totalling $50 million. Reserve America, a campground reservation provider, managed over 300,000 campgrounds in major North 
      American National Parks. This acquisition positioned Active Network as the leading outdoor recreation technology provider by the 
      number of registrations managed.

     Challenge of M&A Integration 
     Although Active Network management has shown a knack for business combinations, the acquisition of new companies can pose a 
     significant integration challenge. On top of the cultural and operational matters that arise in a typical acquisition, Active Network 
     faces an additional challenge in the integration and assimilation of new technology platforms. As the company does not want to 
     disrupt the customer’s experience, the transition process is undertaken so as to be as seamless as possible to any user, an effort that can 
     increase the overall expense base.   

     Active Network has embarked on a very significant initiative, started in 2008, to consolidate all its acquired systems and platforms 
     onto one core singular software solution, referred to as ActiveWorks, that can be leveraged across any organization or event. When 
     Active Network acquires a company with its own proprietary registration system, end-customers on that system can often not 
     immediately be ported over to ACTV’s core platform, as each vertical has nuances and services that are unique. As a result, the 
     company must operate both the acquired and internal systems simultaneously and thus incur double the typical expense run rate for 
     software maintenance in many cases. The ActiveWorks project aims to consolidate all acquired software platforms onto a single 
     solution, thus eliminating the duplicative costs from running redundant systems in parallel.  

     Even with the ActiveWorks initiative in place, there will still be a transition period for acquired software platforms, which can be 
     quite lengthy in some cases. Some integrations will be nearly immediate, where customer information and data processing can simply 
     be migrated onto the ActiveWorks platform, whereas in other cases the acquired platform will still need to be operated independently 
     for years before ACTV is able to shut it down completely. 

     Active Network views the integration of an acquired products and systems in three stages – the enduring stage, the maintenance stage, 
     and the migration stage – during which time the acquired system is referred to as EOL (“End of Life”), as it is being phased out. 
     Associated costs are thus also referred to as EOL expenses and are recognized in R&D on the income statement. As noted, depending 
     on the level of complication associated with an acquired software product or system, it may fall into different stages of the integration 
     process – i.e., some acquisitions will immediately migrate to the ActiveWorks platform, while others might spend nearly a decade in 
     the EOL stage before all clients are transitioned to ACTV systems.

new feature development and        continue maintenance and                migration 
     As displayed in Exhibit 41, the company is on various stages of development of the new ActiveWorks platform, and acquired systems 
    limited integration           support for existing customers 
     are being transitioned over accordingly. I2-4 yr feature n the Enduring stage, a two- to three-year process, the products and systems continue

     companies also occurs during this phase, which can take 3-4 years. In the Maintenance stage, a two- to four-year process, Active 
     Network will only provide service and maintenance to existing customers with no further feature development. Finally, in the 
     Migration stage, a one- to two-year process, the legacy system will shut down and clients will be transferred to the main platform. As 
     there are many nuances and variables to consider, it is also possible that certain systems move from any one of the three stages to the 
     ActiveWorks completed integration.ActiveWorks

In 2010, EOL expenses were $22 million or ~8% of total revenues, compared to $30 million or ~12% of total revenues in 2009. While 
we do not model EOL expenses separately, we expect they will increase by several million in 2011 due to recent additional M&A 
activity. In 2012 and beyond, ACTV expects to see a meaningful decrease in EOL expenses, and resulting leverage is an important 
component of the margin expansion thesis. However, further acquisitions could introduce new EOL systems which must be 
maintained, thus making target margins more difficult to achieve.

International Overview 
Active Network currently processes over 20 million event registrations annually across 38 countries and in 10 different currencies. As 
displayed in Exhibit 42, ACTV has 13 local dedicated websites across the world. In addition, Active Network has over 40 staff 
members across Europe and Australia as well as over 400 technology employees in China.

Exhibit 43 below displays Active Network’s homepages for Australia, France, and the U.K. The organization and the functionality of 
the three sites below, as well as all of the remaining international sites, are all comparable to Active Network’s flagship U.S. site. 
Although Active Network will adjust sites to fit local language, cultural or regional trends, the foundations of the sites are relatively 
homogenous across the world. The international opportunity for Active Network is focused on leveraging its existing relationships, 
experience and platform for use in new markets.

International Opportunity 
International expansion represents a significant growth opportunity for Active Network over the next 5-10 years. The company 
estimates that Europe’s event registration TAM is approximately US$10 billion, similar to the North American TAM. The Asian 
markets also represent a large opportunity, although it remains difficult to quantify. Combined, Active Network’s total international 
opportunity is likely more than twice that of the domestic opportunity.  

In 2005, ACTV generated less than $1 million in international revenue. By 2007, international expansion became a significant point of 
emphasis for the management team, opening the Australian office that year and expanding into the U.K. one year later with its London 
office. Since 2005, ACTV has grown international revenues by a CAGR of ~75%, and in 2010, the company grew international 
revenues 152% year-over-year. Active Network has not engaged in any meaningful international M&A; therefore, effectively all of its 
international revenue growth has been achieved organically.

  Today, the company is primarily focused on expanding its operations in the U.K., France, Germany, Australia/New Zealand and 
  Singapore. The company’s decision to focus on these five regions is in line with consumer trends in those particular countries, where 
  online, credit card, and smartphone penetration rates are similar to the U.S. and Canada, and therefore participants and organizations 
  are likely ready to handle online registration formats. Although international revenues remain small on an absolute basis, growth 
  should remain high for several years, enabling meaningful revenue contribution in the future.

       Valuation & Price Target  

       We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x sales. We take an 

       average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and 

       we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.
3) Complications from M&A integration.

Conflicts Disclosures
This product constitutes a compendium report (covers six or more subject companies). As such, RBC Capital Markets chooses to
provide specific disclosures for the subject companies by reference. To access current disclosures for the subject companies, clients
should refer to https://www.rbccm.com/GLDisclosure/PublicWeb/DisclosureLookup.aspx?entityId=1 or send a request to RBC CM
Research Publishing, P.O. Box 50, 200 Bay Street, Royal Bank Plaza, 29th Floor, South Tower, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors, including total
revenues  of  the  member  companies  of  RBC  Capital  Markets  and  its  affiliates,  a  portion  of  which  are  or  have  been  generated  by
investment banking activities of the member companies of RBC Capital Markets and its affiliates.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy
RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls
RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.
