Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $27.50 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of
   return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.
