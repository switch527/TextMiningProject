                                                      Teavana Holdings, Inc. (TEA-NYSE) has a strong combination of a distinctive

                                                      store environment, attractive secular trends and a visible gross margin tail – we
          12-Mo. Price Target                $28.00   initiate with a BUY rating. The Company’s 19% operating margin is one of the highest
          Dividend                            $0.00   in our coverage universe. We believe the Company has continued margin expansion
                                                      opportunity as the penetration of loose tea increases from store maturation. Also, our

          52-Wk. Range                    $14 - $29   model; we think this helps institutionalize the highly consultative nature of the business.

           First Call     --     $0.47E    $0.61E     that stimulates the senses evokes lululemon athletica. We think these attributes that
           P/E          69.7x     49.6x     37.8x     differentiate the store experience are important in the age of internet retailing.

                                                      TEA has a leading position in the secularly attractive specialty tea market. Eighty-
                                                      five percent of TEA's products are blends, which we think adds an element of stickiness
                                                      to the consumer offer. Despite the ubiquity of tea, the Company does not have a national
                                                      specialty retail competitor that offers high quality loose tea. Our analysis indicates that
                                                      Teavana is generally the only loose tea retailer located in its shopping centers.

                                                      Store operating metrics are some of the strongest in our coverage and loose
                                                      tea penetration provides a gross margin tail. The Company has roughly $1,000 in
                                                      sales PSF, one of the highest in our coverage universe. Moreover, we view its 60%
                                                      gross margin as defensible given a positive tailwind from higher penetration of loose
                                                      tea (600-800+ bps maturation mix benefit). The Company continues to see strong
                                                      performance from its most recent store vintages, and we believe that store performance
                                                      from smaller markets will remain strong.

VALUATION
At 37.8x 2012E P/E, 4.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.2x 2012E PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high growth retailer. The stock is up
over 32% from its $17 IPO price, compared to an 8% gain in the S&P 500 Index over the same time period. We think the Company can
sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program, strong new store economics and
multi-year runway for gross margin expansion compared to the specialty retail peer group. Thus, we think TEA deserves to trade at a
premium to the high growth retail peer group averages of 30.1x 2012E P/E, 3.0x 2012E EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012E PEG. We establish
a $28 price target, which implies a 47.1x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate. We think the multiple is fair given the Company's
earnings profile and compelling unit growth opportunity.

RISKS
Risks that could impede the stock from achieving our price target:
TEA is moving into smaller markets. The Company has 196 stores, and a number of new stores will be opened in shopping malls with
lower average sales per square foot than the malls in which the Company currently has a presence. New stores will generally operate
at lower gross margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, compared to mature stores. Our estimates could be
at risk if the Company is unable to identify suitable locations to open new stores, obtain favorable lease terms, attract customers, hire
and retain personnel, and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow to support expansion.

While we see few national competitors, the tea market remains highly competitive. The U.S. tea market remains highly fragmented
with low barriers to entry. Our estimates could be at risk if the Company is unable to provide a differentiated, superior customer
experience and attract more business than its regional and local competitors.

Management,  particularly  founder  and  CEO  Andrew  Mack,  has  been  instrumental  in  the  development  of  the  concept;
continued involvement is a key area of our investment thesis. Having founded the Company in 1997, CEO Andrew Mack has
hired experienced senior managers to implement the Company's long-term growth strategy. The potential sudden departure of key
management executives would likely impact the stock price in a significant manner, in our opinion.
