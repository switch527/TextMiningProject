                   than MSe $0.09 and in line with cons $0.10. 1Q sales            Mkt cap, curr (mm)                              $663

                   $45.1M. Comps (incl. e-com) increased +1.7%. Gross 
                   margins were higher than expected at 64.1% vs. MSe 
                   63.0% (+1c), offset by higher SG&A of 46.2% vs. our 
                   44.5% estimate (-1c) resulting in operating margin 
                   50bps lower than MSe 14.4%. 

                   Store only transaction trends still concerning. 1Q 
                   same store transactions (excluding e-commerce and 
                   beverage only) of -3.0% resumed negative trends 
                   (-1.8% in 2Q11, -2.5% in 3Q11) after reversing in 4Q11 
                   (+1.6%). Including beverage sales, store only comps 
                   were -0.1% (vs. MSe +2.0%) driven by -0.3% 
                   transactions and +0.2% average ticket. We are 
                   concerned about the companys future ability to drive 
                   traffic and maintain positive comps. 

                   Store openings drive growth. TEA opened more new 
                   doors than expected (23 vs. 18-20 guidance) in the 
                   quarter, ending with 223 stores. FY store opening plan 
                   remains on track for 60 new stores.  

                   Inventory/sqft growth decreases -7.7%. The direct 
                   sourcing initiative continues to lower inventory levels 
                   after seeing large increases last year. Total inventory 
                   growth slows to 25.9% vs. a 51.7% 4Q increase and 
                   compared to 26.8% sales growth in the quarter. 

                   Teaopia transaction 2c dilutive in 2Q but neutral to 
                   2012 guidance. Q2 guidance calls for 13-14 new stores 
                   and sales between $38 to $40M on +L-MSD comps and 
                   EPS range of $0.02 to $0.03 (vs. MSe 2c). Transaction           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
