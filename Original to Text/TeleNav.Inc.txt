  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

       New growth legs are beginning to gather strength 
       The challenge for Telenav remains its ability to regain investor confidence in its 
       long-term potential. This process will take  time as the market waits for meaningful 
       contribution from non-carrier businesses. As such, we reiterate our Hold rating. 

       Raising estimates and price target from $8 to $11, maintain Hold rating 
       We have valued Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 2% 
       perpetual growth rate in line with long-t erm industry growth and a 15% discount 
       rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta  of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%). Downside 
       risks include the threat of continued com  petition from free navigation providers 
       such as Google. Upside risks include the potential for increased ramp in premium 
       services and a better than advertising results from Sprint customers in 2011.

29 April 2011       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                              

                               Good results and guidance 
                               Telenav reported Q4 results of $57 million, incl  uding a one-time payment from Ford of $6 
                               million. Excluding this the company still beat  our estimate and consensus of $49 million. Pro-
                               forma EPS of $0.27 also beat expectations of  $0.18. The company continue to demonstrate 
                               steady growth and operating leverage of   its SAAS revenue model. However, we remain 
                               cautious about trends affecting the navigati   on market particularly in regards to carrier 
                               ordering trends. We reiterate our Hold rating. 

                               Growth in all segments, with non-carrier businesses growing 
                               The company saw better than expected subscri ber growth and further diversification away 
                               from AT&T and Sprint. The two combined cont ributed only 70% of revenue in the quarter, 
                               down from over 90% in the past. This in part  reflects new payment terms from Sprint. More 
                               encouraging, the non-carrier business reache  d 19% of revenue, stripping out the Ford 
                               payment this figure stood at 8%, and the company continues to believe this can reach 13% 
                               by the end of FY12. The company continues to build its advertising business expanding it 
                               work with ad networks and its own internal direct sales effort.  

                               New growth legs are beginning to gather strength 
                               We view the companys long-term prospects as being built around consumer rather than 
                               carrier-oriented businesses. They  are continuing to make progress on the various growth 
                               initiatives. In China, they have finally launched nationwide service on China Mobiles network. 
                               This opportunity will take some time to mature,  but the sheer size of the installed base holds 
                               promise, and the move to national  availability is an important milestone. The companys ad 
                               business continues to gain pace, as noted ab  ove. This could even tually become the major 
                               engine of the companys growth, however the mobile ad market is in very early stages of 
                               discovery. Finally, we believe the company is well  positioned to compete in the shifting auto 
                               OEM landscape. They are already deep into their  partnership with Ford. We believe that over 
                               the next 12 months other OEMs will expand th eir navigation partners hips. For instance, we 
                               believe GM is working to revamp its OnStar offering. While we have no reason to believe that 
                               Telenav has won any such business, we think they are a strong competitor in the space. 

                               The challenge for Telenav remains its ability to regain investor confidence in its long-term 
                               potential. This process will take some time as the market waits for more meaningful 
                               contribution from non-carrier businesses. As such, we reiterate our Hold rating. 

                               Raising price target from $8 to $11 to reflect revised estimates. 

                               We are raising our numbers as below.

                               We are raising our price target from $8 to     $11 in line with our revised estimates. Our 
                               valuation is based on a discounted cash flow   analysis using a 2% perpetual growth rate in 
                               line with long-term industry growth and a 15%d  iscount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a 
                               beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%).

29 April 2011       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                                

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei      r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin     g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.      We would also see upside risk should the 
                                companys mobile ad platform take off sooner than expected.

Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular,  this will typically occur  for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

                                         •   Paying subs increased to 22.5M from 19.6M last quarter, representing 54% y/y 
                                             and 15% q/q growth. Notable here is Sprint has recently started to bundle turn-by-
                                             turn into its Boost prepaid wireless subscribers. 

                                         •   ARPU of $0.71 vs. $1.02 last year and $0.80 last quarter. The decline was 
                                             expected due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings and, to a greater 
                                             extent, the Sprint re-negotiation. Starting in FQ1/12, management will steer away 
                                             from providing this metric. 

                                         •   $6.6M of revenue came from catch-up payments triggered by amendments to 
                                             TNAV’s Ford agreement executed in March 2011 that now recognizes revenue 
                                             when vehicles including TNAV’s on-board navigation product are produced vs. 
                                             ratably over a multi-year period. The per-auto fee did not change, but the pace 
                                             and timing of revenue recognition did, making this more of a “one-time’ event. We 
                                             believe the amended agreement does, however, provide for a larger opportunity 
                                             within Ford going forward. 

                                         •   Revenue from automotive, enterprise LBS, mobile advertising and ecommerce was 
                                             8% of total revenue in the quarter (excluding the Ford one-time payment) vs. 7% 
                                             last quarter. Including revenue from the Ford contract, it was 19%. Exiting the 
                                             June quarter, this segment should be approximately 13% of consolidated revenue, 
                                             showing solid and continued progress.  

                                         •   China Mobile is expected to formally launch its branded turn-by-turn services 
                                             (powered by TNAV) across all of China in March 2012. China Mobile is moving 
                                             from eight regional carrier trial to all 26 carriers covering all of China. Together 
                                             with this roll-out, China mobile is lowering the overall cost to the end consumer 
                                             and expects also to invest in marketing initiatives. It is difficult to determine the 
                                             potential impact here, but we do note China Mobile has approximately 600M 
                                             wireless subscribers today.

         stock repurchase plan authorized in November 2010. 

    •   Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter was $211M, up from $156M in 
         FQ2/11. Net cash per share increased to $4.68 from $3.47 last quarter. CFO of 
         $64M in the quarter vs. $28M last quarter and ($1.9M) last year. 

    •   FQ4/11E revenue/pro forma EPS guidance of $52M-$54M/$0.18-$0.20 vs. 
         consensus of $49.6M/$0.17. 

    •   F2011E revenue/pro forma EPS guidance of $208M-$210M/$0.98-$1.00 vs. 
         consensus of $198M/$0.86 and previous guidance of $195M-$200M/$0.79-$0.83. 

ESTIMATES 

Our FQ4/11 estimate ticks up on the heels of the strong FQ3/11 report. Our revenue 
estimate goes to $53M from $50M, sitting at the midpoint of guidance, while our pro forma 
EPS estimate of $0.20 (up from $0.16) is at the high-end of guidance. 

Our F2011 estimates were increased, as well, with our new revenue/pro forma EPS 
estimates of $209M/$0.98 falling in the mid/low-end of the guidance range. Our pro forma 
EPS estimate gets a bump up from both better revenue and gross margin assumptions. 

Our F2012 estimates remain relatively unchanged, with the slight bump up in revenue and 
pro forma EPS being driven by the strong FQ3/11 report.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 
Our new $17 target (up from $15.25) implies just 7x our new 2012 EV/EBITDA estimate 
and 12.5x our new 2012 adjusted EPS estimate, plus net cash per share. Both multiples 
are unchanged from prior valuation. Continued success in non-carrier revenues holds the 
potential to support higher valuation multiples in the future. Maintain BUY. 

INVESTMENT RISKS 
Investment risks include, but are not limited to, customer concentration, competition, 
scalability, intellectual property and regulation.

                                                                          $209.7M, up from $198.5M to reflect the incr  ease in guidance from the company.

                                                                                                                                                                      April 29, 2011
 
     For Q411, we have increased our expense estimates to $27.6M, up   from $26.9M, which is near the upper end of guidance provided   by 
     management at between $27M and $28M. 
     Based on current evidence, it appears that Telenav performance is  exceeding our expectations, and  it does not appear that there  are any 
     known bumps along the way (at least in the short-term). As a result, we are also increasing our revenue estimate for FY12 to $                                                242.1M, 
     up from our previous FY12 estimate of $230.5M. Our new FY12 esti mate infers a 15% YoY growth ra te from our new FY11 estimate  of 
     $209.7M. We maintain a 15% YoY growth forecast, which is consistent with our previous forecast but from a higher base. 
     The quarterly trajectory accelerated slightly in H212 due to th  e potential impact of China Mobi le deployments, which appear to  be on 
     schedule. Our Q112 revenue forecast increases to $56.2M, up from our previous FY12 estimate of $53.5M. 
UPSIDE POTENTIAL TO OUR FORECAST 
     Even as we increase our forecasts, there are potential upside events that could positively impact performance: 
        o   Although the Delphi contract is baked into our estimates, there is a possibility that TNAV could sign new automotive OEM partne rs, 
             or expand its relationship with current clients like Ford. 
        o   The Verizon iPhone 4 program could take off. 
        o   New international mobile operators could come online within the next four quarters. 
        o   New advertising, commerce, and value-added services partnerships could come online. 
        o   Telenav may leverage its balance sheet to make accretive acquisitions. 
     Based on the potential for new opportunities for Telenav over the   next few quarters, there is a chance that it could grow by mo  re than 
     15% during FY12. Between FY10 and FY11, the company should gr  ow by about 19% based on its current FY11 guidance, so there i  s 
     evidence that Telenav could grow by more than 15%. 
VALUATION 
     Consistent with our recent initiating report, we are valuing the company based on a 7x FY12 EV/EBITDA multiple, which is inlin e with the 
     median of its immediate peers at 7.2X FYE+ 1 EV/EBITDA multiple. Considering that its growth trajectory and EBITDA margins are b  oth 
     higher than the peer set, and it does not look like it is declining any time soon, we argue that Telenav should be valued at le                                                       ast 
     equivalent to the peer set. Currently Telenav has no debt with                              $211.3M of cash  and cash equiva                  lents and trades at 3.2X FY12 
     EV/EBITDA. Based on a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple  of our new FY12 EBITDA estimate of $82.1M, up from $79.4M, the implied share price                                                           
     calculates to $18.90.  As a result, we reiterate our BUY recommendation, and  increase our 12-month share price target to 
     $18.90 from $16.80. The implied return from yesterdays closing share price is 65%. 
     Our EV/EBITDA multiple valuation is supported by our DCF model   calculation, which values the co mpany at $19.18 based on a disco unt 
     rate of 11.5% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. 
RISKS 
     We believe that we have properly estimated expenses, although th e company has stated that there is upward pressure on wages in  both 
     China and in the Valley. 
     China Mobile may not roll-out as expected, although indications are that it is on target. 
     Although it is declining, Telenav has customer concentration risk, with over 70% of revenues coming from two large clients. 
     The mobile sector is exceptionally litigious, and Telenav may need to defend its IP position against a third-party, which could                                                  impair 
     margins. 
     The competitive landscape could shift unexpectedly, impairing short-term performance.

                                      •  Guidance is ahead of expectations.  TNAV looks for F4Q PF EPS of $0.18-$0.20 
                                         on revenue of $52-$54mm (JPM prior est $0.16/$49.4mm, street $0.17/$50.2mm).  
                                         We are adjusting estimates to align, and we are taking up estimates through CY12, 
                                         primarily because gross margins are not d  eclining as rapidly as we anticipated, 
                                         notwithstanding the shift to fixed revenues at Sprint.   

                                      •  We maintain a Neutral Rating for TNAV , but we believe an upward re-rating to 
                                         the multiple is justified by three quarters of solid execution following the 
                                         disappointing revision to the Sprint contract that took place in July 2010.  Our Price 
                                         Target goes to $13.00 based on 6 times revised CY12E EV/EBITDA of $64.3mm, 
                                         a one-turn increase to the multiple.

                                     Valuation  

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is close to fully 
                                     valued, in our view, and  we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     improved metrics relating to the growth of auto, premium and ad-based navigation 
                                     services, and better visibility into re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth. 

                                     Our December 2011 price target is $13.00 based on an assigned multiple of 6 times 
                                     revised CY12E PF EBITDA of $64.3mm (previously $58.1m).  Our revised multiple 
                                     is one turn closer to the mean for the comms software/services peer group current 
                                     median multiple of ~7x, but with a discount that takes into consideration significant 
                                     shifts and risks in the competitive landscape (free navigation solutions, Android 
                                     gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining share in autos). 

                                     Risks to Rating and Price Target 

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                              and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                              navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                              expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                              market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                              growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                              reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                              TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                              owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                              leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate. 

                                                                                                                      3

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

 TeleNav Reports Strong Quarter And Raises Guidance

 TeleNav reported fiscal 3Q11 results and hosted a conference call after the close on April 28. Financial results and subscriber metrics
 were better than expected. Management raised fiscal 2011 guidance and issued fiscal 4Q11 guidance above our estimates.

 Financial Results
 Third  quarter  revenues  were  16.1%  ahead  of  our  forecast,  while  adjusted  EBITDA  was  47%  ahead;  note  that  reported  financial
 measures included a $6.6M benefit from the renegotiation of TeleNav's terms with Ford. GAAP EPS of $0.25 was 9c ahead of our
 estimate and 7c ahead of street consensus of $0.18.

 TeleNav's Mobile Navigation Business Continues To Grow
 TeleNav grew its subscriber base to an average of 22.5M users, ahead of our estimates. This was helped by the recent launch of
 bundled service for Boost Mobile subscribers and the launch of nationwide service via the China Mobile brand. TeleNav may look to
 acquisitions (using its available cash) to speed entry into new geographies in the future. TeleNav also diversified its revenue base -
 during the quarter, Sprint and AT&T represented 36% and 34% of revenues respectively, down from 44% and 40% in the December
 quarter.

 Automotive Picking Up Steam
 During the quarter, TeleNav inked a new agreement with Ford that allows TeleNav to recognize revenue as soon as a TeleNav-enabled
 car rolls off the assembly line. Available in 4 cars today, the TeleNav/Ford My Touch system is gaining momentum. Ford accounted
 for 13% of revenues in the third quarter, but this was largely impacted by the $6.6M one-time payment. Adjusting for this, we estimate
 Ford would have accounted for less than 2% of revenues in the quarter. Still, TeleNav expects Ford to be one of TeleNav's largest and
 growing customers (but will not account for more than 10% of revenues in the June quarter).

 Management Raises Guidance
 In addition to posting a strong 3Q, TeleNav increased its guidance for the remainder of the year. With only 1 quarter remaining in the
 fiscal  year,  TeleNav  raised  revenue  guidance  by  more  than  5%.  See  Exhibits  2  &  3  for  a  detailed  look  at  our  estimates  versus
 guidance.

 Net net
 TeleNav's  results  were  better  than  expected,  even  when  the  $6.6M  of  one-time  revenues  is  factored-in.  The  company  is  growing
 revenues at a faster than expected rate by increasing its market reach for mobile navigation, selling more premium LBS services and
 through its growing automotive business. We still have some long-term concerns about the competitive environment, but without
 question we are getting increasingly confident that new revenue sources (advertising, automotive and new carrier partnerships) can
 help to mitigate this risk. We are maintaining our Neutral rating, but we are increasing our target to $11 after rolling it forward to fiscal
 2012 (calendar June 2012) and on better revenue growth.

 Changes to our model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by 5.1%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising GAAP EPS
 to $0.92 from $0.80.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                                      •  We expect F4Q11 guidance to be aligned with our estimates.    We look for F4Q PF 
                                        EPS of $0.16 on $49.4mm in revenue (Street: $0.16/$50.2mm). We expect gross margin 
                                        to dip further to 77%; continuing to decline. On 4/19, J.P. Morgan Comm Equipment 
                                        analyst, Rod Hall, reduced his handset forecasts for Q2 and Q3 to account for disruption 
                                        in the supply chain due to Japan, but his 2011 forecasts was only slightly impacted 
                                        (0.4%). Therefore, we dont anticipate a significant impact on TNAV from these handset 
                                        supply chain disruptions.

                                        view, and we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get improved metrics relating

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                              and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                              navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                              expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                              market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                              growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                              reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                              TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                              owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                              leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

                              FIVE REASONS TO BUY THIS STOCK TODAY 
 
                              1)   LBS is rocking and TeleNav is the lead singer:   According to a 2010 Juniper Research study, 1.5 
                                   billion consumer users are forecasted to drive annualized mobile location based services (LBS) revenues 
                                   to $12.7B by 2014.  We believe that through its curren t LBS offerings alone, TeleNav is poised to address 
                                   at least $5.0B of this market.  With 19.6M user    s as of December 31, 2010, Telenav has the largest 
                                   revenue-generating consumer LBS user base amongs t over 6,000 LBS related ve ndors globally. TeleNavs 
                                   success in its core mobile navigation platform is a  key enabler of other location based opportunities such 
                                   as mobile advertising, in-dash automotive navigation, and mobile resource management.  Since going 
                                   public in May of 2010, TNAV has grown its user base by 63%, adding 7M new users.       As a greater 
                                   percentage of revenue is generated from new ma rket segments, and as it  scales as a mobile 
                                   LBS platform, the EV/EBITDA multiple should expand accordingly.             See chart below.

                                                                                  LTM FY'11E  FY'12E
                                                                                                                                            
                              2)   Customers are massive and motivated to drive revenue for TNAV:  Telenav is partnered with 15 
                                   leading carriers with a global footprint of 29 countries who need on-deck LBS apps to maintain subscriber 
                                   stickiness and drive ARPU.  Despite having grown its user base by 63% Y/Y, TeleNav still only has a 7% 
 
                                   penetration rate among 5 US-based carrier clients, which have 275 million subscribers combined. The 
                                   company is just beginning to deploy with leading in ternational mobile operators, where signed contracts 
                                   represent a universe of 720 million potential users.  Wi th third-party off-deck LBS providers like Google 
                                   (GOOG-Q), and AOL threatening to turn carriers into  dumb pipes, TeleNav is a key partner for carriers 
                                   to capture earnings in the rapidly growing market for LBS applications.     
 
                              3)   Post-IPO disaster averted, stock reacts to execution:       One of the potentially unintended 
                                   consequences of the IPO in May of 2010 was to expose  just how much money TNAV was making from its 
                                   largest customer Sprint.  Upon viewing the 45%+  adjusted EBITDA margins and the 24%+ net income 
                                   margins, Sprint may have decided to rebalance the      deal.  Leveraging its customer dominance, Sprint 
                                   forced the contract to be re-opened and re-negotiated. Upon disclosing the renegotiation to the market 
                                   with no assurances of success, TeleNavs shares subsequently plummeted to a low of $4.68.  A month 
                                   later, TNAV announced that Sprint had agreed to new terms and then in October the company 
                                   confounded the market by beating expectations and gu iding higher  despite the Sprint deal.  Then they 
                                   did again in January. Investors bega n to realize that the renegotiated Sprint contract may be better than 
                                   at first glance and that TeleNav is not a broken business.   
                              4)   New Sprint deal  more users, more revenue  streams, better economics:   The new Sprint deal 
                                   benefits TeleNav in two not well understood ways:  i) Because margins improve on scaling, Sprint is 
                                   incented to include Telenav in more data bundles up-s old to more current subscribers, thus accelerating 
                                   the potential user base for Telenav; and ii) by carving out a greater revenue split for Telenav on 
                                   incremental services, TeleNavs top-line becomes more  highly levered to emerging rapid growth areas in 
                                   LBS such as mobile advertising, m-commerce, lead generation, and other emerging revenue models. 
 
                              5)   Free Fear is Overdone:    TeleNavs greatest perceived competit ive risk comes from free mobile 
                                   handset navigation applications, particularly from G oogle.  This threat has be en and continues to be a 
                                   drag on its valuation relative to its peers.  Through solid investments over the past three years, we 
                                   believe the company is mitigating this threat  TeleNa v should earn increasingly higher valuation multiples 
                                   as the company continues to de-risk   the threat of free alternatives  by: i) winning global automotive 
                                   OEM contracts for in-dash navigation with companies like Ford and Delphi; ii) demonstrating the 
                                   effectiveness of its mobile advertising model with drive to rates of 24%; iii) signing deals with leading 
 
                                   global carriers like Vivo and China Mobile; and iv) continuing to penetrate the enterprise.

                              WHO IS TELENAV? 
 
                              Headquartered in Santa Clara California, TeleNav is a      cloud-based provider of location-based applications 
                               delivered to GPS-enabled phones.  TeleNav was incorporated in Delaware in 1999 and went public in May 2010 
                              with a listing on the NASDAQ as TNAV. The company  has 953 employees with 800 engineers, of which about 
                               500 are located in the companys R&D facilities in China.   
                              TeleNavs flagship turn-by-turn (TBT) mobile navigation platform was launched with Nextel (now Sprint) in 
 
                              2002.  Since then they have launched with AT&T, US Cellul ar, T-Mobile as well as leading international carriers 
                               such as China Mobile,  Vivo, and Telcel.  With 19.6M paying users, the company is currently global leader in 
                              mobile navigation.   
                               The companys leadership in mobile navigation platfo    rm has acted as a springboard to adjacent market 
                              opportunities in mobile advertising, mobile commerce , mobile resource management (MRM), and automotive 
 
                              in-dash solutions.  Through significant investments and solid execution across a broad range of vertical 
                               markets, TeleNav has increased it market opportunity to  $5.0B (up from $1.5B) as an end-to-end LBS platform 
                              spanning across multiple distribution channels in      cluding handsets, operating systems, carriers, and

                              CLOUD-BASED, SERVICE DELIVERY ARCHITECTURE 
                              The TeleNav navigation solution is implemented on a   cloud-based architecture, wh ich allows a multitude of 
                              navigation services to be delivered to almost all the  mobile handsets in the market.  The mobile-phone-based 
 
                              navigation application takes basic location readings fr  om GPS signals and cell-tow er triangulation and then 
                              sends them back to TeleNavs servers.  Based on a user s location and desired destination, TeleNav runs map 
                              lookups and routing algorithms at the server level, before sending out the set of instructions to get to a 
                               targeted address.    
                              Since the application essentially exists in the cloud, upgrades to the services or the addition of incremental 
 
                              capabilities can be implemented easily.  Recent additions to the platform include the ability to deliver targeted 
                               mobile advertising or to track a mobile field workers lo cation and progress.  The cloud platform makes it easy 
                              to add content, services, and partners.

                              TeleNavs service delivery system includes a direct connection to the carrier partners back-end, allowing for 
                              seamless authentication and billing.  Carriers bill customers directly and the revenues are passed on to 
                              TeleNav. End users do not have to set up and pay a se  parate bill and TeleNav does not have to develop its 
                              own billing infrastructure or take on additional credit risks.   
 
                              GIS data is pulled from TeleAtlas and Navteq, while POI information comes from multiple third-party sources. 
                              Local advertisements are provided by ad networks such as yp.com, Yelp, or directly from advertisers (e.g., 
                              Darden Restaurants, Holiday Inn, etc.).  TeleNavs application programming interfaces (APIs) allow third party 
                              developers to connect TeleNav's location-based services, such as turn-by-turn directions and location sharing, 
                              to their mobile and web applications. This helps developers reach the companys 20 million subscribers and 
                              enables seamless navigation and location sharing acro ss all major mobile operat ing systems on hundreds of 
                              devices supported by the networks of TeleNav's carrier partners.

concentration should 
decline with fastest        Almost 100% of TeleNavs revenue is recurring and subs cription-based, providing the company with excellent 
                              visibility.  Over the past three fiscal years ended June 30, TNAV achieved a revenue CAGR of 89% - growing 
growth coming from       from $48.1M in FY08 to $171.2M in FY 10.  Revenue growth to date has pr imarily been driven by Sprint and 
new segments              AT&T which represented 61% and 29% of FY09 revenue and 55% and 34% of FY10 revenue.   
                              During Q211, TeleNav reduced its revenue concentration from Sprint and AT&T to 44% and 40% of total 
                              revenue respectively.  Q211 revenue from US Cellular and T-Mobile grew by 169% Y/Y to account for $4.3M 
                              or 9% of total revenue, up from $1.6M in Q210.  We expect this trend to continue and we see Sprint/AT&T 
                              revenue concentration declining considerably to 35%     and 31% by FY12 as the company ramps up its 
                              deployments with new carrier partners, new automotive OEMs, and new content providers.   
                              While management has not delineated specific contribution from automotive, mobile advertising, and MRM, 
                              they indicated that the company is on track to exit FY11 with a run-rate of about 10% of total revenues from 
                              these business segments.  This is up from 7% of total Q211 revenue.

                               REVENUE FORECAST ASSUMPTIONS  
                                    Carrier TBT Navigation:  We believe that Sprint currently pays about $20M per quarter in its fixed fee 
 
                                    contract with TeleNav until Decemb er 2012.  We expect Sprint to ro  llover the agreement but at lower 
                                     successive rates.  Our forecast also assumes that a majority of TeleNavs US carrier partners will migrate 
                                    to fixed fee arrangements by H213.  For its international carrier partners, we are forecasting modest until 
                                     network infrastructure begins to mature in emergi      ng markets.   Based on the current pace capital 
                                    spending on equipment and infrastructure, we expect this to occur by 2013.         
 
                                    Automotive:  For FY12 and beyond, we expect rapid gr  owth from TeleNavs automotive revenues as 
                                     SYNC navigation becomes a standard feature in all Fords and MyTouch gains traction amongst 
                                    consumers.  We do not anticipate any contribution from Delphi until H212 as automakers typically take 
                                     between one and two years to begin production once they have chosen their suppliers. 

                                    Mobile Advertising:  We see advertising as a key growth driver for the company given the breadth of 
                                    their platform and early success with drive-to-rates.  However, since TeleNavs advertising platform was 
                                     only launched in September 2010, we expect limited   advertising revenue in the near term.  While we 
                                    anticipate rapid growth from this segment, it will be from a small base.  Consequently, we are not 
                                     modeling mobile advertising as a 10% revenue contributor until FY13.  

                                    Enterprise MRM:  To date, TeleNav has relied primarily on it s carrier partnerships with AT&T and Sprint 
                                    as sales channels for their MRM business.  Given that TeleNavs two most direct competitors also sell 
                                     through the same channels and the undifferentiated core product suites, we are modeling in modest 
                                    growth in this segment.  We could become more constructive about TeleNavs MRM business if company 
                                     builds out more direct sales and marketing resources and delivers some solid customer wins over the next 
                                    two quarters.

                              Gross Margin:  TeleNav has historically enjoyed gross margins in excess of 80%, with gross margins of 83% 
                              over the last four quarters.  Management expects this to decline to about 80% by the end of FY11 due to 
                               higher third party data costs as automotive and mobile advertising contribute more to revenue.  Longer term, 
                              management has set a gross margin target range of 72% to 75%.   
                                
                              Adj. EBITDA:  Before reporting adj. EBITDA margins of 38.6%  for Q211, TeleNav had achieved adj. EBITDA 
                               margins in excess of 40% for the prior eight quarters and reported an annual adj. EBITDA margin of 45.9% for 
                              FY10.  During Q211, management di sclosed that 30% of its operating costs were being allocated to strategic 
 
                              growth areas which only contribute to 7% of the companys total revenues today.  As management is 
                               expecting to increase R&D investments to capture a grea  ter share of the growing LBS pie, they guided that 
                              longer term adj. EBITDA would fall in the range of 33% to 36%.  We believe that significant investments in 
                               R&D are the key to TeleNavs future and are forecastin  g more modest longer term adj. EBITDA margins of 
                              about 30%.

                              Net Income:  Driven by historically high gross and operating margins, TeleNav has in the past achieved a net 
                               income margins in the range of 23% to 27%.  Net income is negatively impacted by a high California corporate 
                              tax rate which is currently in excess of 40%.  As intern ational operations begin contributing more to revenue, 
                               we expect the tax rate to decline to about 35%.

                              Due to minimal working capital and capital expenditure  requirements, TeleNav generates a consistent stream 
                               of free cash flow and has a solid debt free balance sh  eet.  In addition to rais ing $44.6M from its May 2010 
                              IPO, the company generated FCF of $36.4M.  During H211, TeleNav added an additional $44.1M in FCF exiting 
                               Q211 with a total cash balance of $155.7M.  We believe  that Sprint made an upfront annual payment of $80M 
                              in January to cover its fixed licensing obligations for 2011 inferring a pro forma cash balance of over $235M or 
                               $5.60 per share.       
                               As of December 31, 2010 there were 42.2 million basic sh ares outstanding and 45.9 million fully diluted shares 
                              outstanding including options.  Insiders control 11.7% of shares outstanding with 49.1% of outstanding shares 
                               retained by its venture capital investors.

                               According to Berg Insight, there were 200 million turn-by- turn installations in North  America and Europe as of 
                                June 2010. Although Personal Navigation Devices (P       ND) such as those offered by TomTom and Garmin 
                               represent the largest install base, navigation enabled phones are the fastest growing category. Of the 44 
                                million phones enabled with TBT navigation as of J une 2010, TeleNavs 16.1M user s accounted for 36.5% of 
                               the market.  We expect that as the penetration of GPS   enabled phones in the market increases, phones will 
                                eclipse PNDs as the access point for TBT navigation.

                              Frost & Sullivan estimates that the market for TeleNavs core on-deck carrier TBT product should grow at a 
                              CAGR of 20% from $614M to over $1.5B by 2015.  This  forecast excludes ad-based revenue but includes up-
                              sells of premium services such as traffic or speed trap   alerts.  Key drivers in the growth of the carrier TBT 
                              navigation market are: 
                                   A.   Pre-loaded TBT is a Strategic Focus for Carriers :  With third-party off-deck LBS providers like 
                                        Google (GOOG-Q), Foursquare, and Where? threatening  to turn carriers into dumb pipes, carriers 
                                        are increasingly turning to TBT navigation to aggressively monetize data, mitigate churn rates and 
                                        declining ARPU.  Carriers view personalization options associated with mobile navigation as a 
                                        potential source of customer loyalty as well as an entry point to a broader array of new revenue 
                                        streams such as mobile advertising and local se  arch.  AT&Ts 411 and yp.com mobile search and 
                                        advertising platforms are deeply integrated with TeleNavs pre-loaded navigator application.   
                                   B.   Proliferation of GPS Enabled Phones :  IDC estimates that only about 16% (205M) of mobile 
                                        phones globally are 3G+ GPS enabled 205M.  As this number almost triples to over 520M by 2014, 
                                        we believe consumers will increasingly turn to their mobile phones for turn by turn navigation as a 
                                        substitute to PND devices.

                              CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES LEADING GLOBAL CARRIERS  
                              Telenav is partnered with 15 carriers with a global footprint of 29 countries representing a potential universe of 
                              720M users globally.  Sprint deployed TeleNavs TBT   navigation product in 2002 and is currently TeleNavs 
                              largest customer representing 44% of total revenues.    TeleNav launched with its second biggest customer, 
                              AT&T in 2007, which now accounts for 40% of total revenues.      
                              Newer US carrier partners US Cellular and T-Mobile      are beginning show traction  with revenue from these 
                              deployments growing 169% Y/Y to $4.3M   in Q211 from $1.6M in Q210.           US Cellular and T-Mobile now 
                              represents 9% of total revenue, up from 6% Y/Y.   
                            
                              Internationally, TeleNav has signed up leading carriers such as China Mobile, Telcel GS, Vivo, and Orange. 
                              China Mobile on its own represents a potential universe of 560 million users.  Revenue from these international 
                              carriers represented 4% of total Q211 revenue, up from 3% Y/Y.  Although the number of potential users in 
 
                              emerging countries such as China and Brazil is staggeri ng, we do not expect material contribution from these 
                              markets until their network infrastructures mature.  These countries also lag North America and Europe in the 
                              adoption of GPS enabled phones.  We  anticipate that significant growth should occur in these markets by late 
                              2013 or early 2014.

                              PRICING MODELS 
                              GPS Navigator revenues are either billed directly to end-users by carriers as a Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) 
 
                              or as part of a bundle of services offered with data plans.  Currently, Sprint is the only carrier bundling the 
                               application as part of its all inclusive data plans.  Users do not have to opt-in as they are not explicitly charged 
                              for the service.  We believe that Sprint pays TeleNa    v a fixed fee of $20M per quarter for the term of its 
                               agreement which ends in December 31 2012.   
                              With the rest of its carrier partners, TNAV operates through a Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) revenue share 
 
                              model.  The TNAV application is typically white-labele d and pre-loaded onto the ca rriers GPS enabled phones 
                               and users have the option to activate the application fo r a monthly fee of $7-$10 which carriers then split with 
                              TeleNav.  Carriers typically offer a free month of service to spur initial user adoption.   
                                  
                              We believe that TBT navigation syst ems will continue to be used as a weapon against off-deck handset-
                               based free services (most notably Google) that disinter mediate subscriber revenue streams. TeleNav is well-
                              positioned as a platform for carriers  to capture a broader array of adve rtising, commerce, and content based 
                               revenue streams. As a result, we pr  edict that TBT navigation will become a standard feature bundled into 
                              personalized subscriber data plans. Consequently, we expect carriers to transition from the MRC model to fixed 
                               fees.  This should result in a rapid expansion of TeleNav s user growth rates as users will no longer explicitly 
                              pay for the service.  In the end, carriers will fight free with free. 
 
                              We believe that some per-unit licensees are likely to    migrate to a similar licensing model as Sprint, which 
                               promotes more users, and revenue sharing for incremental services layered on top of the TBT platform.

                               eMarketer predicts that US mobile advertising will grow at a 43% CAGR from $416M in 2009 to $2.6B by 2014.  
                              To address this market opportunity, TeleNav launched   its location based advertising platform in September 
 
                              2010.  Although not a material contributor to revenue toda y, we believe TeleNav is well positioned to capture 
                               this market opportunity through its large and growing  base of 20M+ users conducting 40M+ local searches per

                              We believe that the cross platform, multi-device, multi- service, and multi-carrier partnerships provide TeleNav 
                              with a competitive edge in mobile advertising as the   fragmented nature of mobile operators, handsets, and 
                              operating systems has made the process of buying and   delivering mobile advertising very complex.  Having 
                              captured the leading share of mobile navigation users  across carriers, platforms and mobile devices, TeleNav 
                              acts as a one-stop shop for publishers to deliver location-based ads.      
                              TeleNavs mobile advertising platform also generates va luable data for advertiser s.  In November 2010, the 
                              company released usage data indicating the brands driver s were most actively searching for while on the road. 
TeleNavs mobile           The top brands were identified by analyzing how freq  uently TeleNav's users entered the brand names as a 
advertising platform       keyword search on its mobile navigation application. The  data revealed leading  brands  in a variety of vertical 
                              industries measured by local search queries.  For instance, TeleNav's data analysis found that six of the top ten

data for advertisers        number one.   
which is still to be

monetized.                  their listings at the top of the search results list and include deals or coupons within their listings to increase 
                              the number of users who visit their locations after conducting a search.     
 
                               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                             
                               
                              REVENUE POTENTIAL FOR U.S. BASED M-ADVERTISING IS SUBSTANTIAL 
                              During Q211, TeleNav reported a click thru rate of  3.5% and a drive-to-rate of  24%.  We believe that the 
                              drive-to-rate results were based on campaigns with seve ral national restaurant, hotel, and retail chains and 
                              estimate that TeleNav generated about $3 per drive to.  The company explained that the high drive-to rate 
                              was because 84% of users were in their cars when sear  ching for a place to go, indicating that search views 
                              occurred when users were at a high point of need.  For instance, display ads or coupons for restaurant 
                              properties would be delivered at the very moment a user is searching for food around their current location. 
 
                              To illustrate the revenue potential of mobile advertising on the TeleNav platform today, we assumed an 
                              average cost per click (CPC) of $0.25 on display ads      and a $3.00 cost per action (CPA) for drive-tos.  
                              Assuming that 24% of users who click thru continue to drive to, we arrive at a total revenue potential today 
                              of $2.4M.  Current revenue potential is limited by the % of users with ad enabled clients as well as a low fill 
                              rate which is a function of the number of advertisers on the network. Both performance limitations should 
                              decline quickly with adoption. 
                              We expect that the number of users with ad enabled cl ients will increase over time to 100% as carriers pre-
                              load them onto handsets anticipation of driving ad   based revenues.  If TeleNav can increase the number of 
                              monthly searches per user and increase its fill rate as more advertisers are added to the network, then at 50% 
                              penetration of its US carrier partners subscriber bases,  the revenue potential increases by a multiple of almost 
                              85x to $203.6M.

                                    Over the next five years, we believe that OEM TBT in-dash navigation could become standard on the majority 
 
                                    of the 25M to 30M passenger cars sold in Europe and North America annually.  ABI Research predicts that over 
                                    60% of these navigation solutions will be connected and software-based by that time.  We estimate that 
                                    TeleNavs total addressable market in the OEM automotive space could be worth as much as $1.5B by 2014.   
                                    Cloud-based TBT will be adopted by automotive OEMs as a substitute to todays unconnected in-dash PND due 
                                    to software cost advantages , advances in on-board connectivity, and to better extensibility to meet changing 
 
                                    customer needs. Additionally, software navigation solu tions can provide drivers with real-time data, and can 
                                    reduce driver distraction through voice interaction.  Te leNavs automotive applications can be integrated with 
                                    all the major operating systems that could be selected by automotive OEMs including Linux, Windows CE, QNX, 
                                    and Android.     
                                    Leveraging its leadership in mobile navigation, TeleNav is the exclusive provider of TBT navigation solutions for 
 
                                    the Fords SYNC and MyTouch in-dash platforms.  SYNC  became available on all Fords beginning in 2010 and 
                                    MyTouch is standard on all Lincoln and high-end Fords.   The SYNC navigation system is strictly voice activated 
                                    and connects to the drivers phone via Bluetooth sending data  over the carriers network.  In addition to all the 
                                    features of SYNC, MyTouch features a visual, touch-screen interface.

                                    In terms of pricing, TeleNav receives a one-time payment for every Ford sold with a MyTouch.  This one-time 
                                    payment is recognized over the term of the contract                 which based on standard OEM contracts, which we 
                                    assume to be five years.  For SYNC, the company receives and recognizes a monthly fee per vehicle. We 
                                    estimate that about 1M cars shipped by Ford this year came equipped with the SYNC or MyTouch systems.

                              The successful deployments with Ford, has opened up ne w opportunities in the automotive in-dash segment.  
                              As part of reporting its Q211 financial results, TeleNav announced a long term deal with Delphi (a tier-1 
                              automotive supplier) to supply its in-dash navigation   software to a second undisclosed global automotive 
                              manufacturer.  We believe that the second OEM could be  Audi who sells 1.5M cars annually.  Additionally, the 
                              recently announced partnership with QNX increases the  potential for new deals with global manufacturers like 
                              Mercedez-Benz, and BMW.  Based on the pricing of       OEM in-dash navigation offerings from TomTom and 
                              Garmin, we believe that TeleNav could generate approximately $50.00 per vehicle.            
                               
 
                              M  OBILE    R ESOURCE       M  ANAGEMENT         (MRM) 
                              TeleNavs Enterprise Mobile Resource Management (MRM) enables companies to manage mobile resources to 
                              enhance productivity and efficiency. Mobile resources in  clude field workers, vehicl es and other assets.  The 
                              MRM market can be broken out into the Field Worker Market and the Automatic Vehicle Location Market (AVL).  
                              AVL focuses on the geographic location of vehicle fleets and is also referred to as telematics. MRM for mobile 
                              field workers are solutions for employees who spend a majority of their time out-of-office such as cable 
                              installers, utility workers, and sales professionals. 
                              Although TeleNav offers both AVL and field worker so     lutions, the company primarily focuses on the field 
                              worker market which we expect to grow at a CAGR        of 46% to $744M in 2013, up from $166M in 2009.  
                              Growth will be primarily driven by adoption of ha    ndset based MRM solutions to improve mobile worker 
                              productivity in combination with a steep decline in the cost of GPS enabled handsets and data plans.  
                              According to Frost & Sullivan, the annual cost of deploying the MRM solution has decreased at a CAGR of 
                              around 27% from $1526/subscriber in 2005 to $538/subscriber in 2009.   
 
                              In addition to real-time alerts, traffic re-routing and TBT navigation, TeleNavs MRM solutions provide 
                              enterprises with the mobile workforce productivity enhancing applications such as wireless timecards, dynamic 
                              scheduling/dispatching, wireless data capture forms,   and back office integratio n.  TeleNav has over 9,000 
                              enterprise customers to date and most recently won a deployment with FedEx.   
                              Similar to its flagship TBT product, TeleNavs key distribution channels for its MRM solutions are the mobile 
                              carriers.  The company is currently partnered with AT&T , Sprint, and Verizon who ar e responsible for tracking 
                              usage information and providing a single bill to customers.  MRM productivity suites are primarily marketed 
                              and sold by the carriers as up-sells to their enterprise customers and then split on a per user basis with 
                              TeleNav.  TeleNav also earns incremental revenue from  professional services in deploying and integrating its 
                              solution with a customers back office.           
 
                               

                              COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 
                              As TeleNav executes its platform strategy and extends its offerings beyond mobile navigation, it competes with 
                              a multitude of segment specialists and potential substi  tutes.  The companys greatest perceived competitive 
                              threat for user share comes from free mobile navigation applications, particularly from Google.  Management 
                              has indicated that the company has ma  de significant investments over the past three years to contain this 
 
                              threat.  During Q211, management disclosed that 30% of  its operating costs were being allocated to strategic 
                              growth areas which only contribute to 7% of the companys total revenues today.  We believe the following 
                              data points support our view that the threat of free may not be as great a risk as investors perceive:  
                              1)   TeleNav is partnered and tightly integrated with larg e carriers whose influence  with handset makers may 
                                   be underestimated.  Carriers have the ability to pre-load and bundle mobile navigation services onto their 
                                   handsets offerings.  As carriers fight to protect data margins in the expanding market place for location 
                                   based services, we could see carriers pressure Android handset makers into not pre-loading Googles 
                                   mobile navigator to minimize Googles control of location content.     
 
                              2)   TeleNavs navigator is available across over 600 smart phones and feature phones: 50% of phones on the 
                                   market today are feature phones without access to free TBT navigation.     
                              3)   With a cross channel, multi-device, multi-OS, and multi-carrier platform, TeleNav simplifies the process of 
                                   buying and delivering mobile content and advertis   ing for advertising partners.  Having captured the 
                                   leading share of mobile navigation users across carr iers, platforms and mobile devices, TeleNav is one-
 
                                   stop shop for publishers to deliver ads.

                                                                                                                        February 25, 2011
  
                               4)   Free navigation apps like Android have actually helped to grow TNAV user base by raising consumer 
                                   awareness. Since Android came to market with free  navigation two years ago, TNAV has doubled its user 
                                    base. 
                               5)   Free navigation apps are not actu  ally free as users still pay for data consumed.  We believe that 
                                   current monthly recurring charge (MRC) carrier partners  are likely to migrate to Sprints bundling model 
                                    which essentially makes TeleNav also free in the perception of users.   
                              6)   The Chinese telecom industry strictly protects state owned carriers like China Mobile.  This provides a 
 
                                   competitive moat in respect of TeleNavs access to China Mobiles 584M subscribers as carriers can use 
                                    government regulations to exclude the use of third party mobile navigation on its handsets.    
                              7)   TeleNavs recurring revenue model and solid balanc     e sheet provides the company with the financial 
                                    flexibility to invest in new strategic areas through acquisitions or organically. 
                               
                              MOBILE NAVIGATION 
                               TeleNavs most direct competitor in the on-deck mobile navigation space is Telecommunications Systems (TCS) 
                              through its acquisition of Networks in Motion (NIM) in No vember 2009.  However, with four of the five largest 
                               carriers in the US signed up and over 20M users, TeleNav has a significant lead.  Other smaller carrier aligned 
                              mobile navigation vendors include Telmap, Jentro, and Appello Systems.   
 
                              TeleNav also competes with numerous other paid TBT navi gation apps available in mobile app stores such as 
                               Sygic and Navigon.  However, TeleNav consistently outp  erforms these apps in the majority of professional 
                              reviews from blogs such as Gizmodo.com, Androidguys.com. and crackberry.com.   
 
                               
                              AUTOMOTIVE 
                               In the automotive segment, TeleNav primarily competes with on-board factory fitted hardware based 
                              navigation devices from vendors such as Garmin an  d TomTom.  These devices are typically unconnected, 
                               difficult to update, and do not provide  drivers with real time information.  In contrast, cloud based navigation 
                              solutions like Fords MyTouch or SYNC offerings provide drivers with the most up to date maps and real time 
                               traffic information as well as points of interest.           
                               Due to their cost advantages to auto makers as well as the benefit of real time data to drivers, ABI Research 
                              predicts that by 2014, connected software-based naviga  tion will dominate hardware based solutions in the 
                               automotive space.  We believe that through its partnerships with Ford, Delphi, and QNX, TeleNav is well 
                              positioned to capture a sizeable piece of the automotive navigation market.   
 
                               
 
                              ENTERPRISE LBS 
 
                              TeleNav distributes its mobile resource management solu  tions to the enterprise through direct and indirect 
                               channels in partnership with Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon.   Each one of these partners also acts as distribution 
                              channels TeleNavs direct competitors in mobile resour ce management. Primary competitors also marketed by 
                               Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon are Xora and ActSoft with limited differentiation in core product functionality.   
                              Despite showing solid traction other areas, although we  believe that the company could face challenges within 
 
                              the highly competitive and complex enterprise MRM segment.  Even as TeleNav competes with Xora and 
                               Actsoft through its mobile operator channels, there are a myriad of competitors with deep expertise in logistics 
                              and supply chain management that sell directly ente      rprises including large players such as Trimble and 
                               Descartes Systems.  There are also numerous point solutions such as telematics, field worker software 
                              vendors, and large hardware vendors such as Ingenico and Intermec that also provide MRM solutions to the 
                               enterprise.

                               VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
                               We are initiating coverage with a target price of $16.  80 based on applying a 7.0x EV multiple to our FY12 
                               EBITDA estimate of $79.5M.  This is supported by our fi ve year DCF value of $16.34 based on a discount rate 
                               of 12% and a terminal growth rate of 3%.   
At 3.7x, TNAV trades at

48% discount to peers 
                               navigation software operating within multiple ecosyste ms including location based services, automotive OEM 
on a F12 EV/EBITDA       suppliers, and carrier software.  The median FY12 multiples within each of these industry silos range from a 
basis. We think it           low of 5.9x in the case of carrier software vendors to       a high of 16.7x in the case of high growth SaaS 
should be closer to the     platforms.   
                                
LBS median of 7.2x. 
                               On an enterprise value basis, TNAV is trading at    3.4x LTM EBITDA of $87.4M and 3.7x our FY12 EBITDA 
                               estimate of $79.5M.  The considerable discount may           reflect investors concerns relating to customer 
                               concentration, the competitive threat  of free alternatives, and the risk  s associated with execution of the 
                               companys strategic growth initiatives.  We believe that  these perceived risks have been overly priced into the 
                               stock.   
                                
                               TeleNav is a high growth company with significant earnin gs leverage and we think as investors see evidence of 
                               continued execution in gaining user share and diversifying  its revenue streams, the stock could eventually earn 
                               multiples in-line with those of high-growth SaaS companies.  However, since 93% of the companys revenue is 
                               currently generated through its core mobile navigation   product, we look to LBS vendors which trade at a 
                               median of 7.2x FY12 EV/EBITDA as the baseline for our valuation.

                               Relative to its publicly traded LBS peers, TeleNav trades at a FY12 EV/EBITDA discount of 48%.  Considering 
                               that TeleNav has achieved a revenue CAGR of 89% over the past three fiscal years while maintaining EBITDA 
                               margins of 40%, we believe that such  a significant discount is unwarranted.  Our target price of $16.80 based 
                               on 7.0x FY12 EV/EBITDA is well supported by our DCF model which values the company at $16.34 per share.

                                              KEY RISKS 
 
                                              Customer Concentration: For some investors potential customer concentration risk became very real during 
                                              the summer of 2010 when Sprint, which currently repr                                      esents approximately 40% of TeleNav revenues, 
                                              unilaterally decided to renegotiate a long-standing                                    contract. The stock declined by 39% after this 
                                              announcement. There is no certainty that AT&T will not behave similarly in the future. The positive news is 
                                              that the company has been successful in reduce customer  concentration, and we predict that by 2013, Sprint 
                                              customer concentration could decline to 35%. 

                                              Competitive Disruption: It is hard to get more disruptive than free, and TeleNav has still managed to 
                                              increase its user base in the face of free service. The next possible level of competitive disruption could be 
                                              competitive vertical consolidation among data providers,  LBS platforms, content providers, and even carriers 
                                              themselves. Vertical consolidation among competitors could cause service disruption, reduced margins due to 
                                              fewer supplier options, and even lost clients if carriers are involved.  TeleNav has a very solid balance sheet

                                               and specifically local advertising. Several smaller players such as Poynt and Where? have patents or patent 
                                              claim continuations that could cause murkiness around intellectual property in the short to medium term. The 
                                              uncertainty regarding patents could increase operating ex                                 penses due to litigation,   and could result in gross 
                                              margin compression if TeleNav is required to pay royalties to third-parties on certain local advertising and 
                                              search methods. 
                                              Content Supply:  TeleNav relies on 3                         rd
                                                                                                              parties to supply data. If they were to stop supplying content to 
                                              TeleNav, its service offering would be impaired result                              ing in potential service disruption and even customer 
                                              contract cancellations. The content supply chain is fairly mature and each element of content has multiple 
                                              suppliers. As a cloud-based service, access to alternat                              ive suppliers could occur with relatively minor service 
                                              disruption (if any). However, a new contract with altern ative suppliers could be more  costly, impacting future 
                                              gross margins.    
                                              Carrier Dependence: TeleNav is dependent upon carrier partners to behave as anticipated in order to assure 
                                              future growth in revenue and earnings. If customers st                                  op reselling TeleNav solutions or they dramatically 
                                              change pricing, then future growth could be impair                                ed.  As well, TeleNav is dependent upon access to a 
                                              growing subscriber base controlled by carrier partners.                                If subscribers are lost, then TeleNavs future growth 
                                              may be impaired.  
                                              Global Economic Conditions:  Although mobile subscriptions have become a utility and are somewhat 
                                              immune to worldwide economic conditions, new market segments like automotive and advertising have proven 
                                              to be highly sensitive to worldwide market conditions. Short-term economic uncertainty caused by spikes in 
                                              commodity prices (such as oil) could trigger unfavorable economic conditions that could impair growth and 
                                              future cash flows.

                                         •   Paying subs increased to 19,600 from 17,700 last quarter, representing 54% y/y 
                                             and 11% q/q growth. Subs got a boost from T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular, as well as 
                                             international carriers. TNAV saw revenue growth at all key carriers in the quarter. 

                                         •   ARPU of $0.80 vs. $1.04 last year and $0.94 last quarter. The decline was 
                                             expected due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings and, to a greater 
                                             extent, the Sprint re-negotiation (full quarter impact). Management is not seeing a 
                                             noticeable impact from free navigation offerings, which originally hit the market in 
                                             October 2009. 

                                         •   Revenue from automotive, enterprise LBS, mobile advertising and ecommerce was 
                                             7% of total revenue in the quarter vs. 6% last quarter. TNAV expects revenue from 
                                             these segments to reach 10% of consolidated revenue by the end of F2011.

                                             750K local advertisers now versus 500K last quarter. 

                                         •   In January 2011, TNAV announced a two-year extension to the AT&T contract 
                                             with no changes to terms. The agreement now extends to March 2013. We believe 
                                             this announcement removes an overhang on the stock. 

                                         •   In January 2011, TNAV signed an agreement with Delphi to supply in-dash 
                                             navigation, using TNAV’s embedded software, to a global vehicle manufacturer. 

                                         •   Repurchased 328K shares in the quarter for $2.3M. This was part of the $20M

ESTIMATES 

Our FQ3/11 estimate ticks up on the heels of the strong FQ2/11 report. Our revenue 
estimate goes to $49M from $46M, sitting at the midpoint of guidance, while our EPS 
estimate of $0.16 (up from $0.12) is also at the mid-point of guidance. 

Our F2011 estimates were increased, as well, with our new revenue/EPS estimates of 
$198M/$0.81 falling in the middle of the guidance range. Our EPS estimate gets a bump up 
from both better revenue and gross margin assumptions. 

We are introducing our F2012 estimates, with revenue/EPS of $227M/$0.84 vs. consensus 
of $199M/$0.57. We are modeling slight margin compression from F2011E levels due to 
mix change in new strategic areas (auto, mobile advertising, etc.), as well as declining 
ARPU.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our $15.25 target implies 7x our new 2012 EV/EBITDA estimate, and 12.5x our new 2012 
adjusted EPS estimate plus cash. Our expanded EV/EBITDA multiple (previously 5x) is the 
result of the AT&T renewal, which we believe removes a risk overhang, overall 
outperformance across key metrics and an outlook for continued growth in all businesses. 
We maintain our BUY recommendation.

                                   •  Aside from extending the AT&T MR C contract for another two years , TNAV 
                                     outlined progress in the auto segment, su  bscriber growth at T-Mobile and US 
                                     Cellular, and metrics in ad-based revenues.  The company added 250,000 advertisers 
                                     for the ad-base navigation platform in just one quarter; click-through is over 3%, and 
                                     drive-to rates are still above 24%.  Manage ment expect these new growth initiatives 
                                     to generate more than 10% of revenues by FY12. 
                                   •  Raising estimates.   Sprint represented 44% of revenue in the quarter, implying 
                                     $21mm fixed fee per quarter, which will enable us to isolate growth at Sprint vs. 
                                     other carriers going forward, and project results with higher conviction. We are re-
                                     working our model and forecasting methodology and raising estimates. Our 
                                     subscription revenue forecast assumes that   Sprint fixed fee remains constant at 
                                     $21mm over the projection period. We then project other carrier subscription 
                                     revenue based on other MRC ARPU assumptions and subscriber growth 
                                     assumptions. Our forecasting methodology  and estimates for Auto, MRM and ad-
                                     based revenues remain unchanged. We are now modeling: FY11 PF EPS $0.86, 
                                     EBITDA $72.5mm, revenue $197.2 (previously $0.72 / $62.7mm / $187.1mm); 
                                     FY12 PF EPS $0.61, EBITDA $60.2mm, revenue $209.8mm (previously 
                                     $0.43/$45.9mm/$184.3mm); CY11 PF EPS $0.64, EBITDA $60.8mm, revenue 
                                     $199.4mm (previously $0.49/$47.4mm/$179.5mm); CY12 PF EPS $0.58, EBITDA 
                                     $58.1mm, revenue $222.1mm (previously $0.41/$44.2mm/$196.9mm). 
                                   •  Maintain Neutral,  meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                     undervalued, in our view, but we belie ve TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     improved metrics relating to the growth of premium and ad-based navigation 
                                     services, and better visibility into re-accel erating revenue and earnings growth.  Our 
                                     December 2011 price target goes to $9.50 (previously $7.50).

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                     undervalued, in our view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     improved metrics relating to the growth of premium and ad-based navigation 
                                     services, and better visibility into re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth. 

                                     Our December 2011 price target goes to $9.50 (previously $7.50) based on an 
                                     assigned multiple of 5x our upward revised CY12E PF EBITDA of $58.1mm.  Our 
                                     multiple is based on the comms software/services peer group current median multiple 
                                     of ~7x, but with a discount that takes into consideration significant shifts in the 
                                     competitive landscape (free navigation solutions, Android gaining market share in 
                                     handsets, TomTom gaining share in autos). 

                                     Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                             leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

    Highlights From the Conference Call

 Positive Notables
   TeleNav and AT&T extended their existing contract by 2 years. The contract was up for auto-renewal in March, and the extension
    provides TeleNav with access to AT&T's subscriber base on the same terms as before until 2013.
   Financial results were ahead of expectations; TeleNav beat our estimates and guidance for all key financial metrics.
   Subscriber results were also better than expected. TeleNav provided service to an average of 19.6M subscribers in the quarter, ahead
    of our 19.2M estimate. TeleNav exited the quarter providing service to more than 20 million subscribers.
   Management raised its outlook for fiscal 2011. The midpoint of 2011 revenue guidance was raised by 4.2% while the midpoint of
    net income guidance was raised over 19%. The company also raised gross margin guidance by 100 basis points. See Exhibits 2 and
    3, below, for a comparison of TeleNav's guidance to our estimates.
   TeleNav  signed  an  agreement  with  Delphi  to  bring  TeleNav's  navigation  software  to  select  models  from  a  global  vehicle
    manufacturer.
   TeleNav is growing its mobile advertising business. During the quarter, TeleNav increased its base of mobile advertisers by 50% to
    750,000. TeleNav's click-through rates remained high at 3.6% while drive to rates exceeded 24%.
   The  company  is  looking  to  grow  new  markets  and  technologies  through  M&A.  TeleNav  has  hired  a  new  VP  of  Corporate
    Development and Strategy who will lead TeleNav's strategic M&A efforts. On the call, management noted that they could use M&A
    both to extend their offerings internationally and also to add new technologies to the core product offerings.

 Negative Notables
   Operating  expenses  grew  meaningfully  this  quarter  and  are  expected  to  grow  again  in  fiscal  3Q11.  TeleNav  saw  growth  in
    compensation costs both from headcount increases and from greater competition for talent. R&D expenses grew as the company
    continues to explore new technologies and services.
   Despite management's assurances that TeleNav is not seeing a material impact from free navigation offerings, the competitive risks
    from these services remain.

 Net Net
 TeleNav's results were better than expected, the updated 2011 guidance should result in numbers moving up across the street, and the
 AT&T contract extension resolves one overhang. The longer-term risks of future carrier renegotiations and competition from other
 (free) navigation services remain, but we are getting increasingly confident that new revenue sources (advertising, automotive and
 enterprise LBS) can help to mitigate this risk. We are maintaining our Neutral rating, but we are increasing our target to $8 on better
 long-term revenue growth.

 Changes to Our Model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by 4%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising GAAP EPS
 to $0.80 from $0.69.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

 Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                    Painless So Far; Positive - ALERT 

                   • First Take: Positive                                                            Applied & Emerging Technologies

                   • TNAV beat F2Q expectations, reporting PF EPS of $0.24 on revenue of             Paul Coster, CFA
                                                                                                     (1-212) 622-6425 
                      $48 million (JPMe $0.17/$45.9mm, Street $0.17/46.2mm).  Average                paul.coster@jpmorgan.com 
                      subscribers came in at 19.6 million, ahead of our forecast (18.8mm).           J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
                      Gross margins at 82% easily beat our expectations of 79%, so the impact 
                      of the transition to Sprint fixed fee contract so far appears quite benign.  
                      Emerging product categories (premium navigation, auto, ad-based) 
                      represented 7% of revenues, ahead of our forecast of 5%.  The company 
                      benefited about $0.02 from a lowe     r-than-expected tax rate, but we 
                      believe the results were otherwise clean and encouraging. 

                   • F3Q and FY11 guidance, both ahead of expectations.  TNAV is looking 
                      for F3Q PF EPS of $0.16-$0.18 on sales of $48-50mm versus our at-
                      consensus forecast of $0.15 EPS on revenue of $45.2mm.  Gross margins 
                      are expected to be about 80% versus  our forecast of 76%.  For the full 
                      year, TNAV is looking for $0.84-$0.88 EPS on sales of $195-$200mm 
                      (JPMe $0.72/$187, Street $0.71/$190), so guidance has been increased 
                      by more than the extent of the F2Q beat. 

                   • The company has rolled over the AT&T contract by two additional years 
                      to March 2013, which removes a major overhang for at least another 
                      year.  TNAV has expanded its auto re lationships to include Delphi and 
                      QNX. 

                   • We should learn on the conference ca      ll what percentage of revenues 
                      originated from Sprint, at which point we should have a better handle on 
                      ARPU trends.  That said, the transition to a fixed fee contract with Sprint 
                      has impacted F2Q results much less than we anticipated.    

                   • TNAV conference call is at 5.00pm ET.  Dial-in: 888-208-1361.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

                               premium navigation, automotive  and enterprise LBS. This segment accounted for less than 
                               5% of revenues in the prior year and now accounts for 7% of revenues. 

                               The company increased its monthly paid subscri bers to 19.6 million, up  from 17.7 million in 
                               the prior quarter and 12.7 million in the prior year.  

                               Guidance 
                               The company guided earnings of $0.16 to $0. 18 per share for FYQ3, ahead of the street and 
                               our expectations of $0.16. The company also rev  ised its full year guidance upward, saying 
                               revenue would be between $195 and $200 million          and non-GAAP earnings would be 
                               between $0.84 and $0.88 per share. This is abov  e the street and our revenue estimate of 
                               $190 million. The EPS estimate is above the st  reet estimate of $0.56 and our estimate of 
                               $0.75.  

                               Financials 
                               The company generated $28.5 in cash from opera tions and increased thei r cash position to 
                               155.7 million. During the quarter the compan y repurchased 328,000 shares, bringing shares 
                               outstanding to between 45 and 46 million.   
                                
                               Conclusion 
                               Telenav continues to generate solid quarters . The company beat our estimates across most 
                               metrics. This was the first full quarter under   the new Sprint agreement. Under this, Sprint 
                               pays Telenav a fixed fee regardless of subscr iber adds. This has been a meaningful overhang 
                               on the stock and a factor which puts a dent in their revenue growth for the year. However, 
                               even on this front there were signs of positive trends. The company generated some revenue 
                               from premium subscriptions with Sprint subscri bers, this is still relatively small but bodes 
                               well for the companys long-term growth.  

                               The chief concern we have with Telenav, and a ke y issue we hear from investors, is the high 
                               level of customer concentration. Sprint cont ributed 45% of revenue and AT&T 40%, and as 
                               we saw two quarters ago large carrier customers  are not afraid to throw their weight around. 
                               We saw two encouraging signs on this front.   The first, the company announced they have 
                               renewed their AT&T contract for two years und er existing terms. We were concerned that 
                               AT&T would follow Sprints lead and seek better terms from Telenav. That has not come to 
                               pass. Secondly, revenue concentration has come down to 85% in Q2 from 87% in Q1 and 
                               >90% a year ago. The other legs of the companys business all advanced a bit, with 
                               international revenue now up 4%. The new carri er customers, T-Mobile US and US Cellular, 
                               now contribute 9% of revenue which is a stro ng showing for relationships less than a year 
                               old.  

                               Going forward we will be watching two factors.   First, can the company return to positive 
                               operating leverage? In a SaaS model, contribu tion margins from each  incremental customer 
                               should be highly positive. For Telenav, the new  Sprint model and ongoing R&D costs, mean 
                               that operating leverage is not apparent, an  d we still do not have the company growing

27 January 2011       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                             

                                earnings in FY12. However, there are some signs that by FY 13 (which we are not yet 
                                modeling) should see a return to earnings gr owth. The Sprint contract remains a sore spot, 
                                but we are comfortable with the companys R& D investments. A second focus will be the 
                                companys ability to diversify and grow revenue.  As noted above, there are early signs that 
                                this is proceeding slowly. The big question h ere will be can the companys ad platform gain 
                                traction. We had not expected any meaningful co ntribution from this until FY12, and see no 
                                change to that. However, location-based servic   es continues to be an important area of 
                                interest in the Web community. Telenav has some   very powerful data that with time they 
                                should be able to monetize. On the call, they     noted that they have one of the largest 
                                databases of real-time traffic nodes in the form of almost 20 million active users pinging their 
                                network. Many companies are searching for viable business models here and the success of 
                                local advertising websites such as Groupon point to the strong interest in successful 
                                platforms. It remains unclear whether Telenav can find a successful model in this domain, but 
                                they would hold significant value if and when they can unlock that model. 

                                We remain cautious pending further signs of resol ving this issue and thus reiterate our Hold 
                                rating. 

                                In line with the companys latest guidance, we are raising our estimates as follows: 
                                3Q11 was $46m and $0.16, is $49m and $0.17 
                                4Q11 was $45m and $0.13, is $49m and $0.17 
                                FY11 was $190m and $0.75, is $196m and $0.88 
                                FY12 was $193m and $0.65, is $207m and $0.81 
                                CY11 was $182m and $0.51, is $196m and $0.69 
                                 
                                Risks & Valuation 
                                We are raising our price target from $5 to $8 in  line with our revised estimates. Our valuation 
                                is based on a discounted cash flow analysis   using a 2% perpetual growth rate in line with 
                                long-term industry growth and a 15%discount rate  (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 
                                and risk premium of 7%).  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei     r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin    g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.      We would also see upside risk should the 
                                companys mobile ad platform take off sooner than expected.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

                                       • Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the mean of 
                                         our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still undervalued, in our 
                                         view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get better clarity on the business 
                                         model, improved metrics relating to the growth of premium and ad-based navigation

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                     undervalued, in our view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                     better clarity on the business model, improved metrics relating to the growth of 
                                     premium and ad-based navigation services, and better visibility into re-accelerating 
                                     revenue and earnings growth. 

                                     Our December 2011 price target of $7.50 is based on an assigned multiple of 5x 
                                     CY12E PF EBITDA of $47.4mn.  Our multiple is based on the communication 
                                     software/services peer group current median multiple of ~7x, but with a discount that 
                                     takes into consideration significant shifts in the competitive landscape (Android 
                                     gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining share in autos). 

                                     Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 
                                         •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                             leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate. 

                                                                                                                     3

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

Source: Bloomberg and J.P. Morgan; price data adjusted for stock splits and dividends.
Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

                                                          6 December 2010 

                                                                                
KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM MANAGEMENT MEETINGS  
We hosted management meetings in Boston on Friday and come away 
incrementally positive that core operating fundamentals are strong and that 
opportunities from mobile advertising and commerce exist going forward. Here 
are our key takeaways from the meetings: 

1.   Management remains upbeat and its message continues to be about growth 
   and new opportunities. Recall that today, TNAV has 14 carrier relationships 
   that include roughly one billion paying subscribers. TNAV’s total number of 
   subscribers is around 18M, signaling an underpenetrated market and the 
   opportunity for material upside. Additionally, the ramp in the company’s auto 
   opportunity is promising. Ford is ramping now under both the SYNC and My 
   Touch brands and there appears to be good opportunity for future deals here. 
   Medium term, the mobile advertising revenue stream potential, while small, 
   has very material upside, in our opinion. 

2.   AT&T contract risk appears to be misunderstood, in our opinion. Unlike the 
   recently renegotiated Sprint contract, which is a free bundle offering for all 
   data plan subscribers, AT&T (which will renew in March 2011), is a monthly 
   recurring charge (MRC) aligned as a profit center for AT&T and, in our 
   opinion, has much less risk. Management remains very upbeat about 
   prospects here. 

3.   Despite market fears from the cannibalization from Android (free Google turn-
   by-turn navigation), this is not supported by usage patterns seen at TNAV 
   with respect to subscriber growth and the overall market opportunity. In fact, 
   when TNAV's offering is pre-loaded side-by-side with Google Navigation on 
   the EVO 4G phone, TNAV’s take rates are unaffected relative to offerings 
   where Google’s free application is not offered. 

4.   Valuation is not consistent with the above outlook and opportunities, in our 
   opinion. The stock currently trades at 2.4x forward EV/EBITDA, which 
   implies a declining business and/or deteriorating outlook. However, we see 
   strength and growth, together with new opportunities. 

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 
Our $10 target price implies a 5x EV multiple on our 2011 EBITDA estimate of 
$61M and takes into account prepayment amounts received in October. We 
believe that core operating fundamentals are strong and continue to believe that 
opportunities from mobile advertising and commerce exist going forward. We 
maintain our BUY recommendation.   

 

 

                                                                                

                                                                               141

                      Management team expressed a high level of confidence in the firm's              paul.coster@jpmorgan.com 
                      long-term growth prospects.                                                     Marija Krgovic

                   • Management is confident that AT&T contract, due for renewal in                   marija.krgovic@jpmorgan.com 
                      March 2011, will roll over without major amendments.  There will be             Mark Strouse, CFA 
                      a 60 day period prior to renewal date  when amendments are possible, if         (1-212) 622-8244 
                      AT&T or TNAV request it. Management  views this as unlikely, due to             mark.w.strouse@jpmorgan.com 
                      the fact that MRC (monthly recurring charge) model at AT&T aligns               J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
                      with carrier and TNAV interests already. Under MRC model, user pays 
                      ~$10 monthly service charge, which is split between the carrier and 
                      TNAV. 

                   • In-dash navigation opportunity is global.  The company has achieved 
                      penetration into multiple Ford mode     ls globally; focus seems to be 
                      shifting to opportunity with other auto OEMs. TNAV has hired 
                      professionals with experience at major auto OEMs (e.g. Toyota, 
                      Mercedes, Delphi) to go after these opportunities.  

                   • MRM segment customer lineup seems impressive, and includes Xerox 
                      and Comcast. 

                   • Overall takeaway: mild positive.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

29 October 2010       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                              

                                Telenav reported 1QFY10 revenue of $51.1 million ahead of our estimate of $50.0 million and 
                                consensus of $48.6 million; pro-forma EPS of $0. 29 came in well ahead of our estimate of 
                                $0.20 and consensus of $0.22.  

                                Telenavs main customers, Sprint and AT&T , respectively represented 51% and 35% of the 
                                revenue. The new Sprint contract took affect  this quarter and will represent an amount less 
                                than the previous contract. Under this, Sprint pays Telenav a fixed sum regardless of 
                                subscriber count but the contract gives both pa rties incentives to add premium services. The 
                                AT&T contract is a revenue sharing agreement      and will be up for renegotiation in March  
                                2011. The company said, at this time, they meet  with AT&T regularly and do not expect the 
                                terms will change. 

                                In September the company updated its navigation -based mobile advertising platform and are 
                                starting to see some revenue growth in this     area. In addition, the company continues to 
                                leverage its core customer area to grow reven ue from premium navigation, automotive and 
                                enterprise LBS. However, these services still represent just over 5% of total revenues. 

                                Guidance 
                                The company guided earnings of $0.15 to   $0.17 per share for FYQ2, ahead of the street 
                                expectations of $0.13 and brackets our expectat ion of $0.17. The company also revised its 
                                full year guidance, saying revenue would be  between $187 and $192 mi llion and non-GAAP 
                                earnings would be between $0.70 and $0.78 per share. This is above the streets revenue 
                                estimate of $183 million and our estimate of   $185 million. The EPS estimate is above the 
                                street estimate of $0.62 and brackets our estimate of $0.76 per share.  

                                Financials 
                                The company experienced a drop of 14% in av erage revenue per customer (ARPU) to $0.94. 
                                However, they added 1.6 million subscribers and the total customer base now comes to 17.7 
                                million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by  $18.2 million, giving th e company a total of 
                                $131.1 million.  
                                 
                                Conclusion 
                                This is the kind of quarter the Telenavs business model should be able to deliver 
                                consistently. Unfortunately,   the changing nature of th      eir relationship makes such 
                                expectations unreliable. While the company did  a job of beating expectations, we have little 
                                confidence that they can keep up this pace inde finitely. Under their new  contract, Sprint will 
                                pay Telenav a fixed fee rather than on a per subs criber basis. Next quarter, with a full quarter 
                                of contribution, we should have a clearer picture of just how much Sprint is paying them. 
                                Regardless, we think some factors are already  clear. The average revenue Telenav generates 
                                is set to decline at a faster pace than we would have expected six months ago. ARPU is, of 
                                course, only part of the story, and total revenue  looks set to continue growing for the next 
                                several quarters.  

                                Beyond that, however, we enter somewhat un        charted territory. By the middle of FY12 
                                (2HCY11) the contribution from Sprint will li kely be a smaller share of Telenavs revenue. The 
                                difficulty will be determining what can take it  s place. While we are encouraged by the 
                                companys progress in rolling out its mobile ad pl atform, our sense is that this will still take 
                                many years before it can accelerate revenue       growth. In their late  st quarter, we saw 
                                encouraging signs in Telenavs numbers and in  managements commentary. Their mobile ad 
                                platform is growing. Hyper-local ads, location -based services, and mobile couponing are all 
                                very hot subjects in the Valley and venture ca pital communities. We are comfortable with the 
                                idea that there is a large opportunity here and  that Telenav has the potential to claim some of 
                                it. Unfortunately, the timing is opaque. We think it is likely that before this new leg of revenue 
                                growth can scale the traditional carrier busi  nesses will have slowed under new pricing 
                                regimes. This will make for several quarters of rocky transition.

                                So while we are encouraged by long-term tren ds, we remain cautious on our outlook for the 
                                next several quarters. We reiterate our Hold rating. 

                                We are lowering our estimates as below and are lowering our price target to reflect the latest 
                                guidance and increased risk profile of the company.

                                CY11 was $196m and $0.79, is $183 and $0.51 
                                 

                                Risks & Valuation 
                                We are lowering our price from $9 to $5. Our va luation is based on a discounted cash flow 
                                analysis using a 2% perpetual growth rate in    line with long-term industry growth and a 
                                15%discount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%).  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei     r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin    g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

                                    •  We still need more information.  The fixed fee associated with Sprint (51% of F1Q 
                                      revenue) will be more easily isolated in F2Q because the new contract will apply for 
                                      the entire quarter.  We shou  ld therefore be in a better position to determine the 
                                      ARPU trend associated with MRC (AT&  T was 36% of F1Q revenue), premium 
                                      services and other revenues.  It should also be possible to project gross margins with 
                                      a bit more certainty.  In short, it will take another quarter or two before sell-side 
                                      models stabilize, in our view. 
                                    •  Overall tone remains constructive.   Management believes that wireless operators 
                                      are committed to the TNAV white label service and exploring new revenue-sharing 
                                      ideas.  We note that operators can still place an own-brand navigation and search app 
                                      on the majority of smart phones and nearly   all feature phones,  so the threat from 
                                      Google, Nokia, TomTom and others is        still muted in that respect, though 'free 
                                      navigation' imposes price pressure on      TNAV.  The average subscriber count 
                                      increased to 17.7 million in F1Q11, so TNAV remains the dominant provider of LBS 
                                      navigation in N.America.

                                      undervalued, in our view, but we belie ve TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                      better clarity on the business model, improved metrics relating to the growth of

                                     Our December 2011 price target of $7.50 (previously $7.00) is based on an 
                                     unchanged assigned multiple of 5x CY12E PF EBITDA of $47.4 (previously 
                                     46.3mm). The change in the price target largely reflects the very significant increase 
                                     in the firms cash position, which went from $113mm in F4Q10 to $131mm in 
                                     F1Q11.  Our multiple assumption is based on the comms software/services peer 
                                     group current median multiple of ~7x, but with a discount that takes into

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen.

                                            •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                                 leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying

                                    •   Paying subs increased to 17,700 from 16,100 last quarter, representing 64% y/y and 
                                         10% q/q growth. This shows solid growth amid an environment of free turn-by-turn 
                                         competitor offerings. 

                                    •   ARPU of $0.94 vs. $1.10 last year and $1.03 last quarter. The decline was expected 
                                         due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings and, to a lesser extent, the 
                                         Sprint re-negotiation (the resolution came with roughly 9 days left in the September 
                                         quarter). 

                                    •   As a reminder, the term of the Sprint agreement was extended for one year with 
                                         TNAV’s preferred provider status now expiring two years later than originally 
                                         scheduled. TeleNav will receive a guaranteed annual fixed fee from Sprint for 
                                         navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles which will change from 
                                         year to year over the contract period. TeleNav will recognize revenue from the fees 
                                         monthly on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 

                                    •   The AT&T contract, which is a three-year agreement that automatically renews on an 
                                         annual basis, comes up for renewal in March 2011. Unlike the Sprint contract, this one 
                                         is a revenue share agreement (MRC). Management commentary is that it fully expects 
                                         the contract to renew. 

                                    •   TNAV saw revenue growth at all key carriers in the quarter. 

                                    •   Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter was $131M, up from $113M in FQ4/10. 
                                         Net cash per share increased to $2.92 from $2.69 last quarter.  

                                    •   FQ2/11 revenue/EPS guidance of $45M-$47M/$0.14-$0.16 vs. consensus of

ESTIMATES 

Our FQ2/11 estimate ticks up nicely on the heels of the strong FQ1/11 report. Our revenue 
estimate goes to $46M from $44M, sitting at the midpoint of guidance, while our EPS 
estimate of $0.16 (up from $0.11) is at the high-end of the guidance range. 

Our F2011 estimates were increased, as well, with our new revenue/EPS estimates of 
$190M/$0.67 falling in the middle of the guidance range.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our $10 target price implies a 5x multiple on our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $61M and 
takes into account prepayment amounts received in October. We believe that core 
operating fundamentals are strong and continue to believe that opportunities from mobile 
advertising and commerce exist going forward. We maintain our BUY recommendation.   

INVESTMENT RISKS 

Investment risks include, but are not limited to, customer concentration, competition, 
scalability, intellectual property and regulation.

 TeleNav Reports Solid FY1Q11 Results And Issues Better Guidance

 TeleNav reported fiscal 1Q11 results and hosted a conference call after the close on October 28. Financial results were in line to better
 than  expected,  although  subscriber  additions  were  less  than  our  forecast.  First  quarter revenues  were  1.2%  of  our  forecast,  while
 adjusted EBITDA was 19.3% ahead. GAAP EPS of $0.27 was 5c ahead of our estimate and street consensus of $0.22. Management
 raised fiscal 2011 guidance.

    Highlights From the Conference Call

 Positive Notables
   TeleNav  expects  the  AT&T  agreement  to  auto-renew  in  March  2011.  Management  declined  to  elaborate  on  what  gives  them
    confidence that it will be auto-renewed, but when pressed on the conference call, management noted that they are in constant dialog
    with all of their carrier partners. We believe TeleNav has probably been given a wink and a nod by AT&T that they don't plan on
    canceling or renegotiating the contract at this time.
   Financial results were ahead of expectations. TeleNav beat our estimates and guidance for all key financial metrics.
   Management raised its outlook for fiscal 2011. The midpoint of 2011 revenue guidance was raised by 3.8% while the midpoint of
    net income guidance was raised over 29%. The company also raised gross margin guidance by 200 basis points. See Exhibits 2 and
    3, below, for a comparison of TeleNav's guidance to our estimates.
   Management guided to meaningful growth in "other" revenues segment. In the current quarter, "other" revenues represented over 5%
    of  total  revenues,  but  is  expected  to  represent  10%  exiting  the  fiscal  year.  Other  revenues  are  driven  by  automotive,  premium
    navigation services, and mobile advertising.
   On the call, management noted that the company is earning premium service revenues from Sprint customers for services such as
    premium navigation (with voice input) and weather/traffic alerts.

 Negative Notables
   While an auto-renew of the AT&T contract would be a positive for the company, the terms of the contract call for the renewal
    period  to  only  last  for  one  year  (at  which  point  it  would  be  up  for  renewal  again).  This  essentially  means  that  there  are  no
    renegotiation overhangs in 2011, but in 2012 we could see an AT&T renegotiation followed by a Sprint renegotiation later in the
    year.
   TeleNav did not announce any new carrier or automotive partnerships.
   Subscriber additions were less than forecast. TeleNav added 1.6 million new subscription customers, versus our estimate of 2.0
    million. Customer adds were flat quarter-over-quarter.

 Net Net
 TeleNav's results were better than expected and the updated 2011 guidance should result in numbers moving up across the street.
 However,  the  longer-term  risks  of  future  carrier  renegotiations  and  competition  from  other  (free)  navigation  services  remain.  We
 maintain our $6 target and Neutral rating.

 Changes to Our Model
 We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue estimate by just over 5%, in line with management's updated guidance. We are also raising
 GAAP EPS to $0.69 from $0.53.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                                      •  We are lowering estimates with this note.   Specifically, we are cutting back the 
                                        auto-related royalties (e.g., Ford) by nearly 50% in calendar 2011; we think the 
                                        revenue ramp was too aggressive.  We have also cut back the ad-based revenue 
                                        ramp; this is an early-stage opportunity a nd we believe the bar should be set low.  
                                        We have also increased R&D slightly to re flect our view that th e firm must invest 
                                        heavily to capture new market opportunities.  CY11 EBITDA goes to $36 million 
                                        from $41 million, and CY12 EBITDA goes to $46 from $62 million. 
                                      •  Key questions for the call.   What percent of revenue will the Sprint flat fee 
                                        represent next quarter and beyond? Should the Sprint contract be considered as an 
                                        industry trend and will it affect TNAVs contracts with other carriers? What impact 
                                        is TeleNav seeing from free navigation solutions from Google and Nokia? How 
                                        are the Auto and TeleNav Track growth   initiatives proceeding, and what are the 
                                        latest expectations?  When can we e       xpect to see meanin  gful growth from 
                                        international markets, particularly at China Mobile? 
                                      •  Maintain Neutral,  meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                        mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                        undervalued, in our view, but we belie ve TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                        better clarity on the business model and its  drivers (particularly at Sprint). We are 
                                        incorporating a two-turn reduction in the EV/EBITDA multiple assumption for our 
                                        December 2011 price target, reflecting our   view of increased competition from 
                                        Android handsets and lower CY12 estimates.

                                    Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                    Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                    mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                    undervalued, in our view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                    better clarity on the business model and its drivers (particularly at Sprint).  

                                    Our December 2011 price target of $7.00 is based on an assigned multiple of 5x 
                                    CY12E PF EBITDA of $46.3mm, lowered from 7x. Our multiple assumption is 
                                    based on the comms software/services peer group current median multiple of ~7x, 
                                    but with a discount that takes into consideration recent significant shifts in the 
                                    competitive landscape (Android gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining 
                                    share in autos).   

                                    Although our estimates are lowered, our December 2011 price target remains 
                                    unchanged at $7.00. This is because we have corrected an error in our price target 
                                    calculation in which we failed to add back TNAVs net cash position of $113mm 
                                    into our market cap calculation.  With this adjustment and the decrease in our CY12 
                                    EBITDA estimate, our 2011 price target remains at $7. Based on the correct market 
                                    cap ($546mm), our price target in our September 21st TeleNav note would have been

                                    We could become more constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the 
                                    following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   Free navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                    We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                    reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.

                                            •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                            •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                            •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not materialize. 
                                            •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                                leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams

                            over the term of the agreement (28 months, starting September 1, 2010). As                             10
                            expected, the new contract leads to an  aggregate reduction in revenue from that

                            services will transition to TNAV brand over time, meaning that new subs and 
                            new devices will have a TNAV-branded navigation app instead of the Sprint-
                            branded one. While this may indicate that Sprints commitment to TNAV 
                            solution is moderating, it also yields TNAV the opportunity to establish its own 
                            brand in the marketplace and reach end-users directly.  

                         •  Contract with Tele Atlas was revised as well.   TNAV will pay fees related to 
                            Sprint's bundled navigation as a percentage of fees collected from Sprint for 
                            basic navigation services and from mobile advertising revenue, rather than the 
                            previous arrangement based on monthly fees per user or per transaction fees.

                                       slightly below expectations.  The company looks for F1Q11 PF EPS of $0.23 on 
                                       revenue of $50mm (JPM prior est $0.23/$51.4mm, Street $0.23/$50.3mm). FY11 
                                       PF EPS is expected to be in the range $0.55-$0.60 on revenue of $180-$185mm

                                       additional information to build precise  subscription (now subscription and fixed 
                                       fee) and advertising revenue forecasts.  For the time being, we have assumed 
                                       conservative FY11 and FY12 growth rates (6% and 3% respectively) on the 
                                       overall revenue, and aligned our PF EPS estimates with management guidance.

                                       MRM and Mobile Advertising segments,   we will provide a more detailed and 
                                       precise revenue model. We are now modeling FY11 PF EPS of $0.57 on revenue 
                                       of $182.2mm, PF EBITDA $48.4mm, FY12 PF EPS of $0.49 on revenue of

                                     associated with navigation and LBS solutions are now offset by the risks of pricing 
                                     pressure at key customers, spurred by the availability of 'free' solutions from Nokia 
                                     and Google. 

                                     December 31, 2011 price target is $7.00.  The Price Target is based on an assigned 
                                     multiple of 7 (previously 6 times) revised CY12E PF EBITDA of $61.9 million; the 
                                     multiple is based on the comms software/services peer group multiple. We have 
                                     increased the multiple by one turn to reflect the reduced risk profile for the stock. 
                                     The market cap takes into consideration $112mm in cash, and zero debt. We use 45.5

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   Negotations with Sprint conclude with more favorable pricing terms than 
                                             we have assumed. 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or negotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

SPRINT, TELEATLAS CONTRACTS AMENDED 

TeleNav finalized renegotiations with Sprint last night, and while price concessions were 
inevitable, the new contract terms provide upside opportunities from mobile advertising 
and commerce going forward, in our opinion. Additionally, we believe settlement of the 
renegotiation removes uncertainty around the name and puts a floor under the stock. 
Inevitably, the next question becomes “What about the upcoming contract expiration with 
AT&T?” but that contract employs a monthly recurring charge (MRC) model rather than 
the bundle model utilized by Sprint, so the Sprint renegotiation does not necessarily set a 
precedent for that contract going forward. Key points under the new contract are as 
follows: 

•   Term of the agreement extended to December 31, 2012 from December 31, 2011. 
    Sprint’s right to terminate without caused changed to June 30, 2012 from December 
    31, 2010. 

•   TeleNav will be Sprint’s preferred supplier of navigation through December 31, 2012 
    (previously December 31, 2010) and TeleNav branded navigation services will replace 
    the Sprint brand as part of the bundled offering. 

•   Bundle opportunities will be expanded to include Sprint’s prepaid subscriber base 
    (Boost and Virgin; approximately 10M subs). 

•   TeleNav will receive a guaranteed annual fixed fee from Sprint for navigation 
    applications provided to subscribers in bundles which will change from year to year 
    over the contract period. TeleNav will recognize revenue from the fees monthly on a 
    straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 

•   TeleNav’s portion of the revenue sharing arrangement for monthly recurring charge 
    navigation subscribers, enterprise LBS subscribers and revenue from mobile 
    commerce services was increased.  

•   TeleNav will pay TeleAtlas fees related to navigation services for Sprint’s bundles as a 
    percentage of fees collected from Sprint for basic navigation services and from mobile 
    advertising and mobile commerce revenue generated going forward versus the 
    previous monthly fee per user or per transaction. 

•   The term of the agreement remains unchanged and expires in July 2014. Financial 
    terms with respect to Sprint bundled offers will expire in concert with the expiration of 
    TeleNav’s agreement with Sprint for these services. 

•   Amendments to the Sprint and TeleAtlas agreements are retroactively effective as of 
    September 1, 2010 and August 1, 2010, respectively.  

ESTIMATES 

Management reiterated its previous FQ1/11 guidance and provided guidance for F2011. 
Management expects F2011 revenue/EPS of $180-$185M/$0.50-$0.55. Our new estimates 
are $182M/$0.55.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our new $8 target price implies a 5x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2011 EBITDA estimate of 
$53M.We believe that removing the uncertainty around the magnitude has created a floor 
for the stock and we see upside opportunities from mobile advertising and commerce going 
forward. We maintain our BUY recommendation.

 TeleNav Renegotiates Sprint Agreement

 TeleNav  agreed  to  a  new  a  contract  with  Sprint  that  will  provide  a  fixed  guaranteed  fee  to  TeleNav  for  bundled  subscribers  and
 potential  upside  from  unbundled  subs  and  additional  services.  While  the  deal  removes  a  major  near-term  overhang,  the  one-year
 extension means similar issues could arise in 12 - 18 months. Additionally, the company's contract with AT&T, which accounts for
 35% of TeleNav's revenues today expires in March 2011.

    Terms of the Agreement
 The contract is extended to YE2012 from YE2011, while Sprint's right to terminate the agreement is extended from YE2010 to June
 2012. TeleNav's preferred supplier status for navigation apps was broadened and extended through 2012 from YE2010. For TeleNav,
 the new contract terms allow the company's navigation services to be extended to a larger subscriber base, with the thought that the
 larger sub base can equate to higher value and additional LBS opportunities in the future. Sprint may now bundle TeleNav's navigation
 services  with  prepaid  plans,  and  because  Sprint  pays  a  guaranteed  fixed  fee  for  navigation  applications  provided  to  bundled
 subscribers, it is likely to make the service available to as many subscribers as the contractual limits provide. In addition, TeleNav can
 generate additional revenue (rev share) from unbundled subs, enterprise LBS customers, and by offering other services, such as mobile
 advertising, to a larger base of customers. The amendments are retroactive to September 1, 2010.

 Additionally, the company renegotiated its agreement with Tele Atlas, which provides map and Point Of Information (POI) services to
 TeleNav. The adjustments should reduce costs for TeleNav. According to the new terms, TeleNav will pay fees related to navigation
 services to Sprint's bundled customers as a percentage of fees collected from Sprint. Previously, fees to Tele Atlas were based on
 monthly fees per user or fees per transaction. The contract expires in July 2014, but terms related to Sprint's bundled offerings expire
 with the expiration of TeleNav's deal with Sprint. The amendments are retroactive to August 1, 2010.

    Guidance
 Management left fiscal 1Q11 guidance unchanged, despite the fact that the new Sprint agreement will go into effect retroactively to
 September 1. We think better than expected uptake of the service (especially at Sprint) in the first two months of the quarter, coupled
 with the cost declines associated with the Tele Atlas renegotiation, makes it possible for management to maintain 1Q guidance (see
 Exhibit 1 for details).

 However, management provided fiscal year 2011 guidance (see Exhibit 2) that was below our estimates (revenue guidance was about
 10% below our prior forecast). We had previously modeled a 20% decline in Sprint ARPU as a result of the renegotiation, but we had
 this decline occurring in fiscal 3Q11. While the pricing terms of the renegotiated deal were not made available, we believe the new
 contract works out to a price cut of just over 30% based on the our assumed, current Sprint subscriber count.

    Our Take On The News
 The new agreement with Sprint removes the single biggest investor concern; however, in doing so it raises some new questions. First,
 the agreement was only extended 1 year while Sprint's right to terminate was extended 18 months. This means that in 12-18 months,
 revenues from Sprint could be in question again. Second, while TeleNav will straight-line the revenues earned from Sprint over the
 contract period, we do not know for sure if the cash revenues are increasing or decreasing over time and at what rate. Because of this,
 it is difficult to know how Sprint will value the agreement at the end of the contract. Finally, despite Sprint remaining a preferred
 provider, the competitive risks remain as larger players with deep pockets continue to express interest in mobile LBS services. We do
 think that management is making the right moves to remain a big player in mobile LBS, however. Building a large subscriber base and
 making its brand name known can go a long way to helping it secure mobile advertising contracts and making its portal a go-to place
 for mobile search.

    Updates To Our Model
 We are lowering our estimates in conjunction with the newly provided fiscal 2011 guidance. We are reducing our fiscal 2011 revenue
 estimate by just over 10%, and lowering GAAP EPS to $0.53 from $0.88. Our target price remains $6, but is no longer based on a
 probability weighted set of scenarios for the Sprint renegotiation outcome. Instead, it is based on a discounted cash flow analysis
 through 2015 - consistent with the way we analyze other companies in our coverage universe (see page 8 for details). Our assumptions
 include  a  cost  of  capital  of  16.0%  and  a  3.0%  terminal  growth  rate.  Note  that  our  prior  DCF  analysis  of  our  base  case  (see  our
 initiation report dated September 10 for details) yielded a per share value of $7 prior to adjusting for various Sprint scenarios. We
 continue to rate TeleNav Neutral.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                                                                                                       September 10, 2010  
                                    

                                   Investment Summary            

                                   TeleNav is a well-established provider of navigation and Location-Based Services (LBS), a 
                                   growing, but increasingly competitive space.  TeleNav currently has a high revenue growth 
                                   rate (FY 2010 revenues grew by 54%), but there is risk to future growth, ARPU and the 
                                   sustainability  of  the  current  customer  count  due  to  TeleNav’s  customer  concentration.  
                                   90% of revenues are derived from Sprint and AT&T customers, with 55% of its revenues 
                                   coming  from  Sprint  customers  and  the  Sprint  contract  currently  in  renegotiations  (the 
                                   contract with AT&T could end in 2011).  While we foresee a sizeable market opportunity 
                                   in the LBS space, a number of large competitors with deep pockets (namely Google and 
                                   Apple) have the ability to offer LBS services for free in order to build a customer base.  
                                   Google has already offered free turn-by-turn navigation on certain Android smartphones 
                                   and Apple is leading the industry in integrated mobile advertising.  The proliferation of the 
                                   leading smartphone operating systems has simplified the process for writing software for 
                                   multiple vendors, and, in our opinion, lowered the barrier to entry for getting new location-
                                   based applications onto devices. 

                                   We rate TeleNav Neutral primarily due to the risks associated with the Sprint contract 
                                   renewal and the competitive threats faced by the company.  Our $6 price target is based on 
                                   a scenario analysis of different Sprint contract outcomes.  If the company were to resolve 
                                   the  renegotiation  overhang  in  a  favorable  manner,  we  think  the  stock  would  react  in 
                                   positive manner.  We would also use that opportunity to re-evaluate our rating. 

                                   TeleNav is a leading provider of Location Based Services for mobile applications.  The 
                                   company’s  flagship  product  is  handset-based  turn-by-turn  mobile  navigation  services, 
                                   although    TeleNav    also    provides    vehicle-based    navigation    services,    location-based 
                                   advertising  services  and  enterprise  mobile  resource  management  services.    TeleNav’s 
                                   navigation services are offered primarily through wireless carriers as a white label service 
                                   and  revenues  are  generated  on  a  monthly  subscription  fee  basis.    As  of  June  30,  2010, 
                                   TeleNav had 16.1 million customers subscribed to its service.  The base case used in our 
                                   valuation is rooted in a discounted cash flow analysis using a cost of capital of 16.0%, and 
                                   a  terminal  growth  rate  of  3.0%.      On  an  EV/EBITDA  basis,  our  target  price  implies 
                                   multiples  of  3.2  times  estimated  CY2010  EBITDA  and  3.5  times  estimated  CY2011 
                                   EBITDA. 

                                    

                                   Investment Thesis and Valuation 

                                   TeleNav is a market leader in wireless Location Based Services (“LBS”); a market we 
                                   believe is in the early stages of a multi-year growth cycle.  As more and more customers 
                                   adopt smartphones, the usage of LBS applications like navigation is likely to increase.  
                                   Despite our outlook for strong industry growth, TeleNav faces real challenges in its 
                                   renegotiations with Sprint and from external competition.  Our Neutral rating is based on 
                                   our view that the potential for long-term stock appreciation is overshadowed by these near-
                                   term risks.  In our base case earnings model, we assume that the Sprint contract is extended, 
                                   but with a 20% reduction in ARPU.  Using this assumption, our earnings model yields a 
                                   discounted cash flow valuation of $7.  We believe this is the most likely outcome with a 
                                   60% likelihood.  However, in our target price calculation, we account for the possibilities

                                   for 55% of TeleNav’s revenues, and that a contract extension is likely to result in a decrease 
                                   in ARPU and total revenues. The contract was scheduled to expire at the end of 2011, with 
                                   TeleNav exclusivity scheduled to end December 31, 2010.   

                                   Sprint is a very important customer of TeleNav.  Not only does it account for 55% of 
                                   TeleNav’s revenues, but it is responsible for an even higher percentage of TeleNav’s 
                                   subscriber count.  This is because Sprint, unlike AT&T (who accounts for 35% of 
                                   revenues), bundles the TeleNav navigation service in its all-inclusive data plans and 
                                   TeleNav generates a lower ARPU per bundled customer than it does for a customer who 
                                   subscribes to the service directly.  As location based services (LBS) grows as an industry, we 
                                   believe capturing a high user count will be an important component of survival and 
                                   prosperity.  To this end, we believe TeleNav will want to keep its service bundled for Sprint 
                                   users. 

                                   So what are the possible outcomes?  TeleNav would most likely want to extend the contract 
                                   with roughly the same framework.  But, in order to win an extension of its exclusive 
                                   contract, TeleNav is likely going to have to concede on price.  Sprint customer ARPU is 
                                   already below the average due to bundling, and we question how much lower TeleNav 
                                   would be willing to go on price.  ARPU at the end of fiscal 4Q10 was $1.03, down from 
                                   $1.18 reported one year earlier.   

                                   The worst outcome would be if Sprint decided it was going to unbundle navigation from its 
                                   plans and/or drop TeleNav as a provider.  While this would be disastrous, we think it is 
                                   unlikely given that the last thing Sprint would want to do is to tick off its subscribers by 
                                   either telling them navigation is no longer available or asking them to now pay for it 
                                   separately (amounting to a service plan price increase).  Another outcome is that Sprint 
                                   could decide to no longer bundle the service in new service plans (keeping the service free 
                                   for existing service pan contracts), which would lower TeleNav’s growth rate, but not put a 
                                   large amount of existing revenues at risk.  Yet another scenario is that Sprint could decide 
                                   to add another navigation provider either as a co-supplier of the service with TeleNav or as 
                                   a new sole supplier.  Both of these scenarios could also put a large percentage of revenues at 
                                   risk. 

                                   While it is nearly impossible to predict the outcome of the negotiations, we have 
                                   incorporated the most probable scenarios into our earnings model and valuation, as we 
                                   mentioned earlier.  Exhibit 2, below, illustrates the four scenarios we use in our model and 
                                   the probabilities we have assigned to each.  Keep in mind, however, that even when the 
                                   Sprint contract overhang is settled, TeleNav will still need to address its agreement with 
                                   AT&T that expires in March 2011.  Recall that AT&T customers represent 35% of 
                                   revenues. 

                                   Our earnings model is based on our base case, to which we assign a 60% probability and 
                                   which assumes a 20% price cut for Sprint in fiscal 3Q11 and a corresponding 20% price cut 
                                   at AT&T in fiscal 2Q12.  The model is highly sensitive to changes in this outcome, 
                                   however.  If the price cut was 30% instead of 20%, our fiscal 2012 EBITDA would be 
                                   reduced by 30% and EPS would be reduced by 45% (both assuming constant costs).  Our 
                                   discounted cash flow model would yield a per share equity value of $5 in this scenario.  
                                   Alternatively, 10% price cut (versus our assumed 20%) would result in a nearly 30% 
                                   increase in fiscal 2012 EBITDA and a DCF valuation of more than $9.

                                      Is TeleNav A Takeout Candidate? 

                                      Possibly.  TeleNav has a desirable set of technologies and a growing user base, which could 
                                      be useful to a larger internet or mobile service provider looking to get into mobile location-
                                      based services.  However, the fact that TeleNav is often sold as a white-label service 
                                      diminishes this possibility.  If another company wanted simply to grow its user base of 
                                      navigation services (potentially to market and sell LBS advertising services), it would not 
                                      need to purchase TeleNav outright.  Instead, this other company could offer navigation 
                                      services to Sprint and/or AT&T at better terms, replacing TeleNav as the provider and 
                                      getting access to subscribers that account for up to 90% of TeleNav’s revenues today.  

                                                        

                                      Investment Risks 

                                      Customer concentration.   TeleNav supplies its LBS offerings primarily through wireless 
                                      carriers.  With the U.S. currently being the leading market for LBS services, TeleNav 
                                      generates the majority of its revenue through its largest two carrier customers.  As such, 
                                      Sprint currently represents 55% of sales in while AT&T represents 35% of sales.  As we 
                                      outlined above, the Sprint contract is currently being negotiated and the company has 
                                      warned that the outcome could likely result in a reduction in ARPU.   The AT&T contract 
                                      expires in March 2011.   

                                      Larger Competitors Could Offer LBS for Free:    While TeleNav’s service offering is tough 
                                      to duplicate and its integration with carrier partners create high switching costs, the mobile 
                                      navigation market is in the early stages of growth and competing technologies could drive 
                                      down prices or change market dynamics.  Currently, TeleNav works with all major 
                                      smartphone Operating Systems (“OS’s”).  However, Google’s Android OS is gaining 
                                      market share of devices sold and Google has expanded its map capabilities and currently 
                                      offers free navigation services.

                                                                                                        September 10, 2010  
                                    

                                   Google has created a map service and now offers free guided, turn by turn navigation as 
                                   part of its Google Maps product for Android smartphones.  With its purchase of 
                                   NAVTEQ, Nokia now has a leading global map database and offers navigation and 
                                   mapping services to owners of Nokia smartphones for free.  Microsoft’s new Windows 7 
                                   OS will also offer free navigation service.  While Windows has limited market share to date, 
                                   it is another large company competing with TeleNav.  If Nokia, Microsoft, and Google 
                                   penetrate wireless carriers with free mobile navigation service, then TeleNav’s sales growth 
                                   could be at risk.  

                                   Inability To Win New Carrier Partners.   While long-term TeleNav can grow revenues 
                                   through its enterprise, automotive and advertising/search businesses, we believe near-term 
                                   growth will be driven by the core mobile navigation product.  Any inability for TeleNav to 
                                   continue to grow its carrier partners could negatively impact revenue growth rates. 

                                   Pricing Risk.   Given the current negotiation of the Sprint contract, the upcoming expiration 
                                   of the AT&T contract and the fact that Google is beginning to offer mobile navigation for 
                                   free, the carriers and consumers have considerable power to demand lower pricing for 
                                   navigation services.  In addition, if the carriers were to increase the pricing of TeleNav’s 
                                   services to end users, TeleNav could lose customers. 

                                   Bundling.   TeleNav benefited from Sprint’s decision to bundle navigation services into the 
                                   Any Mobile and Simply Everything plans.  A decision to unbundle the product could result 
                                   in a material decline in the number of customers subscribing to TeleNav’s services. 

                                   Competition for New LBS Services.   TeleNav strives to expand into leading edge LBS 
                                   services like paid mobile search and advertising.  While TeleNav’s carrier relationships are 
                                   strong assets, we know that Apple and Google are also interested in mobile LBS advertising 
                                   and could be overwhelming competitors. 

                                   Litigation Risk.   In recent weeks, multiple law firms have announced class action lawsuits 
                                   against TeleNav alleging false and misleading statements in its registration statement.  
                                   Because TeleNav announced the renegotiation of the Sprint contract within months of 
                                   closing its IPO, we believe some investors will question when management knew of this 
                                   development.  As such, there is likely to be some headline litigation risk for the foreseeable 
                                   future.  

                                   Intellectual Property.   TeleNav has been granted 19 patents with 50 pending to date, but 
                                   numerous other companies also claim rights to different navigation and LBS technologies.  
                                   TeleNav has limited outstanding lawsuits to date, although its carrier customers offering its 
                                   service have been sued and TeleNav offers its carriers indemnification provisions.  Due to 
                                   these and any potential future lawsuits, TeleNav could face mounting legal expenses.   

                                   Map Data.   The largest component to TeleNav’s cost of revenues is the fees paid for map 
                                   and Point Of Information (POI) data.  TeleNav dual-sources this data from both Tele Atlas 
                                   and NAVTEQ in order to keep pricing in check, but future price increases could negatively 
                                   impact margins.  

                                   Lock-up Expiration.   On November 10, 2010, the 180-day lock up period post TeleNav’s 
                                   initial public offering will expire, giving many shareholders the opportunity to sell their 
                                   TeleNav stock.  At the time of the IPO, owners of nearly 35 million shares were restricted

                                   overhang on the stock due to additional selling pressure, we think the near-term effects will 
                                   be minimal given the recent decline in share price. 

                                                                                                    

                                   LBS Industry Overview 

                                   Mobile location based services (LBS) is essentially the use of embedded GPS technology to 
                                   provide location-specific information and services.  Mobile navigation is the most obvious 
                                   application of LBS, but advertising, social networking, and many other services are likely to 
                                   use the technology as well. As smartphone penetration and the use of mobile applications 
                                   continue to grow, we expect the mobile LBS market to enter a phase of strong growth over 
                                   the next few years.  As LBS navigation services ramp in sales over the next several years, we 
                                   expect it to cannibalize a portion of the $12B PND (Personal/Portable Navigation Device) 
                                   market.    

                                   Sizing The Market Opportunity 

                                   While the LBS market is still nascent, we believe the rapid adoption of smartphones taking 
                                   place today, along with the explosion in mobile application development and usage will 
                                   result in accelerating consumer adoption and revenue generation for LBS services over the 
                                   next several years.  Nearly every smartphone sold today includes GPS capabilities and the 
                                   carriers are continually looking for ways to monetize their investment in next generation 
                                   data networks.  Research firm Gartner has predicted that the global location based services 
                                   market will grow from just over $2 billion in 2009 and 2010 to more than $8 billion in 2014.  
                                   In its forecast, Gartner assumes that personal navigation, which made up 75% of all 
                                   location-based revenues in 2009 will account for approximately 40% of all location-based 
                                   revenues in 2014.  Services such as location-based search and social networking applications 
                                   are predicted to be responsible for much of the growth.  Separately, eMarketer estimated in 
                                   a 2009 report that U.S. mobile advertising will grow to $1.6 billion on 2013 from a mere 
                                   $320 million in 2008.  

                                   Not only will the applications that derive the revenues shift over time, but the expected 
                                   payers of the revenue are expected to shift from the consumer end-user to advertisers.  We 
                                   believe that over the next 5 years, advertising-derived LBS revenues could account for at 
                                   least 70% of U.S.  LBS revenues (see Exhibit 3).

                                   Company Overview 

                                   TeleNav is a leading provider of Location Based Services for mobile applications.  The 
                                   company’s flagship product is handset-based turn-by-turn mobile navigation services, 
                                   although TeleNav also provides vehicle-based navigation services, location-based 
                                   advertising services and enterprise mobile resource management services.  TeleNav’s 
                                   navigation services are offered primarily through wireless carriers as a white label service 
                                   and revenues are generated on a monthly subscription fee basis.  As of June 30, 2010, 
                                   TeleNav had 16.1 million customers subscribed to its service.  

                                    

                                   Product Offerings 

                                   GPS Navigator – TeleNav’s flagship product offering is its GPS Navigator service, which is 
                                   predominantly accessed today through various mobile handsets, but is also available via in-
                                   dash automotive solutions and TeleNav’s own portable navigation device (not unlike a 
                                   Garmin or Tom Tom device available at retailers today).  The GPS Navigator product 
                                   provides voice-guided, turn-by-turn navigation with a feature set that includes  3-D moving 
                                   maps, automatic re-routing for missed turns; over 13 million points of interest (POI), real-
                                   time traffic, gas prices, and the ability to pre-plan trips via the TeleNav website.   

                                   TeleNav’s navigation service is differentiated from traditional navigation products by its 
                                   subscription model (more on this below), but also through its server-based architecture (see 
                                   Exhibit 4).  By obtaining map, route and POI data directly from TeleNav in real-time, users 
                                   are assured of having the latest available information without the need to update or replace 
                                   their device, often a costly proposition.

                                  TeleNav’s GPS Navigator is available through 15 wireless carriers in approximately 29 
                                  countries today.  However, the majority of revenues are derived from AT&T and Sprint, 
                                  where TeleNav offers its GPS Navigator product as a white label service. GPS Navigator is 
                                  available on all major mobile operating systems, including the popular iOS and Android 
                                  operating systems.  Over 500 handsets are TeleNav capable today, and carriers often pre-
                                  load the software onto the handset.  Mobile Navigation accounted for 94% of FY2010 
                                  revenues (91% derived from US operations, 3% derived internationally). 

                                  Automotive – More recently, TeleNav has been working to bring its navigation services to 
                                  the in-dash automotive market.  The company’s first in-dash product was available on 2010 
                                  Ford Focus and Taurus models.  The product was predominantly voice driven and required 
                                  a cellular voice connection to transmit navigation data.  There was not a large LCD screen 
                                  showing a visual map, and the navigation directions were all orally given over the car’s 
                                  speaker system.  Nevertheless, this Ford SYNC solution had a much lower cost than 
                                  traditional in-car navigation systems and thus had a broader consumer reach. 

                                  For the next version of TeleNav’s in-dash product, we expect the company to marry its 
                                  navigation services with an in-dash screen.  Connected with TeleNav’s servers, the device 
                                  will be able to provide real-time traffic, gas prices and frequently updated maps.  TeleNav 
                                  expects this service to be available in the U.S. on certain 2011 model cars (definitely with 
                                  Ford and discussions are ongoing with other manufacturers).   

                                  Stagnation of traditional in-dash navigation and falling prices in portable navigation 
                                  devices has created an opening for TeleNav to enter the in-dash market.  Auto

                                   manufactures have liked selling navigation with new vehicles because it helps them to 
                                   generate more profit.  However, the in-dash manufacturers have kept prices high at the 
                                   same time that portable devices have gotten cheaper than ever, resulting in increased 
                                   adoption of portable devices at the expense of in-dash navigation.  TeleNav presents a 
                                   unique solution to this problem for car manufacturers.  TeleNav licenses its technology to 
                                   the manufacturer for about $100 per device, and the total installed cost is much cheaper 
                                   than a typically in-dash system today.  Not only is it cheaper, but the TeleNav system also 
                                   provides more functionality including real-time information and automatically-updated 
                                   maps. 

                                   Mobile Resource Management – TeleNav offers enterprises a suite of services to help them 
                                   manage mobile workforces and vehicle fleets.  Services include TeleNav Track, TeleNav 
                                   Vehicle Manager, TeleNav Vehicle Tracker and TeleNav Asset Tracker.  These solutions 
                                   allow enterprises to better manage their workforces by integrating enterprise back-office 
                                   systems with turn-by-turn directions to help workers get to their destinations, real-time and 
                                   historical reports of locations and travel times, updated job status information, automatic 
                                   alerts when a worker of vehicles enters or leaves a location, and customizable wireless 
                                   forms to capture field information.  TeleNav is a top-two leader in the enterprise mobile 
                                   resource management space. 

                                   Location-Based Advertising – While not a meaningful part of TeleNav today, location-
                                   based advertising services has the potential to become a big revenue driver in the future.  
                                   Beginning in late 2009, TeleNav deployed mobile-based advertising solutions to a limited 
                                   number of end users; features included location specific sponsored listings, content, 
                                   coupons and dining menus.  Future possibilities include the potential for TeleNav to get 
                                   paid for navigating customers to certain locations after they perform a search. 

                                    

                                   Billing Models                

                                   TeleNav’s core GPS Navigator revenues are subscription based, either billed to end-users as 
                                   a standalone product or as part of a bundle of services offered by wireless carriers.  
                                   Customers on the subscription-based model will choose to have navigation services on their 
                                   device for a monthly fee typically ranging from $7-10.  Often, the carrier (in conjunction 
                                   with TeleNav) will offer a free month of service to entice the user to sign up longer-term.  
                                   In addition, the TeleNav application is also usually pre-loaded onto the devices – again to 
                                   help spur adoption.  AT&T customers are subscription-based. 

                                   For the bundled model, carriers will include navigation as part of a service plan – customers 
                                   do not have to opt-in and they are not explicitly charged for the service.  Sprint currently 
                                   bundles TeleNav’s navigation in its all-inclusive data plans (Simply Everything and Any 
                                   Mobile plans).  Bundling gives TeleNav a much broader customer set, but TeleNav 
                                   commands a much lower ARPU for a bundled customer compared to that of a stand-alone 
                                   customer. 

                                   In either case, customers are billed by the wireless carriers and the revenues (less some 
                                   margin to the carriers) are passed on to TeleNav.  We believe this arrangement is a strength 
                                   of TeleNav’s business model.  Customers do not have to set up and pay a separate bill, 
                                   TeleNav does not have to develop its own billing system or take on separate credit risk, and

                                   the carriers get a piece of the action.  This relationship with the carriers could act as a 
                                   barrier for competitors looking to get into TeleNav’s newest offerings, such as location-
                                   based advertising. 

                                    

                                   Competitors 

                                   Up until a year ago, when the Motorola Droid was released, TeleNav faced very real, but 
                                   manageable competition.  TeleNav’s GPS Navigator was a lower cost option than 
                                   traditional in-vehicle navigation and could be used across multiple vehicles.  Compared to 
                                   portable navigation devices (PNDs), TeleNav may have been cheaper (depending upon the 
                                   assumed lifespan of the PND), but it was certainly more portable, always had up-to-date 
                                   maps, and could incorporate real-time data.   

                                   With the Droid, however, Google introduced its own, free turn-by-turn navigation 
                                   software.  Today, Google Navigation is only available on a subset of Android-based 
                                   devices, which themselves represent a subset of handsets that can access TeleNav’s GPS 
                                   Navigator application.  We can objectively say that TeleNav’s offering is better than that of 
                                   Google today, but it’s hard to compete with a free product and Google could easily use its 
                                   warchest to improve its offering.  Google could also roll out the product to all Android 
                                   devices and could ultimately make it available to other devices, like the Apple iPhone.  
                                   While TeleNav’s service is superior today, we think Google navigation could be a 
                                   meaningful threat in the future, especially if it remains free. 

                                   TeleNav faces competition in the navigation space from established PND manufacturers 
                                   like Garmin and TomTom, other mobile navigation providers like Network In Motion, and 
                                   from Nokia, who bundles its own navigation product with its phone.  It is certainly a 
                                   diverse competitive environment, but there is plenty of opportunity for TeleNav to increase 
                                   its share.  TeleNav currently provides service to less than 7% of total US wireless customers 
                                   and to a much smaller percentage of global wireless customers.

                                   TeleNav also stands to face stiff competition in its emerging business lines, namely 
                                   location-based advertising.  Once again, Google is likely to become a big player in this 
                                   space, given their footholds in the mapping, internet search, and now the mobile OS arenas.  
                                   Apple is a competitor too with its recently debuted iAds platform for placement of 
                                   advertisements in mobile applications.  While the emergence of competitive location-based 
                                   advertising services from Google and Apple could actually help raise awareness with 
                                   potential advertisers and improve the economics for TeleNav, we still view Google and 
                                   Apple as large risks.  We believe TeleNav’s ultimate success in mobile advertising will 
                                   depend on two factors: TeleNav’s ability to obtain a large user base for its navigation 
                                   services and the company’s continued revenue-sharing relationships with the wireless 
                                   carriers.  As long as TeleNav has a meaningful base of customers using its mobile 
                                   navigation services, it should be able to monetize those users’ searches.  In addition, the 
                                   company’s historical revenue sharing agreements with the carriers could help TeleNav 
                                   achieve some sort of preferential treatment on end-users devices. 

                                   In the in-dash, automotive market, TeleNav is the new entrant and thus doesn’t face large 
                                   competitive threats that put revenues at risk.  TeleNav has a superior, lower-cost product 
                                   that should be able to generate added value.  In its mobile resource management business 
                                   line, TeleNav faces day-to-day competition in winning new contracts, namely from 
                                   industry leader Xora, but nothing that is incrementally disruptive to the business model.

                                  TeleNav as a Brand? 

                                  TeleNav’s flagship GPS Navigator product is primarily sold as a white-label product to the 
                                  majority of customers.  That is, customers are buying “Sprint Navigation” or “AT&T 
                                  Navigator” and not “TeleNav.”  This has been an acceptable arrangement for TeleNav, as 
                                  getting its service sold to these customers has helped the company expand its users base.  
                                  Looking ahead, though, we believe a branded product could be beneficial as TeleNav looks 
                                  to capitalize on other location-based services like advertising.  Building a strong brand 
                                  could help TeleNav become a go-to portal for location searching, which again would help 
                                  build advertising revenues.  We would not be surprised to see TeleNav pursue a branded 
                                  product strategy as it re-negotiates with its carrier partners.  

                                   

                                  Geographic Presence 

                                  North America.   TeleNav has a strong presence in the North America market with 3 of the 
                                  4 major carriers selecting TeleNav for its service offering.  With AT&T, Sprint, and T-
                                  Mobile choosing TeleNav, we believe TeleNav has strong growth opportunities with these 
                                  three carriers, given TeleNav has 16M subscribers and these 3 carriers have nearly 160M 
                                  subscribers.  Network in Motion is TeleNav’s primary competitor in North America 
                                  through its service offering for Verizon’s mobile navigation service.  AT&T offers 
                                  competing mobile navigation services along with TeleNav, but TeleNav is the AT&T 
                                  branded service.  TomTom, Garmin, and others offer mobile navigation applications on 
                                  AT&T’s iPhone, but even on the iPhone the TeleNav service is the most used.   

                                  Europe and Asia.   Europe and Asia represent growth opportunities for TeleNav, evidenced 
                                  by the fact that 30% of the company’s resources are focused on international operations 
                                  despite generating only 4% of revenues.  Europe is still in the early stages of offering mobile 
                                  phone navigation services, creating a potential opportunity for TeleNav; today, Telmap of 
                                  Israel is the early market leader.  Vodafone was in the process of building its own service 
                                  offering following its acquisition of Wayfinder in December 2008 for roughly $33M. 
                                  However, Vodafone announced it is closing down Wayfinder in March 2010 as it believes it 
                                  is no longer viable for Vodafone to continue to develop and operate its own navigation 
                                  products. As such, Vodafone has indicated it will partner with other companies such as 
                                  Nokia and Google to offer navigation and location based services.  

                                  Asia is also in the early stages of offering mobile navigation services, but we believe this is a 
                                  potentially large market opportunity given the demographics and large installed base of 
                                  mobile phones.  TeleNav could be well-positioned in the Asia market, as it counts China 
                                  Mobile, the world’s largest wireless operator, as its customer.

                                  TeleNav reported its first quarterly results (fiscal 4Q10) since its initial public offering on 
                                  July 29, 2010.  Fourth quarter revenues grew 45% to $49.5M compared to the previous 
                                  year, while net income grew 3% year-over-year.  The average number of paying monthly 
                                  customers grew 69% to 16.1 million.  Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) declined 13%

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at

     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.

                            contract negotiations with Sprint have   intensified ahead of the December 31                            May-10

                            prospects seriously at risk and could lead other customers to pressure pricing.  

                         •  Sprints BATNA:  Free Navigation. On discussing the issue with TNAV 
                            management, we believe Sprint is seeking an aggressive reduction in pricing, 
                            possibly citing ad-based 'free' navigation as the best alternative to a negotiated 
                            agreement (BATNA). We believe TNAV is  countering with proposals for price 
                            reductions and new applications; however we sense that Sprint has the upper 
                            hand. Critically, this is not a replay of  the last contract ro llover, where bundled 
                            pricing sparked a net revenue gain for TNAV owing to price-elastic demand; 
                            this time Sprint seeks a net reduction in cost of supply, we believe.

                                     •  We are cutting estimates.  We are introducing a 37% reduction in ARPU to $0.64 
                                       by mid CY11, which assumes price declines  of near 50% at Sprint, flat at AT&T, 
                                       T-Mobile, and other carriers. We also assume subscriber growth is 10% lower than 
                                       our prior forecast on the assumption that Sprint pushes a higher proportion of 
                                       customers into ad-based services. We ar  e reducing gross margins by ~190bp in 
                                       FY11 and by 280bp in FY12. We assume th at company reins in operating expenses 
                                       relative to prior expectations but continues to ramp R&D investment. Where 
                                       previously we forecast a 22% CY10-1  2 revenue CAGR, we now forecast 5%. 
                                       CY11E EBITDA goes to $43.2mm (previously $78.8mm), and CY12 goes to 
                                       $71.2mm (previously $97.4mm). Until we know the outcome of the Sprint 
                                       negotiations, we sense there is downside risk to these estimates.  
                                     •  We believe contract negotiations with  Sprint will conclude by December 31, 
                                       2010.  
                                     •  We are downgrading TNAV to Neutral,   meaning that we expect the stock to 
                                       perform in line with the mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months. 
                                       Long-term growth prospects associated with navigation and LBS solutions are now 
                                       offset by the risks of pricing pressure at key customers. We are establishing a 
                                       December 2011 price target of $7.00.

                                    Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                    We are downgrading TNAV to Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to 
                                    perform in line with the mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months. 
                                    Long-term growth prospects associated with navigation and LBS solutions are now 
                                    offset by the risks of pricing pressure at key customers, spurred by the availability of 
                                    'free' solutions from Nokia and Google. 

                                    We are establishing a December 2011 price target of $7.00 with this note (prior 
                                    price target $13.50, December 2010). The price target is based on an assigned 
                                    multiple of 6 times revised CY11E PF EBITDA of $71.2 million; the multiple is 
                                    based on the comms software/services peer group multiple. The market cap takes 
                                    into consideration $112mm and zero debt. We use 45.5 million shares to calculate 
                                    our per share price target. 

                                    Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                    We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                    following reasons: 

                                    •  Negotiations with Sprint conclude with more favorable pricing terms than we 
                                        have assumed. 
                                    •  TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate. 
                                    •  Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth. 
                                    •  New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs and 
                                        gross margins. 
                                    •  Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based navigation/mcommerce, 
                                        Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of expectations. 
                                    •  "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the market 
                                        or reduce their commitment. 
                                    •  TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                        growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                    We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                    reasons: 

                                    •  Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or negotiates terms that reduce 
                                        revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations. 
                                    •  AT&T, T-Mobile, or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                        TNAV, or  reduce pricing. 
                                    •  Free navigation from Google, Nokia, and Mircosoft captures market share owing 
                                        to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                    •  TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated. 

                                                                                                                     3

                                        •  Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 

                                        •  International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

       In their press release the company warned that their 55% customer Sprint could                                            S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)

       quarter. They saw growth across customers and segments. Sprints growth                                      Option volume (und. shrs., 1M avg.)             
       remains a very positive contributor in the quarter, but business grew elsewhere                             
       including AT&T, newly-won US Cellular,  AT&T, China Mobile and their non carrier 
       businesses as well. In MRM, they won a ma jor contract to provide asset tracking 
       for a large manufacturer (which we believe is Xerox).  

       Lowering price target from $12 to $9 and rating to Hold 
       We have valued Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 2% 
       perpetual growth rate in line with long-t erm industry growth and a 13% discount 
       rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta  of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%). Downside 
       risks the threat of continued competition fr  om free navigation providers such as 
       Google. Upside risks include the potential for a better-than expected resolution of 
       their Sprint contract negotiation.

                                that terms with their largest customer Sprint are being negotiated. 

                                Despite otherwise good results and what is likely a conservative Q1 guidance we think the 
                                renegotiation with Sprint could become a se      rious issue for Telenav. The chief risks 
                                associated with the company have always been  the high degree of customer concentration 
                                and the emerging threat of free navigation providers such as Google.  

                                It now appears that Sprints success at building subscribers with its bundled pricing plans has 
                                done well enough that they are looking to reduc e costs associated with that success.  We 
                                believe the success of the EVO Android phone fr om HTC as well as the progress of Android 
                                phones with other carriers may have prompted  Sprint to consider working more closely with 
                                Google. We do not believe that Telenav will be  displaced at Sprint, but  we do think they will 
                                come under pressure to offer more flexible prici ng terms. This may mean a further shift to 
                                advertising revenue for Telenav or some other  monetization method. The point being that no 
                                one can say what the new Sprint model for Te  lenav will look like. On the call the company 
                                was unable to answer many questions about   the subject given the ongoing nature of the 
                                negotiations.  

                                We also think the surprise here is not that Sprint is looking to bring prices down, but that they 
                                are looking to do so this early. The company  has long cautioned that over time they expect 
                                prices to go to zero for navigation. We th  ink the company received a discounted multiple 
                                relative to SaaS peers, in part because of th  e shift in business model from subscription 
                                revenue to a more ad-driven model. We origin ally expected that to occur over a number of 
                                years, but there is now the risk that the transition may happen much sooner. 

                                We do not mean to portray the situation as  overly dire. We see the most likely outcome of 
                                the Sprint renegotiating ending with lower pri  ces for Telenav, or possibly a split between 
                                smart phones for Google and feature phones for Telenav. But by no means do we think that 
                                Telenav will lose Sprint. There is still signific ant value in the companys operations. The main 
                                factor for the stock, however, will be the high  degree of uncertainty. Until there is more 
                                clarity over Sprint, these concerns will prove an  overhang on the stock. These concerns will 
                                likely overshadow any potential ne ar-term positive catalysts such as the announcement of a 
                                new carrier customer or a shift from a MRR plan to a bundle by AT&T.  

                                As a result we are lowering our rating from Buy to Hold. 

                                We are also reducing our forward estimates to reflect the potential for faster price erosion, as 
                                below.

30 July 2010       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                                  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei      r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin     g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

                                     •   Paying subs increased to 16,100 from 14,545 last quarter, representing 69% y/y and 
                                         11% q/q growth. This shows solid growth amid an environment of free turn-by-turn 
                                         competitor offerings. 

                                     •   ARPU of $1.03 vs. $1.11 last year and $1.02 last quarter. The decline was expected 
                                         due to the shift in end-user growth to bundled offerings. 

                                     •   TNAV was selected by U.S. Cellular, the nation’s sixth largest wireless carrier, as a 
                                         GPS navigation partner just after the quarter closed. As part of the deal, TNAV’s turn-
                                         by-turn offering will be bundled with the consumer’s wireless data plan and essentially 
                                         offered for free to data plan subscribers. Although this results in lower ARPU for 
                                         TNAV, it drives a higher subscription base and, ultimately, more revenue. 

                                     •   The company is currently in negotiations with Sprint for potential amendments with 
                                         its current contract. TNAV anticipates any extended agreement would result in ARPU 
                                         declines and reductions in total revenue from Sprint for bundled services, but an 
                                         increase in subs. This was anticipated, and the last time the contract was renegotiated, 
                                         the result was an increase in sub growth and higher total revenue in the ensuing 
                                         period. Prior to this negotiation, TNAV was the exclusive provider of Sprint Navigation 
                                         until December 31, 2010. Management has consistently said it will attempt to 
                                         renegotiate major contracts before their renewals.  

                                     •   Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter was $113M, up from $46M in FQ3/10 
                                         (pre-IPO). Net cash per share increased to $2.69 from $1.21 last quarter.  

                                     •   FQ1/11 revenue/EPS guidance $50M/$0.22 vs. consensus estimates of $49.8M/$0.21.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

Our $14 target price is based on 7x our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M. We believe 
this represents a very conservative view of what the shares are worth and, from a relative 
valuation standpoint, think the stock can trade into the high-teens with continued 
execution in the coming quarters.  

Investment risks 
Investment risks include, but are not limited to, customer concentration, competition, 
scalability, intellectual property and regulation.

                            the AT&T MRC subscriber base offset the shift to lower ARPUs? How are the 
                            Auto and TeleNav Track growth initiatives proceeding, relative to expectations?  
                            When can we expect to see meaningful growth from international markets, 
                            particularly at China Mobile? To what extent is the European TBT opportunity 
                            impeded by data roaming charges?  How soon will U.S. Cellular revenues 
                            benefit TNAV?

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     We maintain our Overweight rating, meaning that we expect the stock to 
                                     outperform the mean of our coverage universe over the next 6-12 months. TNAV 
                                     trades at 9.5 times CY11E PF EPS of $0.94, which is a 47% discount to the mean of 
                                     our coverage universe. We believe this discount reflects investors concerns relating 
                                     to declining ARPUs and margins, the competitive threat from Nokia and Google, and 
                                     the risks associated with an early-stage company that has just gone public. We 
                                     believe the stock is de-risked at this level and technology investors are presented 
                                     with a very intriguing GARP stock. 

                                     Execution should earn higher multiple in time. We take the view that TNAV is a 
                                     category-defining SaaS company, and can earn multiples that are comparable with 
                                     high-growth companies in that software category; however, in the context of near-
                                     term declining ARPUs and margins, competitive threats, and business model risk, we 
                                     believe this is a stretch as of today. TNAV needs to earn a higher multiple through 
                                     execution. We believe investors need to see evidence of continued adoption of 
                                     carrier-branded TBT navigation. 

                                     Taking a more conservative stance, we believe TNAV can be compared to 
                                     software-based companies that are focused on the telecommunications industry, 
                                     which include companies such as Amdocs, Neustar, and Synchronoss. The median 
                                     multiples for this category of companies are 11.6 times CY11E P/E and 6.1 times 
                                     CY11E EV/EBITDA. Using these multiples yields a valuation range of $10.90 (P/E 
                                     basis) to $13.70 (EV/EBITDA). We think this valuation range is conservative for 
                                     several reasons: 1) the comp group does not exhibit as strong a growth outlook as 
                                     TNAV, 2) we believe (higher) CY12 earnings will be a consideration for investors 
                                     soon, and 3) we believe the company can be awarded a SaaS-like multiple with good 
                                     execution over the next several quarters. 

                                     Our December 31, 2010 price target is $13.50 based on an assigned multiple of 6 
                                     times CY11E PF EBITDA of $84.7 million; the multiple is based on the comms 
                                     software/services peer group multiple. The market cap takes into consideration 
                                     $115mm of cash post IPO, and assumes zero debt. We use a post-IPO share count of 
                                     46 million shares to calculate our per-share price target. 

                                     Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                     Customer concentration risk 
                                     Sprint accounted for 54% of FY09 revenues, and the contract with TeleNav ends in 
                                     December 2011. In addition, we estimate Sprint accounts for nearly 12 million 
                                     TNAV subscribers today and TeleNav is approaching 25% penetration of the post-
                                     paid market at that account, so aside from the contract rollover risk, there is also a 
                                     risk that growth at Sprint slows soon. AT&T accounted for 27.5% of FY09 revenue, 
                                     and we expect revenue growth at AT&T to be higher than at Sprint, especially if the 
                                     operator begins to introduce bundling. The AT&T contract expires in March 2011.

                                     Free navigation available from Google, Nokia, and Microsoft 
                                     Google introduced Google Maps Navigation for use on Android 2.0 devices in 
                                     October 2009, and has since launched the free application in N. America and most of 
                                     Europe. In January 2010, Nokia announced the availability of free navigation with 
                                     Ovi Maps for use on S60 and Maemo smartphone platforms, which are widely used 
                                     in Europe. In May 2010, Microsoft announced that free navigation would be 
                                     available later in 2010 on devices running Windows Mobile 6.0 (and higher). Apple 
                                     offers free maps and driving instructions, and a variety of TBT solutions are 
                                     available for the iPhone and the iPad via the webstore. Free navigation is a serious 
                                     threat to TeleNav, and these large companies are able to subsidize these initiatives 
                                     indefinitely in a manner that TNAV cannot. 

                                     TeleNavs business model could change dramatically, with the onset of ad-based 
                                     navigation and search 
                                     Free navigation will be increasingly supported by ad-based revenues. J.P. Morgan 
                                     analyst Rod Hall estimates the LBA market could exceed $18 billion by 2015. 
                                     PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts a four-fold increase in global mobile advertising, 
                                     from $414 million in 2009 to $1.6 billion in 2014. TeleNav recognizes that the 
                                     paid navigation market (subscription based, or bundled) may not be sustainable 
                                     long term, to the extent that consumers are accepting of the placement of adverts and 
                                     coupons on their phones (some may want to pay a premium for TBT navigation 
                                     without the clutter). 

                                     Bundling and free navigation weighing on the business model in excess of our 
                                     expectations 
                                     We expect TNAVs ARPUs to decline about 8% y/y in FY11 to $0.95, stabilize in 
                                     FY12 (owing to a higher proportion of revenue from AT&T), and then decline 
                                     slowly for the indefinite future, primarily owing to the wireless operators 
                                     transitioning to bundling and ad-based navigation and search. We expect gross 
                                     margins to decline from a peak of 84% in F3Q10 to under 70% by FY15, and for 
                                     EBITDA margins to decline from about 47% today to about 35% in FY11. There 
                                     could be downside to the ARPUs and margins owing to competition and more rapid 
                                     adoption of bundling (e.g., by AT&T), though the latter could buoy subscriber and 
                                     revenue growth ahead of expectations. 

                                     Growth initiatives are somewhat opaque and risky 
                                     TNAV is engaged in some speculative software development (e.g., Whereaboutz, 
                                     OnMyWay) in pursuit of new markets that might not develop (e.g., LBS features in 
                                     social networking sites). We believe TNAV may make acquisitions in Europe to 
                                     accelerate growth. The company is delivering solutions to a modest number of very 
                                     large customers that have purchasing power and potentially the ability to stifle 
                                     contract announcements and news flow for competitive reasons, so the intra-quarter 
                                     information flow for TNAV could be modest. There are no good pure-play comps for 
                                     TNAV, and the resulting information vacuum could lead to considerable stock intra-
                                     quarter volatility.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst

J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

INVESTMENT THESIS  

TeleNav is the largest Mobile Internet company providing navigation-related services into 
the rapidly growing wireless applications marketplace. It is the largest provider of 
primarily wireless carrier “branded” turn-by-turn navigation services in the world, with 
14.5M+ paying subscribers via 15 separate wireless carrier partners in 29 different 
countries. Despite its rapid growth, TeleNav’s US penetration rate within its wireless 
subscriber base is still less than 7%, with most international markets remaining essentially 
virgin territories. As companies such as Google, Nokia, Microsoft and others begin to 
enter/offer “free” turn-by-turn services, overall consumer awareness will grow, along with 
TeleNav’s carrier partners’ interests in maintaining a strong menu of competitive offerings. 
TeleNav’s business model is closely aligned with its carrier partners’ desire to stay relevant 
in the expanding marketplace for wireless applications. Beyond continued strong 
subscriber growth within an under-penetrated marketplace, TeleNav also has strong 
offerings in both fleet telematics and in-vehicle automotive navigation.  

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU (average revenue per user)-driven 
revenue model provides excellent visibility into the company’s future financial health, 
while a solid balance sheet, highlighted by no debt and low working capital requirements, 
allows the company to generate substantial cash flow with very strong financial flexibility 
to extend its leadership opportunities via acquisitions . We are initiating coverage of 
TeleNav (TNAV : NASDAQ) with a $14 target price and BUY recommendation. Our target 
price is based on 7x our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M, well supported by both 
comparable and DCF analysis.  

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

Incorporated in 1999 and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, TeleNav is a location-
based services (LBS) and Mobile Internet company. Its core product is voice-guided turn-
by-turn navigation on mobile phones, but the company also develops solutions that support 
a broad range of location-enhanced applications, such as mobile advertising, commerce 
and social networking. The company’s LBS solutions, delivered through a hosted service 
business model, provide consumers and enterprises with convenient and easy-to-use 
location-specific, real-time and personalized features and functions. TeleNav provides its 
solutions through a network of wireless carriers in the US, as well as through certain 
carriers in other countries. Most carrier partners choose to preload TeleNav’s solutions on 
their new phones. Sprint and AT&T are its largest customers and represented 61% and 
29% of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2009, respectively. Although the company does offer 
its solutions under the TeleNav brand, it is more commonly delivered as a white label 
solution through its 15 wireless network carrier partners in 29 countries. Wireless carrier 
partners offer TeleNav’s services on either a standalone basis (AT&T Navigator) or bundled 
with other voice and data services (Sprint “Simply Everything” plan). As of March 31, 
2010, TeleNav had 14.5M paid subscribers across more than 500 types of mobile phones, 
all major mobile phone operating systems and a broad range of wireless network 
protocols. This subscriber base represents less than 7% of its US wireless carrier partners’

COMPANY SEGMENTS 

The large majority of TeleNav’s revenue comes from its voice-guided, real-time, turn-by-
turn mobile navigation service. The service offers real-time traffic alerts, route planning 
and updated points of interest (POI) among other features. The company offers its solutions 
to a lesser extent under the TeleNav brand through its two-way, Internet connected PND 
call TeleNav Shotgun. However, its offering is more commonly delivered as a while label 
solution through its wireless network carrier partners, with the most recognizable 
applications being AT&T Navigator and Sprint Navigation. 

In addition to its core product, TeleNav offers Mobile Resource Management (MRM) 
solutions for enterprises, in-dash navigation solutions for automotive users and solutions 
that support a broad range of location-enhanced applications, such as mobile advertising, 
commerce and social networking. These offerings contribute relatively little to the top line 
today, but are expected to increasingly gain traction in coming years.

In March 2010, TeleNav released usage data that show consumers use GPS navigation 
devices for more than just directions.  The data show that users also rely on these devices 
for finding nearby businesses and searching for local hotspots. The most searched for 
businesses by TeleNav users were Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Target, Best Buy and Bank of 
America. Pizza, Chinese food, burgers, American food and Mexican food topped the list of 
food searches. Also, the data revealed that more searches occurred in Los Angeles than in 
any other city and that more residents of Phoenix searched for gas prices than in any other 
city. 

Specific to social networking, TeleNav released a beta version of Whereboutz in 2008 that 
allows end users to share their location and status with friends on-line or via mobile 
phones. In the fourth calendar quarter of 2009, TeleNav launched a social networking 
application that connects end users based upon their locations and interests.

CUSTOMERS AND PENETRATION RATES 

Though TeleNav currently has 15 wireless network carrier partners in 29 countries, 
revenue from Sprint and AT&T make up the large majority of the company’s revenues 
today. In fiscal 2009, Sprint and AT&T represented 61% and 29% of consolidated revenue, 
respectively. As a result, there remain plenty of opportunities to grow the business through 
not only expansion of existing carrier relationships, but also through the addition of new 
carriers.

TeleNav’s current agreement with Sprint expires on December 31, 2011, but the 
company’s right to be Sprint’s exclusive provider expires on December 31, 2010. The 
current agreement with AT&T expires on March 19, 2011, and TeleNav is the exclusive 
provider of white-label GPS navigation services to AT&T Navigator during this time. 
Neither Sprint nor AT&T is required to offer TeleNav’s LBS, but the loss of either, or a 
change in pricing strategy, could be material. 

At the current 14.5M subscriber level, TeleNav’s US penetration rate is less than 7%. 
Management expects to announce the launch of one new domestic partner in 2010 and 
sees the international market representing approximately 10% of consolidated revenue by 
2012 (currently ~3%). The biggest opportunity here is China Mobile, which has 500M+ 
subscribers. Roughly 450K subscribers are paying for mobile maps and 50K subscribers 
have adopted turn-by-turn navigation, meaning that TeleNav has the potential to add 
meaningful subscribers to its base with the signing of China Mobile (expected next year).

REVENUE MODEL 

TeleNav’s services are offered by its wireless carrier partners on either a standalone basis 
or bundled with other voice and data services. The standalone service is provided via a 
monthly recurring charge (MRC), and although it drives a higher ARPU ($9.99/month; we 
estimate TeleNav gets approximately 50% revenue share per month from the carrier), it 
carries a lower gross margin than the bundled offering and overall MRC subscriber growth 
is much lower. In the bundled offering (i.e., bundled for free with a monthly data plan 
commitment), TeleNav gets slightly less than $1 per month per subscriber from the carrier. 
This lower ARPU is offset by much faster subscriber growth. This “white-labeled” strategy 
results in deeper integration with the carrier, an expanded subscriber base and higher 
revenues. Of its two largest customers, AT&T (29% of revenues) uses the MRC model today 
while Sprint (61% of revenue) typically bundles the service. We believe expanded consumer 
awareness of “free navigation” will drive more carriers to pursue a data plan bundled 
strategy, including AT&T. Management expects MRC price reductions in 2010 (baked into 
expectations), which should impact revenue in the near term but result in both higher 
subscribers and revenue in the long term. 

Average revenue per user (ARPU). As of March 31, 20Average revenue per user (ARPU). Average revenue per user (ARPU). Average revenue per user (ARPU). 10 (FQ3/10), TeleNav had 14.5M 
paying subscribers and an ARPU of $1.02. ARPU has trended lower as a result of the shift 
in end-user growth to bundled offerings and the company’s wireless partners’ white label 
offerings, both of which constitute lower monthly fees per end user. Despite the declines, 
ARPU is projected to grow higher starting by June 2011 from a changing user mix, an 
increase in AT&T MRC pricing and growing advertising revenue.

expanded availability of voice bundles to drive growth in the subscriber install base. The 
company is projecting 26M users by December 2012, which represents 40%+ growth y/y. 
As can be seen in the below chart, as usage increases, ARPU decreases but revenue grows.

Gross and operating margin. As of March 31, 2010 (FGross and operating margin.Gross and operating margin.Gross and operating margin.Q3/10), TeleNav had gross and 
operating margins of 84% and 42%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to decline to 
around 76% in C2011 due to declining monthly ARPU, increased subscriber usage (which 
increases COGS), lower margin on the auto business and the addition of a backup data 
center and other infrastructure investments such as staging servers and IT expansion. 
Management expects long-term gross margin of 70%. Operating margin is also expected to 
decline from current levels due to higher operating expenses and increased headcount. 
Headcount and related costs make up roughly 65-70% of operating expenses. Management 
expects long-term operating margin of 25%-30%. Though gross and operating margins are 
expected to decline over the next couple of years, the long-term projections (70%+ GM and 
25-30% operating margin) still signal a healthy and stable business.

NOTHING IS FREE 

In October 2009, the turn-by-turn navigation market was turned on its head when news 
that the Motorola Droid (launched on Verizon) would launch with free turn-by-turn 
functionality supplied by Google. Only a few months later, in mid-January 2010, Nokia 
announced free walk and drive navigation applications, using Ovi Maps, on its 
smartphones. Initially, the new version of Ovi Maps was available for download on 10 
Nokia handsets, with more expected to be added over the ensuing weeks. By March 2010, 
all new Nokia GPS-enabled smartphones included the new version of Ovi Maps. Since the 
announcement, the application has been downloaded more than 10 million times.  

While free navigation alternatives from Google and Nokia (and most recently Microsoft) are 
likely to take some market share, it is also expected to stimulate a larger carrier response 
and drive greater awareness for these applications. As consumers become more aware of 
the available offerings, we believe that they will see that TeleNav’s solutions compare 
favorably to the alternatives. Also, keep in mind that Nokia has only about 3% market 
share in the US, and while Android-based phones are today estimated at about 9% market 
share and growing, only Android 2.1-powered devices are capable of supporting its 
navigation application. Additionally, most wireless carriers continue to heavily influence 
the user experience on both feature phones and smartphones. This trend is not expected to 
change in the near term. 

Perhaps the most critical point to understand, though, is that despite Google’s and Nokia’s 
solutions being offered for “free,” consumers will still need a data plan to utilize these 
services, which could run anywhere from $25-70 per month. Both Google and Nokia will 
look to monetize their free navigation services through mobile advertising, search 
subsidization and carrier revenue sharing. TeleNav’s carrier-branded services increasingly 
come bundled with the data plans (i.e., Sprint’s “Simply Everything” plan), so it is 
essentially just as free as the Google and Nokia applications.

CATALYSTS 

Numerous opportunities exist for TeleNav to grow its business beyond our current 
projections: 

1.  New carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North America. T-Mobile and Verizon are the rica.rica.rica.
    outstanding US carriers with which TeleNav has only a modest relationship. T-Mobile 
    currently has about 34 million subscribers, while Verizon has about 91M subscribers. 
    Management expects that the carriers will adopt a bundling strategy, which comes at a 
    lower ARPU, but increases both the install base and revenues. TeleNav had a prior 
    agreement with Alltel to be the exclusive white label provider of navigation services, 
    but when Alltel was acquired by Verizon in early 2009 Verizon elected to discontinue 
    selling mobile phones pre-loaded with TeleNav’s LBS. Additionally, many Verizon 
    phones come pre-loaded with competitor Network-In-Motion’s (NIM) navigation 
    application. NIM was acquired by TeleCommunication Systems in December 2009. 

2.  Major ramp at China Mobile. TeleNav is the exclusivMajor ramp at China Mobile.Major ramp at China Mobile.Major ramp at China Mobile.e provider of TBT solutions to 
    China Mobile (deal announced late last year), but revenue from the deal is not yet 
    contributing to current growth. China Mobile has 500M+ subscribers, of which roughly 
    450K are paying for mobile maps and 50K have adopted turn-by-turn navigation. Any 
    material promotion of TeleNav’s services by China Mobile has the potential to 
    meaningfully contribute to TeleNav’s current growth. 

3.  New in-New inNew inNew in -vehicle automotive deals. --vehicle automotive deals. The automotive (in-dash) vehicle automotive deals. vehicle automotive deals. segment is expected to 
    represent less than 10% of total revenue in C2010, but grow to about 10% in C2012 
    based entirely on existing relationships (the ramp of FORD Sync). The company could 
    benefit from broader expansion of new OEM relationships in this marketplace as well. 
    Typically these solutions would generate a one-time royalty fee per units sold and

    recurring charge (MRC) model, which drives a higher ARPU ($9.99/month; we 
    estimate TeleNav gets 50% revenue share per month from the carrier), but it carries a 
    lower gross margin and much lower subscriber growth than a bundled offering. In the 
    bundled offering, TeleNav’s solution comes free when customers sign up for a data 
    plan and the company gets about $1 per month per subscriber from the carrier. AT&T 
    is expected to remain primarily a MRC strategy, but should it switch to a bundled 
    offering, TeleNav would be expected to benefit from a rapid expansion of subscriber 
    growth rates at AT&T. As an example, we estimate TeleNav subscribers grew from 
    approximately 500K to 8.0M+ in the two years following the bundle strategy launch at 
    Sprint. 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU-driven revenue model provides excellent 
visibility into the company’s future financial health, while a solid balance sheet, highlighted 
by no debt and low working capital requirements, allows the company financial flexibility 
in what is becoming a more competitive and challenging environment. Additionally, strong 
cash flow generation and low capital expenditure requirements facilitate growth from 
within.

ESTIMATES 

We are presenting our FQ4/10, F2010 and F2011 estimates below.  

For FQ4/10, we are forecasting revenue/net income of $47M/$10M. This assumes a paying 
subscriber count of 15.9M and gross margin of 81%.  

For F2011, our estimates are for revenue/net income of $215M/$40M, which assumes 
gross margin of 78%, operating margin of 31% and paying subscribers of 18M. 

Though gross and operating margins are expected to decline over the next couple of years, 
the long-term projections (70%+ GM and 25%-30% operating margin) still signal a healthy 
and stable business.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

We are initiating coverage of TeleNav with a $14 target price and BUY recommendation. 
Our target price is based on 7x our F2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M. We believe this 
multiple could prove conservative as TeleNav’s closest competitor, Network in Motion, was 
acquired by TeleCommunication Systems in December 2009 for almost 10x EV/EBITDA.   

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU-driven revenue model provides excellent 
visibility into the company’s future financial health, while a solid balance sheet, highlighted 
by no debt and low working capital requirements, allows the company financial flexibility 
in what is becoming a more competitive and challenging environment. Though gross and 
operating margins are expected to decline over the next couple of years, long-term 
projections still call for 70%+ and 25-30% levels, respectively, signaling a healthy and 
stable business. We see several additional upside opportunities (i.e., China Mobile, new 
Tier 2 North America carrier, material advertising revenue contribution, etc.) that are not 
included in management’s financial projections.

Four avenues to long-term growth 
Beyond its core business Telenav is developing four new growth areas  in-dash 
navigation with auto OEMs ; additions of new carriers  (including T-Mobile US and 
China Mobile); fleet tracking and mobi            le resource management; and mobile 
advertising. Of these, the first three are already generating revenue and short start 
to contribute more meaningf ully in CY11. Mobile advert ising remains a promising 
opportunity, but could take some time to develop fully.  
Valuation & risks 
The chief risk the company faces comes from free alternatives such as Googles 
for-free Navigation service which comes  bundled on many Android phones. While 
a threat, we think Telenav has an advantage   in its close relationship with carriers 
and their ability to offer their service on  a much wider range of handsets including 
feature phones, a market largely overlooked  by other providers. We have valued 
Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 3% perpetual growth rate in 
line with long-term industry growth and  a 12.5% discount rate (using a 5.5% risk 
free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%).

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                 

                                Investment Thesis 

                                Telenav is an emerging provider of mobile location-based services (LBS). LBS offers the 
                                promise of providing value to mobile subscri  bers through the application of Internet data 
                                offerings filtered for the users current geogra phic position. Telenav currently monetizes LBS 
                                by offering a turn-by-turn navigation service v ia wireless carriers for use on a wide variety of 
                                handsets. Wireless subscribers pay for this service through their normal cell phone bill and 
                                have access to a navigation service that provides real-time driving instructions, similar to the 
                                experience on a personal navigation device      (PND). Telenav is also working on further 
                                applications of its technology to other LBS areas. 

                                Consumer navigation is undergoing a rapid tran sformation. The age of paper maps is giving 
                                away to a variety of digital offerings. This began with the advent of PC-based mapping 
                                systems such as Google maps. The next stage  was the rapid growth and commoditization of 
                                the PND market which gave consumers a low-       cost, somewhat portable real-time driving 
                                directions. The next stage of this process will the widespread deployment of real-time driving 
                                offerings on mobile phones. We think these  offerings will be supplied through two channels 
                                 subscription services billed through the carri er, and over-the-top offerings supplied by 3rd
                                                                                                                              
                                parties on smartphones. Telenav is the leader in carrier-billed plans. 

                                TeleNav provides this software as a service (S   aaS) on a white label basis for carriers to 
                                supply under their own brand. Today TeleNav has over around a dozen carrier customers, but 
                                AT&T and Sprint provide the bulk of the co    mpanys customers and revenues.  At AT&T 
                                consumers opt-in to an AT&T Navigation su  bscription paying a monthly recurring revenue 
                                (MRR), while Sprint subscribers typically get acce ss to Sprint Navigation from Telenav via a 
                                bundled plan that covers voice minutes, a data  plan and a few other data services. Telenav 
                                also has agreements to provide service to oth  er carriers including China Mobile, Telcel in 
                                Mexico, T-Mobile USA and several others.  

                                Telenav is benefitting from growing consum     er interest in cell phon  e-based navigation, 
                                improving subscriber trends at Sprint and soli  d operating leverage derived from its SaaS 
                                model. In addition, we think  the company has four other growth legs which should start to 
                                contribute meaningfully in 2011 and beyond. Th    ese include: growth at other carriers; an 
                                enterprise-oriented mobile asset tracking busine ss; in-dash navigation  platforms with auto 
                                OEMs starting with Fords Sync platform; and further out the growth in mobile advertising. 

                                Risks and Valuation 
                                We see two primary sources of risk for Telena  v. The first is their dependence on a small 
                                number of carrier customers for their revenue  . Carriers are known to be very demanding 
                                customers. While we believe Telenavs relationship  with its carrier partners is strong, the risk 
                                exists that these carriers source navigati  on elsewhere or more likely pressure Telenav to 
                                bring down its prices. A second, related risk is   competition from OTT navigation providers. 
                                The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet landscape 
                                including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These th ree all offer comparable navigation services 
                                bundled with their mobile operating systems (O S) at no cost to carriers or consumers. We 
                                think Telenavs relationship with the carriers   shield them to some degree from this 
                                competition, but long-term expect pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. 

                                We have established a $12 price target for Tele nav. Our valuation is based on a discounted 
                                cash flow analysis using a 3% perpetual growth ra te in line with long-term industry growth 
                                and a 12.5% discount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 5%). 
                                We have also valued our company using comparable companies analysis. At our price target 
                                the company trade at 13 2010E earnings and 11x 2011E earnings. At these levels, the 
                                company would trade at a discount to our coverage universe multiple of 18x 2010E and 14 
                                2011E. We believe this discount fully reflects  the competitive pressure on the company and 
                                the associated risks.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                   

                                Navigation Trends 

                                Navigation has undergone a tremendous change in the past ten years. For thousands of years 
                                finding your way from point to point was t  reacherous or at best inconvenient. Maps were 
                                once closely guarded national secrets that could shape the fate of empires. As people 
                                became more mobile, especially with the intr     oduction of the automobile 100 years ago 
                                consumer use of maps has gone up considerably, but were still largely confined to static, out-
                                of-date pieces of paper. That changed dramatic ally in 1999 with the launch of several online 
                                mapping services including Mapquest and Google  Maps. With this dawn of the digital maps, 
                                navigation became incredibly easy and widespread. 

                                Today, it is hard to find paper maps at all.  This is profound shift, but one which has gone 
                                largely unnoticed as it gradually creeps into ev  eryday life. We see this whole evolution as 
                                similar to what happened with the notion of   time. For centuries this was immeasurable for 
                                most people outside of a small coterie of s    pecialists. Gradually clocks and then watches 
                                become so commonplace that they were woven into   the fabric of daily  life. Similarly, we 
                                think location or position is  becoming yet one more metric that will deliver value in new 
                                ways.  

                                The first step in this process is improved na   vigation systems. Digital maps have become 
                                portable, beginning with the in    troduction of in-dash navigation systems in cars. This 
                                portability accelerated five years ago with      the advent of relatively low-cost portable 
                                navigation devices (PND). The introduction of  low-cost merchant GPS semiconductors from 
                                SiRF brought navigation fully into the realm   of consumer electronics. Today you can buy 
                                PNDs for under $200 that can cover most of th e worlds drivable surfaces. Below we update 
                                our global PND model. Exact counts are difficu lt to come by, but we think the market likely 
                                peaked last year.

                                          One of the difficulties PNDs faced has been                      trying to determine penetration rates. The 
                                          market has typically compared PND  unit sales to estimates of ca r sales or cars on the road. 
                                          By that metric the market looks relatively  underpenetrated, with 2009 PND volumes equal to 
                                          about 6% of cars on the road in the US and                 Europe. However, PND sales in both Europe and 
                                          the US have exceeded auto sales for the past several years. Moreover, we think a better 
                                          metric of penetration is to compare PNDs to auto sales after factoring in-dash systems. Most 
                                          luxury cars today come with some form of in-d  ash navigation system built-in at sale. If we 
                                          strip these out penetration rates appear to be cl                 ose to saturation. We calculate this in the 
                                          chart below. Admittedly, this is not a perfect metric of comparison, as PND purchases are

                                          We do not think the penetration of position                 ing and location systems has come anywhere 
                                          close to peaking. However, we do think the method of distribution is set to move away from 
                                          auto-related channels, particularly the cell phone. 

                                          Mobile Location-Based Services 
                                          The next evolution of navigation is already                  well underway, with a shift from standalone 
                                          navigation sources to becoming just one more fe ature in the personal data device known as 
                                          the cell phone. 

                                          As with the rest of this proce ss, the shift in cell phones will have multiple steps. The first, is 
                                          the transition of current systems to cell phone   equivalents. This will include navigation and 
                                          mapping features. With time, however, combin                       ing precise positioning   data with mobile 
                                          access to the Internet will open up the field to a far wider range of offerings.  

                                          Companies are searching for new ways to make  money and deliver this value by giving users 
                                          data about things around them. This idea is known as location-based services (LBS). We 
                                          expect to see a wide range of business models  chasing this, and we already seeing dozens 
                                          of start-ups try different approaches. 

                                          As business models evolve, the underlying st                   ate of the industry will make these services 
                                          more readily available to a wider and wider audience. 

                                          The first technical requirement will be data-enabled cell phones. On the following page is our 
                                          global handset model. By our count 88% of the 1. 4 billion phones sold this year will be data-
                                          enabled in some way (EDGE or CDMA 1x and up                         ). This includes high end 2G phones with 
                                          some basic data capabilities, that could arguab ly handle navigation and LBS. Almost half of

                               Competitive Landscape 

                               Inside and Outside the Walls 

                               As navigation moves to the cell phone we ex pect to see a new set of companies providing 
                               navigation services. In the past, navigation   was largely a hardware-base offering either in-
                               dash navigation sourced from auto componen t suppliers or stand-alone PND vendors like 
                               Garmin and TomTom. On phones, navigation  becomes a software feature. Here, we see two 
                               primary sources of competition for Telenav  ot her providers of carrier branded, white-label 
                               navigation SaaS vendors and o ver-the-top third party providers who operate without any 
                               direct relationship with carriers. 

                               White Label Competitors 
                               Until recently, the only way to na vigate in real-time on a cell  phone was to work through the 
                               wireless carriers. Typically, these carriers did not provide the service themselves, but sourced 
                               solutions from SaaS vendors on a white-label basis, meaning the carriers attached their brand 
                               to the service. Qualifying as a  carrier supplier is a grueling  process, and typically on a small 
                               number of companies have the staying power to  provide carrier-grade solutions. As a result 
                               only a small number of companies today offer th  is service to carriers. In the US, there are 
                               effectively only two vendors  TeleNav and Netw orks in Motion which was recently acquired 
                               by Telecommunications Systems (TSYS, not rated). TeleNav is a supplier to AT&T, Sprint and 
                               T-Mobile US, while NIM/TCS supplies Verizon. In Europe and elsewhere there a number of 
                               smaller vendors in various stages of roll-outs . The most prominent of these was Wayfinder 
                               which was acquired by Vodafone in 2009, but has since been shut down. 

                               We believe this white label model is very st icky. There are considerable barriers to entry in 
                               the form of carrier qualification procedures. Furt her, carriers are unlikely to switch vendors 
                               once they have deployed a service. We have heard of instances when one white label vendor 
                               is able to offer significantly lower-priced servic es than an incumbent supplier, but are unable 
                               to gain entry to the carrier an  d displace the incumbent. From a carrier point of view, the 
                               benefit of a slightly cheaper service are far out weighed by the risks of switching. Since 
                               carriers typically operate under   intense regulatory and media   scrutiny any disruption of 
                               service that resulted from a switch would likely draw public reaction. This does not mean that 
                               TeleNav has signed up lifelong customers, but it  does limit the competition in the white label 
                               space to some degree. 

                               Over the Top 
                               An emerging trend is for consumers to seek navi gation and other data services from parties 
                               beyond the carrier. These are often referred to as over the top providers, as in coming over 
                               the top of carrier walled garden service offerings . In general, the over the top vendors only 
                               provide service to relatively open handset platforms, which effectively means smart phones 
                               only. By contrast, white label vendors spend si gnificant resources porting their solutions to 
                               be available on all phones offered by a particular   carrier. In the case of TeleNav, they have 
                               ported their solution to over 500 handsets, wh ich include smartphones and feature phones 
                               which lack a true operating system. 

                               In navigation today we see two classes of ov  er-the-top vendors. The first are independent 
                               developers who provide navigation apps. This  arena is largely limited to phone platforms 
                               with healthy app ecosystems meaning the Apple iPhone. A search on the AppStore for 
                               navigation typically yields aroun d 50 apps offering a  range of navigation  services. The best 
                               selling of these come from PND vendors who have ported their solution to the iPhone 
                               including TomTom and Navigon. The TeleNav solution is available on the iPhone, but we view 
                               this as a small opportunity for the company.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                   

                                The second category of over-the-top navigation  comes from smartphone platform vendors  
                                in particular, Google, Nokia and Microsoft.   All three have their own operating systems for 
                                smartphones, and all three have launched free        turn-by-turn navigation solutions. These 
                                companies have the advantage of vast scale and  the ability to pre-load their applications with 
                                their smartphone OS. The downside  of this is that  their offerings are ty pically only available 
                                on a limited number of handsets. 

                                This approach also raises concerns with carri  ers. Carriers are often wary of letting other 
                                parties get too close to their subscribers. Wirel ess operators today live in fear of becoming 
                                dumb bit pipes who offer commodity access          service at thin margins. While they are 
                                increasingly realizing that they cannot compete wi th Internet companies in many fields, our 
                                sense is that most carriers still feel they ha ve advantages in offering LBS and navigation 
                                services. We believe they are not comfortable giving up this service to other large 
                                companies. To some degree this should give          TeleNav a valuable a  lly in building their 
                                business.  

                                That being said, we see two risks from the over-th e-top providers. The first is that they are 
                                setting prices at zero and this will put pressure  on TeleNav to bring prices down, converging 
                                on free. Carriers have proven that they are willing to pay for a service they see as valuable, so 
                                we do not think this pressure will be intense or  sudden. However, we do expect a gradual, 
                                continual decline in navigation prices. We al  so expect carriers to in  creasingly bundle the 
                                navigation service as part of broader package as  Sprint has done. We will explore this topic 
                                further in a later section. A second, less like  ly prospect, is that the over-the-top providers 
                                succeed in becoming de-facto platforms for the   majority of phones. In particular, we think 
                                Googles Android platform shows some potential on this front. While this possibility exists, it 
                                will only come about after prolonged resistance fr  om carriers, and in that fight the carriers 
                                will need trusted partners like TeleNav to compete.  

                                Pricing Models 

                                Carriers sell TeleNavs services using two diff erent pricing models. The first is the monthly 
                                recurring revenue (MRR) in which consumers opt- in for an additional service paid monthly. 
                                AT&T uses this model. It charges consumers  $10 a month to sign up for navigation. The app 
                                is pre-loaded on most AT&T phones, but consumers  have to pro-actively sign up for it. This 
                                results in a higher per user fee paid to TeleNa v, we estimate this to be around $5 per month 
                                per subscriber. But it also limits the growth of the subscriber base. 

                                The second model is a bundled offering. In th is model consumers buy a bundle of services 
                                from a carrier which includes voice minutes, a  data plan and a small number of data services. 
                                In the case of Sprint, they have been prom       oting their Simply Everything plan which 
                                includes unlimited voice, data and texting for $99. It also includes Sprint TV, a Nascar service, 
                                an NFL service and Sprint Navigation, powered  by TeleNav. In this model consumers have 
                                TeleNav service but may not realize it. Sprint  pays a far lower price per subscriber to TeleNav 
                                here, we estimate this to be below $1 per month per sub. However, it results in a far higher 
                                number of subscribers. Of TeleNavs 14.5 million  subscribers as of March 31, we estimate 
                                that between 12 and 13 million are Sprint customers.  

                                These models reflect differing carrier motives. For MRR, carriers are looking for additional 
                                revenue streams. This has been somewhat successf ul. After traditional voice, text and data 
                                charges, we believe navigation has been on       e of the most popular carrier subscription 
                                services. For bundling, we believe  the primary interest is marketing. Most consumers will 
                                likely be ambivalent about signing up for naviga tion. However, for some the appeal of having 
                                that one extra service may be enough to convin     ce them to sign up for the bundled plan. 
                                Whatever this number is, it makes up for all the others, and thus serves as an effective 
                                marketing tool.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                      

                                 So the trade-off for Telenav is lower prices versus more subscribers. Is it better to get $5 for 
                                 MRR or $1 for a bundle. Given TeleNavs SaaS           model, the cost of each incremental 
                                 subscriber is very low. They have built a da   ta center which carriers a high fixed cost, but 
                                 additional resources beyond that are minimal.  As a result, they have tremendous operating 
                                 leverage. In general, they are better off with bu ndled pricing plans. The elasticity of demand 
                                 in this model such that at $1 per sub they typically get far more than 5 additional subscribers, 
                                 the ratio is probably closer to 12. So while revenue on MRR is higher on a per subscriber 
                                 basis, total operating margin dollars ends up being higher in a bundle.  

                                 The graph below illustrates this clearly. Th is shows subscriber count, average revenue per 
                                 subscriber, operating margin perc entage and total operating ma rgin dollars all indexed for

                                 total subscriber and more importantly total do     llar level TeleNav has   enjoyed significant 
                                 growth.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                              

                               The shift to SaaS gains steam 

                               The adoption of Software-as -a-Service solutions (and mo re broadly the popular moniker 
                               Cloud Computing) has been well-publicized,   and we estimate the   majority of venture 
                               money spent on software overall (majority in     application software) is now within this 
                               segment. While services-based software remains  relatively early stage, we believe adoption 
                               is accelerating and will be the  largest technological/business  model disruption the software 
                               industry has seen since client-server adoption in the 1980s. 

                               The proliferation of broadband makes it more fe asible to offer software over the web and via 
                               mobile phones. The compelling economics of an on-demand solution have gradually 
                               outweighed security and performance fears that  have previously hindered the market. More 
                               importantly, rapidly evolving business drivers,  which are compartmentalizing legacy business 
                               processes (outsourcing, globalization, a shift  to core-competencies) have made the current 
                               enterprise software model less relevant and are fu eling corporate acceptance of software-as-
                               a-service functionality to cost-effectively diff erentiate from competitors. Finally, momentum 
                               of web services integrations have enabled SaaS  firms to innovate much more quickly than 
                               legacy vendors and lessen the wide functional gap that had plagued immature vendors. 

                               A recently published IDC survey shows that comp anies expect, on average, 20% of their IT 
                               budgets will be earmarked for cloud computing in 2013, up from 14% in 2010.

                               A look at the technology 

                               We believe the technology is different than todays software stack as the code base needs to 
                               be developed and optimized for the Web, in a mu lti-tenant architecture. As such, successful 
                               applications are embedding more  advanced Web 2.0 capabilities  and scripting (AJAX, mash-
                               ups, etc.) to deliver robust functionally within the browser. Furthermore, we believe the most 
                               successful vendors longer-term will enable meta data customization that offer customers the 
                               ability to customize the presentation layer need s (as well as workflow and some other areas)

                                    Software-as-a-service enables economies of sc            ale through a multi-tenant architecture 
                                    approach (multiple tenants/customers are supported  on a single instance of an application) 
                                    that scales at lower infrastructure costs. This   is possible through the pooling of resources 
                                    (such as network connections and partitioning of large databases ensure efficient utilization 
                                    of resources) while still being able to diffe     rentiate data belonging to different customers 
                                    using metadata to configure the way an appl ication appears and behaves for its users. The 
                                    provision of shared services (billing,          metering maintenance of hardware & other 
                                    infrastructure) across all customers contributes to a reduction in fixed cost per customer.

              Customization is done at the Metadata layer in Multi-tenancy    this enables the SaaS provider to control the 
              application objects and the data dictionary in the Database
              Metadata layer abstracts customization to a separate layer      separating out the customization layer (M) enables 
              version-less software. Thereby concentrating R&D on one version, reducing application management costs, limiting 
              infrastructure costs, while enabling internet-type architecture scaling capabilities
              Virtualization doesnt limit application instances or database instances     Virtualization is driving IT costs down 
              by enhancing server utilization, enabling better systems management, and lowering admin costs by virtualizing the 
              layer labeled C above. This does not limit costs associated with changing the application or database and scaling 
              applications to internet-type performance is unproven in core business areas

                                    There are three popular implementation models in  the industry, of which we believe only the 
                                    multi-tenant model truly delivers a generationally more efficient delivery of software. 

                                        Hosted on-premise:  A commonly cited on-demand appr  oach from legacy on-premise 
                                        vendors is a delivery model that resembles that of a Managed Service Provider, whereby 
                                        customers have web-access to an on-premise              offering such that they maintain the 
                                        benefits of on-premise software (via customization) but outsource the data center costs. 
                                        A hosted on-premise offering (like Oracles legacy on-demand business or Microsofts 
                                        recent push on the Dynamics portfolio) does   not lead to significant infrastructure cost 
                                        savings.  

                                        Isolated Tenancy:  utilizes one application version with configuration capabilities 
                                        alongside a separate data model for each cu  stomer, thus enabling  modification to the 
                                        data structure and ease of transitioning to an on-premise version (SAPs traditional 
                                        model). 

                                        Multi-tenant SaaS:  Common among next generation SaaS vendors that utilize one 
                                        version of software for multiple customers wh ile leveraging metadata customization for 
                                        configuration and Web Services APIs for integration. The approach reduces server needs 
                                        as infrastructure is shared across customers for more efficient use of resources.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                                

                                    Telenavs solution architecture  is multi-tenant, allowing large deployments (now over 14m 
                                    subscribers) hosted on a common infrastructure that enjoys the scale benefits of SaaS. 

                                    Although the overall themes from our previous           reports on SaaS in 2006 [Software-as-a-
                                    Service: Opening Eyes in '07; Half the Market  in '13] and 2008 [SaaS and Cloud Computing: 
                                    End game clearer in '08 - Legacy checkmate]  continue and many are strengthening, several 
                                    new dynamics have emerged: 

                                    1.   Platforms are forming as cloud computing moves front and center - There is a more 
                                         pronounced push towards platforms-as-a-s          ervice. Cloud computing platforms have 
                                         emerged that enable corporate IT, ISVs, SI  s, and independent developers to build and 
                                         deliver SaaS applications over the Internet (without the heavy investments in 
                                         infrastructure). CRMs Force.com, Googles  App Engine, Amazons EC2 web services 
                                         are all gaining traction, helped by slow capital spending during the recent recession. 

                                    2.   Software and Internet heavyweights are star         ting to respond - Google, Yahoo!, SAP, 
                                         Microsoft, Oracle. However, the heavyweights  entry into SaaS has been tentative at 
                                         best. We see various struggles (similar to the reason for SAPs delay in 
                                         BusinessByDesign). Structural misalignment,  time-to-market with R&D impediments, 
                                         cannibalization threats, and  business model hurdles may all be potentially too high to 
                                         overcome 

                                    3.   Ecosystems appear to be changing - The larg er SI providers appear to be only dabbling 
                                         and seem reticent to significantly push SaaS, as the services attached are still relatively 
                                         small. However, all major SIs have initiatives to engage with many SaaS vendors and 
                                         many have built practices around extending  their historical on-premise competencies to 
                                         hybrid models that include certain cloud-based applications.

                               SaaS is distinct trend from other technological shifts 

                               We see SaaS and the shift to cloud computing as more than just a technology and a business 
                               model adjustment for the industry as it points to a migration to outsource much of corporate 
                               ITs administrative processes (i.e., storage, security, application management, database 
                               management, etc.) while accelerating the pace  of innovation and likely improving economic 
                               productivity more generally. This differs dramat ically from other trends pushed down from 
                               the CIO such as SOA (Services Oriented Ar       chitecture), Virtualization, use of software 
                               appliances, etc. New platforms and services   are being developed for enterprises moving 
                               beyond four-walled systems. Such a transfor  mation is likely to have a more pronounced 
                               impact on a corporations productivity than a shift in architectures within an IT department 

                               Marketing messages often cloud the value differences between 
                               SaaS and Virtualization 

                               While there has been increased rhetoric aroun   d different marketing messages and even 
                               some confusion as to virtualization technologi es being a substitute to SaaS, we stress that 
                               the use of virtualization technology to lower IT support costs for client/server software is a far 
                               cry and distinct from SaaS. We believe the value from SaaS is derived from multi-tenancy and 
                               provider control of one-version of software as th is drives faster innovation (i.e., focused R&D 
                               on one version), better scaling, and lower management and infrastructure costs. 

                               Multi-tenancy is most likely to perform at intern et scale only if customization/configuration is 
                               done at the metadata layer. This requires a   different approach to application development 
                               than the traditional client/server model, and take s time to tune and optimize and build mature 
                               functionality. Salesforce.com has been buildi  ng this for almost ten years and has only 
                               recently enabled complex workflow and business   logic rules. We believe competitors will 
                               have difficulty replicating this and anticipate  many iterations of development before they can 
                               match performance

                                  Service Delivery Platform:  TeleNav operates on a modular and scalable hosted service 
                                  delivery platform (SDP). This allows TeleNav   to respond to voice and data requests from 
                                  clients by bringing multiple types of in       formation together. Communication between 
                                  TeleNavs SDP and client softwa re installed on mobile phones or other GPS devices occurs 
                                  on wireless carrier partners networks. TeleNav s SDP can be scaled up by adding individual 
                                  service elements, such as application servers       or database nodes. The ease of capacity 
                                  addition enables TeleNav to serve a growing end user base without disruption in service. 

                                  TeleNavs SDP is closely integrated with it       s wireless carrier partners network. This 
                                  integration with networks allows TeleNav to ac  hieve efficient server load balancing and to 
                                  minimize downtime. Usin g proprietary applications, TeleNa v has successfully integrated its

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                       

                                 SDP with various third-party content providers.       This integration helps in the delivery of 
                                 enhanced location based services. 

                                 Client software: TeleNavs client application is designed to support over 500 mobile phone 
                                 models, operating on all major mo bile operating systems. The client software is adaptable to 
                                 evolving feature sets in new phones to create an improved user experience. It also works 
                                 together with the service delivery platform to  extract the latest inform ation, data, and other 
                                 services without the need to use phone memory  for data-intensive services like map and POI 
                                 storage. Requests made by end users are ca          ptured by the SDP interface using client 
                                 software. 

                                 Client software can be adapted to offer a      customized user interface to support preferred 
                                 features and functions. TeleNav can wirelessly   provide automatic updates of its service to 
                                 mobile phones without the need to upload new  client software. The client application caches 
                                 the route and navigation information at the beginning as well as during the trip, so that in the 
                                 event of a loss of or decline in connectivity du ring the trip, simplified  navigation services can 
                                 be provided. 

                                 Customers: 

                                 TeleNav primarily distributes and offers its      LBS to end users through wireless carrier 
                                 partners. These partners provide LBS to their subscribers either as a stand-alone service or as 
                                 a bundle plan combining various voice and data  services. TeleNav charges its wireless carrier 
                                 partners a monthly subscription fee for each         end user that subscribes to LBS. This 
                                 subscription fee is either fixed or derived on  a revenue sharing basis. TeleNav customers are 
                                 primarily concentrated in the United States      (97% revenue in 9M/10 ), with the remaining 
                                 revenues coming from Asia and Europe.  

                                 TeleNav derives a substantial portion of its re venue from two wireless carrier partners, Sprint 
                                 (55% of revenues in 9M/10) and AT&T (34% of revenues in 9M/10).

                                   TeleNav has partnered with various wireless ca  rriers to reach out to its end users. These 
                                   partners offer TeleNavs LBS to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle 
                                   with data or voice services. For customer su        bscription to LBS and activation for certain 
                                   services, the partners pay TeleNav a monthly f ee on a per-end-user basis. The subscription 
                                   fee is either fixed or derived on a revenue sharing arrangement wherein a minimum fee per 
                                   end user is defined. The monthly fee per end user is lower when the end user subscribes to 
                                   a bundle plan compared to a standalone            subscription. The revenue generated for any 
                                   subscriber varies and changes over time.

                                 Revenue has grown 82% from $8 million in 3Q09  to $15 million in 3Q10, primarily due to an 
                                 increase in end users of TeleNavs services. This is driven by an increase in subscribers to 
                                 Sprints Simply Everything plans as well as grow th in subscribers for AT&T Navigator.  The 
                                 average monthly subscribers have grown from  1.0 million in March  2008 to $14.5 million in 
                                 March 2010.  

                                 Since demand for mobile phones is higher du        ring the holiday season in November and 
                                 December, activations in these months al         so increase. Therefore, the business has 
                                 experienced seasonality during the past.  

                                 However, TeleNav has witnessed an 18% fall in  ARPU from $1.24 in 3Q09 to $1.02 in 3Q10, 
                                 mainly due to: 

                                     An increase in end users accessing TeleNav        services through white label offerings 
                                     launched by the wireless carrier partners     . The monthly fee per end user on these 
                                     offerings is lower compared to the branded offerings. 

                                     Bundle offer plans also fetch a lower per end user fee. 

                                 Nevertheless, the impact of decline in ARPU   was offset by the increase in the number of 
                                 average monthly paying end users.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                      

                                 Financial Overview: 

                                 Revenue Forecast 
                                 TeleNavs revenue increased 131% from 48 milli  on in FY08 to 111 million  in FY09. This is 
                                 primarily due to the introduction of bundling pl ans by Sprint and the resulting increase in its 
                                 subscriber base. This increase in end users ha     s more than offset the decrease in ARPU 
                                 witnessed during this period.  Since navigation  is increasingly becoming an important feature 
                                 of smartphones, we expect the number of LBS end users for LBS to continuously increase. 
                                 We have, therefore, modeled TeleNav revenues  to grow at a CAGR of 57% over six years 
                                 ($28 million in FY07 to  $265 million in FY12E). We expect Te leNavs subscribers to increase 
                                 from 3.1m in FY08 to 23m by FY12, with ARPU declining from $1.87 to $0.98.

                                 Margin History 
                                 TeleNavs gross margins have hovered in the rang e of 78% to 84% in the past nine quarters. 
                                 For 3QFY10, the company reported gross margins of 84%, up from 83% in 2QFY10. 
                                 TeleNavs gross margins are affected by declines in ARPU and changes in usage rates. The 
                                 company expects its gross margins to decline as ARPU declines and the cost of revenue 
                                 increases in both absolute terms and as a   percentage of revenue. Accordingly, we model 
                                 gross margins to decline from 82% in FY10 to 78% in FY11 and 75% in FY12.    

                                 On the operating margin front, TeleNavs marg       ins have risen substantially, from -9% in 
                                 1QFY08 to 42% in 3QFY10. The  company expects operating expenses to increase as builds 
                                 its infrastructure, add employees, and incur and  other administrative costs. Accordingly, we 
                                 model operating margins to decline from 40% in FY10 to 31% in FY11 and 29% in FY12.

                                  TeleNavs cash conversion cycle has fluctuated  over the years, increasing from 12 days in 
                                  FY07 to 71 days in FY08 and then declining to         40 days in FY09. This   was largely due to 
                                  fluctuations in the receivables turnover, which  increased from 48 days in FY07 to 109 days in 
                                  FY08 and then declined to 78 days in FY09.

                                Valuation 

                                Initiate with a $12 price target 
                                Our valuation is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a 12.5% discount rate and a 
                                3% growth rate. We obtained this rate us       ing a weighted average cost of capital in 
                                conjunction with the capital asset pricing model,  adjusted for Cisco's capital structure. Our 
                                growth rate is determined by comparison with  other companies in the industry, the overall 
                                industry growth rate, and overall economic gr  owth. Our discount rate is derived from the 
                                CAP Model using a weighted average cost of capi tal. The discount rate is premised on a risk 
                                free rate of 5.5%, a country premium of 5% and a beta of 1.4. The growth rate is based on 
                                our estimate of long-term economic growth. 

                                We think of TeleNav as a SaaS company that ha ppens to offer navigation services. As such, 
                                we believe the valuation should be bounded at the high end by SaaS leaders such as 
                                Salesforce.com and Concur, and at the low      end by navigation hardware companies like 
                                Garmin and TomTom. PNDs are flat-to-declin ing hardware businesses and not good comps 
                                for the SaaS-based TeleNav.  

                                TeleNavs high growth, solid margins a sticky   and scale-driven business should deserve a 
                                premium. However, TNAV is in a business mode l transition for which we apply a discount. 
                                Near-term, recurring subscriber fees (e.g., AT &T Navigator for $10 per mo nth) are moving to 
                                bundled services (ala Sprint),  which have driven most of the recent growth, but also pushed 
                                down ARPU. Mid-to-longer-term, free offerings  from Google, Nokia, Microsoft and others 
                                could further transition the business to   free-to-subscriber, paid for by new revenue 
                                streams such as advertising and m-commerce.  Th e first transition is already in progress, but 
                                its too early to accurately model the second transition.   

                                Our $12 price target embeds a CY11 P/E of 11x, in line with the PND vendors but at a 
                                discount to a broader universe of consumer electronics stocks. TeleNav is currently trading at 
                                an CY11 P/E of 8x, a discount to PND vendors 9x and the broader universe of 14x.   

                                We value our SaaS coverage on a cash flow basis using an EV/uFCF multiple, since we 
                                believe unlevered free cash flows are the best reflection of a subscription based business 
                                model. TNAV is currently trading at 6.4x on CY11 estimates vs. our SaaS coverage of a dozen 
                                companies at 25x.  The $12 PT would imply an       EV/FCF multiple of 14.3x, still at a steep 
                                discount to the peer group.

                                TeleNav primarily distributes and offers its   LBS to end users through wireless carrier 
                                partners. These partners provide LBS to their subscribers either as a stand-alone service or as 
                                part of a bundle plan. TeleNav derives approximately 90% of its revenue from two wireless 
                                carrier partners, Sprint (55% of revenues in 9M /10) and AT&T (34% of revenues in 9M/10). A 
                                high concentration of customers and absence      of long term exclusivity contract are risk 
                                factors for TeleNav. 

                                Intense competition 
                                TeleNav operates in an intensely competitive in dustry and faces stiff competition from larger 
                                companies with higher customer bases and sound er financial, technical, marketing and sales 
                                & distribution resources.  Developments like G oogles decision to offer free, voice-guided, 
                                turn by turn navigation to An droid based mobile devices and Nokias offering of maps on its 
                                smartphones to facilitate free  turn by turn navigati on could have negative implications for 
                                TeleNavs business operations.

23 June 2010       Wireless Equipment TeleNav                                                                                  

                                The free offering of LBS to subscribers may also  adversely affect TeleNavs relationship with 
                                wireless carrier partners. They may decide to t erminate relation with TeleNav, not market its 
                                services aggressively, or reduce subscripti on fees. Any such developments could hamper 
                                profitability, increase sales and marketing expense, and damage market share. 

                                Dependence on carrier partners for growth 
                                TeleNav is dependent on its carrier partners for marketing and distribution of its LBS. TeleNav 
                                relies on its wireless carrier partners to prom ote GPS enabled mobile phones that are pre-
                                loaded with TeleNavs client software.  

                                Shift in pricing plans 
                                TeleNav offers LBS to customers through direct  subscription or bundled plans offered by its 
                                carrier partners. Though direct customer subscrip tions result in higher ARPU, there has been 
                                a significant shift in TeleNavs customer base using its LBS through bundled service plans 
                                from wireless carriers. Growth of bundle service subscribers in the customer mix has lead to 
                                decline in ARPU from $5.49 in 2Q08 to $1.      02 in 3Q10. Though bundled services gives 
                                TeleNav the scale, they lead to decline in AR  PU, which, if not offset through new revenue 
                                streams and economies of scale, could lead to a decline in margins.

                              new markets, offset by declining ARPUs as TBT navigation is increasingly 
                              bundled. Gross and operating margins should decline, owing to bundling and 
                              aggressive R&D investment, but we believe EBITDA margins will trough at 34%,

                                     Key Investment Points 

TeleNav, Inc. (TNAV)                 TeleNav is a software-based provider of carrier-branded, turn-by-turn (TBT) 
                                     navigation and mobile search solutions, and as such, is poised to exploit a major 
Overweight 
                                     global growth opportunity arising from the convergence of GPS-enabled mobile 
                                     phones, smartphone operating systems, mobile internet access, and 3G wireless 
                                     networks. 

For more on TNAVs                   The addressable market for TBT navigation and mobile search is vast 
addressable market see Industry      By the end of 2010 there will be five billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide, 
Overview starting on page 16. 
                                     with over 324 million in North America and over 500 million in Western Europe, 
                                     two of the more developed wireless data markets. Wireless data revenues continue to 
                                     grow rapidly (~11% y/y in N. America) as subscribers increase their use of SMS 
                                     texting, email, internet access, navigation, and search, enabled by the availability of 
                                     inexpensive smartphones. In 2010, we expect over 360 million GPS-enabled 
                                     handsets (IDC) and 266 million smartphones (JPM estimate) to ship globally, mostly 
                                     pre-loaded with mobile navigation applications, or mobile storefronts from which 
                                     TBT applications can be downloaded. With the enablers in place, and growing 
                                     consumer awareness of TBT, subscriber growth is very strong. comScore estimates 
                                     TBT subscriber growth of 68% in Europe in 2009. TeleNav witnessed 91% y/y 
                                     subscriber growth in the quarter ended March 31, 2010. 

See page 20 for Gartners LBS        Location-based services (LBS)  an $8 billion market by 2012 
forecast, and page 20 for the        TBT navigation is a subset of location-based services, which should be a major 
JPM LBA market forecast. 
                                     growth market in the even broader context of the mobile internet. Gartner forecasts 
                                     LBS subscriber growth to be 46% through 2011, yielding nearly 300 million 
                                     subscribers by the end of 2012, and a revenue opportunity of just over $8 billion in 
                                     the same timeframe, a CAGR of 44%. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates 
                                     that the mobile Location-Based Advertising (LBA) market could top $18 billion 
                                     by 2015. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that mobile advertising will quadruple 
                                     from $414 million in 2009 to $1.6 billion in 2014. We believe TeleNavs application 
                                     portfolio will expand to exploit the broader LBS opportunity. 

                                     Wireless operators have a strong incentive to promote TBT navigation 
                                     Major wireless operators in N. America and Europe are pre-loading own-brand TBT 
                                     applications on smartphones and feature phones that they are introducing into the 
                                     market. The application is infrequently used and light on bandwidth, placing limited 
                                     stress on the network, but generates material incremental per subscriber data ARPU 
                                     when sold à la carte ($9.99/month at AT&T). Demand seems to be price elastic, so 
                                     when Sprint bundled TBT with a monthly data plan subscriber volumes grew 
                                     dramatically (now over 10 million, implying ~25% penetration of post-paid subs). 
                                     This could be strategically significant for the wireless operator, because the 
                                     application has personalization options that could make it sticky, a source of 
                                     customer loyalty, and the entry point to a broader swathe of carrier-oriented 
                                     applications associated with mobile internet, including mobile advertising and 
                                     mobile search. Essentially, TBT can defend the carrier from the threat of becoming a 
                                     dumb pipe. 

                                                                                                                        3

                                     TeleNav has more than 15 million subscribers, primarily on the Sprint and AT&T 
                                     networks, which represent a combined addressable market of about 130 million subs,

                                     networks). The companys TBT navigation application runs on more than 500 
                                     devices and on all major smartphone operating systems, both leadership positions. 
                                     The company has strong momentum as the OEM solution for Ford, running on the 
                                     Microsoft-powered SYNC platform, and is starting up operations with China Mobile, 
                                     the worlds largest operator. With over 800 engineers (more than half located in 
                                     China) and 10 patents (30 applications pending), TeleNav is a focused presence in 
                                     navigation and search, and is innovating quickly under the leadership of a strong 
                                     management team. The product platform, centered on TBT navigation, also includes 
                                     mobile resource management (MRM) solutions for businesses, auto OEM solutions, 
                                     social networking applications (e.g., Whereaboutz, Onmyway, Sipity), and location-
                                     based advertising. In our view, TeleNav is positioned to be a major participant in 
                                     LBS, navigation, and search on the mobile internet, competing with industry giants 
                                     that include Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. 

                                     There are multiple growth opportunities for TeleNav 
                                     We forecast a three-year revenue CAGR of 24% (through FY13), driven primarily by 
                                     a subscriber CAGR of 32% over the same period, offset in part by declining ARPUs 
                                     as TBT navigation is increasingly bundled. Subscriber growth should come from 
                                     deeper penetration of existing wireless accounts in the next two years, while we 
                                     expect revenues from China Mobile to be material by FY12. From near zero revenue 
                                     today, we look for Auto OEM solutions (initially Ford) to generate well over 5% of 
                                     revenue by the end of FY12, MRM to generate nearly 5% of revenue, and ad-based 
                                     revenues to represent 2-3% of overall revenue. There may also be a contiguous 
                                     opportunity to license or embed the TeleNav platform in social networking websites. 

We forecast $1.03 PF EPS in          The business model is already compelling 
CY10 and $0.94 in CY11 (higher       F3Q10 gross margins of 84% and EBITDA margins of 47% should decline, owing to 
share count). 
                                     bundling and increased investment, but we believe this low-capex, cash-generating 
                                     company should generate 70%-plus gross margins and EBITDA margins of over 
                                     34% even at the trough of the investment cycle. We believe free cash flow to equity 
                                     will steadily expand from about $34 million in FY11 to over $80 million in FY15, a 
                                     four-year CAGR of 26%, and EBITDA margins should climb to over 37% again as 
                                     the company begins to harvest some of the investment being made in the next year or 
                                     so. We believe TNAV can generate PF EPS of $1.03 in CY10 and $0.94 in CY11. 

See page 11 for analysis that        ARPU/Subscriber sensitivity analysis 
explores earnings sensitivity to     A key consideration for investors is the relationship between carrier pricing and 
subscriber and ARPU 
                                     subscriber adoption. To date the market has demonstrated strong positive price 
assumptions. 
                                     elasticity. By way of example, Sprint introduced bundling of TeleNav TBT in March 
                                     2008 when the blended ARPU stood at $3.85 and subscriber count was under one 
                                     million. A year later, the blended ARPU stood at $1.14 and the subscriber count had 
                                     jumped to nearly 8 million. Looking forward, we believe declining ARPUs will fuel 
                                     continued growth, but weigh on margins. On page 11, we include a sensitivity 
                                     analysis, which gives investors the ability to evaluate the estimated impact of 
                                     subscriber growth and ARPU decline on revenue, EBITDA and PF EPS. An 
                                     interactive version of this model is available on request.

                                     Investment Risks 

                                     Customer concentration risk 
                                     Sprint accounted for 54% of FY09 revenues, and the contract with TeleNav ends in 
                                     December 2011. In addition, we estimate Sprint accounts for nearly 12 million 
                                     TNAV subscribers today and TeleNav is approaching 25% penetration of the post-
                                     paid market at that account, so aside from the contract rollover risk, there is also a 
                                     risk that growth at Sprint slows soon. AT&T accounted for 27.5% of FY09 revenue 
                                     and we expect revenue growth at AT&T to be higher than at Sprint, especially if the 
                                     operator begins to introduce bundling. The AT&T contract expires in March 2011. 

See page 27 for more on              Free navigation available from Google, Nokia, and Microsoft 
competition and how we think it      Google introduced Google Maps Navigation for use on Android 2.0 devices in 
can be contained. 
                                     October 2009, and has since launched the free application in N. America and most of 
                                     Europe. In January 2010, Nokia announced the availability of free navigation with 
                                     Ovi Maps for use on S60 and Maemo smartphone platforms, which are widely used 
                                     in Europe. In May 2010, Microsoft announced that free navigation would be 
                                     available later in 2010 on devices running Windows Mobile 6.0 (and higher). Apple 
                                     offers free maps and driving instructions, and a variety of TBT solutions are 
                                     available for the iPhone and the iPad via the webstore. Free navigation is a serious 
                                     threat to TeleNav, and these large companies are able to subsidize these initiatives 
                                     indefinitely in a manner that TNAV cannot. 

                                     TeleNavs business model could change dramatically, with the onset of ad-based 
                                     navigation and search 
                                     Free navigation will be increasingly supported by ad-based revenues. J.P. Morgan 
                                     analyst Rod Hall estimates the LBA market could exceed $18 billion by 2015. 
                                     PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts a four-fold increase in global mobile advertising, 
                                     from $414 million in 2009 to $1.6 billion in 2014. TeleNav recognizes that the 
                                     paid navigation market (subscription based, or bundled) may not be sustainable 
                                     long term, to the extent that consumers are accepting of the placement of adverts and 
                                     coupons on their phones (some may want to pay a premium for TBT navigation 
                                     without the clutter). 

For how the business model           Bundling and free navigation weigh on the business model in excess of our 
could change with lower ARPUs,       expectations 
please refer to Sensitivity 
                                     We expect TNAVs ARPUs to decline about 8% y/y in FY11 to $0.95, stabilize in 
Analysis, on page 11. 
                                     FY12 (owing to a higher proportion of revenue from AT&T), and then decline 
                                     slowly for the indefinite future, primarily owing to the wireless operators 
                                     transitioning to bundling and ad-based navigation and search. We expect gross 
                                     margins to decline from a peak of 84% in F3Q10 to under 70% by FY15, and for 
                                     EBITDA margins to decline from about 47% today to about 35% in FY11. There 
                                     could be downside to the ARPUs and margins owing to competition and more rapid 
                                     adoption of bundling (e.g., by AT&T), though the latter could also buoy subscriber 
                                     and revenue growth ahead of expectations. 

                                     Growth initiatives are somewhat opaque and risky 
                                     TNAV is engaged in some speculative software development (e.g., Whereaboutz, 
                                     OnMyWay) in pursuit of new markets that might not develop (e.g., LBS features in 
                                     social networking sites). We believe TNAV may make acquisitions in Europe to 
                                     accelerate growth. The company is delivering solutions to a modest number of very 
                                     large customers that have purchasing power and potentially the ability to stifle 

                                                                                                                        5

                                    contract announcements and news flow for competitive reasons, so the intra-quarter 
                                    information flow for TNAV could be modest. There are no good pure-play comps for 
                                    TNAV, and the resulting information vacuum could lead to considerable intra-
                                    quarter stock volatility. 

                                    Company Description 
                                    TeleNav is a software-based provider of carrier-branded, location-based applications 
                                    delivered to GPS-enabled mobile devices, principally smartphones. TNAV consumer 
                                    applications include turn-by-turn navigation (voice and screen instructions), maps, 
                                    local search, and social networking. Enterprise solutions (MRM) include tools for 
                                    monitoring the location of vehicles and other assets and for optimizing a mobile 
                                    workforce. 

                                    TeleNav has ~14.5 million subscribers with 15 wireless carrier partners in 29 
                                    countries and covers more than 500 phone models and all major mobile OSs. The 
                                    companys product portfolio includes Mobile Navigation, In-Dash Navigation, 
                                    Enterprise LBS, and Mobile Advertising/Commerce. TeleNav was founded in 1999 
                                    and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California with a significant presence in China 
                                    and additional offices in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, and the U.K. As of March 31, 
                                    2009, the company had 878 employees of which 670 were in functions related to 
                                    R&D, with 331 in the U.S and 541 in China. 

                                    TeleNav began trading on the Nasdaq on May 13, 2010, under the ticker symbol 
                                    TNAV. 

                                    Earnings Overview 

                                    We forecast CY10 PF EPS of $1.03, PF EBITDA of $78.5mm, and revenue of 
                                    $191.5mm. 

                                    We forecast CY11 PF EPS of $0.94, PF EBITDA of $84.7mm, and revenue of 
                                    $234.1mm. 

                                    We forecast CY12 PF EPS of $1.13, PF EBITDA of $104.6mm, and revenue of 
                                    $289.5mm. 

                                    We look for TNAV to grow PF EBITDA at a CAGR of about 17% over the next 
                                    five years on a revenue CAGR of 22%. The loss of leverage relates to lower 
                                    ARPUs and gross margins originating from increased bundling of TBT navigation, 
                                    and a nearer-term investment phase that positions the company for longer-term 
                                    growth in the mobile internet. 

                                    Demand for TeleNav TBT seems to be price elastic. We think this is an important 
                                    consideration for investors. We note that in September 2007 ARPU was about $5.15 
                                    and TNAV reported less than 500,000 subscribers. Growth accelerated in June 2008 
                                    when Sprint started to bundle TeleNav as part of the Simply Everything plan, and by 
                                    December 2008, the total subscriber count approached six million. We believe 
                                    bundling by AT&T could have a similar effect, however there is no guarantee that 
                                    the price-elastic relationship will endure.

                                        We expect TNAV to report 4QFY10 PF EPS of $0.28, PF EBITDA of $21.5 million, 
                                        and revenue of $46.9 million. We look for FY11 guidance to align with our 
                                        expectations: FY11E PF EPS of $0.86, PF EBITDA of $74.7 million, and sales of 
                                        $210.1mm. 

                                        Revenue Outlook 

                                        Currently, nearly all of TNAVs revenues relate to consumer TBT subscribers at 
                                        Sprint and AT&T (90% of FY09 revenue). 96% of FY09 revenue originated in the 
                                        U.S. We believe MRM and Auto OEM revenues currently represent less than 3% of 
                                        total revenue. The subscription revenues are recurring in nature and the company has 
                                        good visibility into current quarter activity owing to real-time reporting of 
                                        activations.

                                        Contracts govern the carrier relationships. The Sprint contract extends through 
                                        December 2011 and the AT&T contract through March 2011. We expect both 
                                        contracts to be rolled over. Alltel is of declining significance to TeleNav (migrating 
                                        to Verizon systems). The Bell Mobility contract extends to June 2011; Rogers and  
                                        T-Mobile (U.S.) are three-month rolling contracts. 

                                        We expect TBT subscription revenue growth of approximately 49% in FY10, 25% in 
                                        FY11, and 37% in FY12. Subscription revenue growth should be fueled by rapid 
                                        adoption by subscribers, nearly 64% in FY10, 13.5% in FY11, and nearly 17% in 
                                        FY12; however, this should be offset by declining ARPUs through mid-FY11 owing 
                                        to increased bundling at Sprint. We expect a temporary rise in ARPUs in late FY11 
                                        owing to higher relative growth of monthly recurring charge (MRC) customers at 
                                        AT&T, but for the ARPU decline to resume in FY12 as AT&T turns to bundling and 
                                        other carriers in Asia (China Mobile) and Latin America (Vivo, Telcel) come on 
                                        board.

                                         We look for rapid growth in Auto/OEM revenues (Ford SYNC) and MRM through 
                                         FY12, though from a low base. We believe Ford will be deploying TeleNavs TBT 
                                         navigation on all new 2010/2011 Ford and Lincoln models, and that TeleNav has 
                                         potential to introduce similar solutions into other auto OEMs in the next year or two. 
                                         Regarding MRM, we believe TeleNav, in partnership with its telecom partners, will 
                                         more aggressively market its enterprise solutions next year, and build a more focused 
                                         direct sales team. Location-based advertising is likely to be a modest contributor to 
                                         growth in the FY10-FY12 timeframe.

                                         be material contributors to growth in FY13 and beyond.

                                      Earnings Outlook 
                                      Gross, operating, and EBITDA margins will likely plunge in FY11-FY12 before 
                                      recovering in FY13. This should originate in declining ARPUs, which will weigh on 
                                      gross margins. 70% of subscriber COGS is largely represented by licensing fees and 
                                      they increase with usage (which is increasing). About 30% of costs are fixed and 
                                      relate to data center and customer support operations, so there could be some longer-
                                      term leverage here. We do not expect gross margins to return to the peak 84% level 
                                      seen in FY10. 

                                      Operating and EBITDA margins should also decline largely as a result of the 
                                      pressure on gross margins. In addition, the company is investing heavily in new 
                                      products and services (R&D is expected increase over 70% in FY10 and over 40% in 
                                      FY11) and to support carriers in new geographies (more than 50% of the engineers 
                                      are located in China), and there is a significant increase in G&A (public company 
                                      costs) in FY10.

                                      Longer term, we believe EBITDA margins will trough at about 35%, and then 
                                      expand to about 37% through FY15 as the company scales growth with its newer 
                                      carrier partners and new products & services. 

                                      PF net income is forecast to decline in FY11 to $39.7 million from $43.6 million in 
                                      FY10, primarily due to a 10% decrease in EBITDA margins, but also due to a higher 
                                      tax rate (about 200bp). We estimate PF EPS of $0.86 will represent a decline of 
                                      about 23% in FY11 owing to lower margins, a higher tax rate, and a significant 20% 
                                      increase in the weighted average share count. 

                                      We expect PF net income to grow about 24% in FY12 as the company scales. We 
                                      look for FY12 PF EPS of $1.04, marking a 21% y/y increase. 

                                      Note that TeleNav carries negligible inventory, and that capital expenditure 
                                      (primarily relating to data center operations and office equipment) is modest at about 
                                      $10 million per year. The company does capitalize major software projects but the 
                                      amount capitalized to date is negligible. Non-cash stock compensation, currently 
                                      running at about $5 million per annum, normalized, is a consideration when 
                                      calculating pro forma earnings.

                                                                 TNAV is collecting cash from a small number of very sizable telecommunications

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     We are initiating coverage of TNAV with an Overweight rating, meaning that we 
                                     expect the stock to outperform the mean of our coverage universe over the next 6-12 
                                     months. At a closing price of $8.45 on June 21, TNAV is trading at 9.0 times CY11E 
                                     PF EPS of $0.94, which is a 49% discount to the mean of our coverage universe. We 
                                     believe this discount reflects investors concerns relating to declining ARPUs and 
                                     margins, the competitive threat from Nokia and Google, and the risks associated with 
                                     an early-stage company that has just gone public. We believe the stock is 
                                     substantially de-risked at this level and technology investors are presented with a 
                                     very intriguing GARP stock. 

                                     Execution should earn higher multiple in time. We take the view that TNAV is a 
                                     category-defining SaaS company, and can earn multiples that are comparable with 
                                     high-growth companies in that software category; however, in the context of near-
                                     term declining ARPUs and margins, competitive threats, and business model risk, we 
                                     believe this is a stretch as of today. TNAV needs to earn a higher multiple through 
                                     execution. We believe investors need to see evidence of continued adoption of 
                                     carrier-branded TBT navigation. 

                                     Taking a more conservative stance, we believe TNAV can be compared to 
                                     software-based companies that are focused on the telecommunications industry, 
                                     which include companies such as Amdocs, Neustar, and Synchronoss. The median 
                                     multiples for this category of companies are 11.5 times CY11E P/E and 5.9 times 
                                     CY11E EV/EBITDA. Using these multiples yields a valuation range of $10.80 (P/E 
                                     basis) to $13.50 (EV/EBITDA). We think this valuation range is conservative for 
                                     several reasons: 1) the comp group does not exhibit as strong a growth outlook as 
                                     TNAV, 2) we believe (higher) CY12 earnings will be a consideration for investors 
                                     soon, and 3) we believe the company can be awarded a SaaS-like multiple with good 
                                     execution over the next several quarters. 

                                     Our December 31, 2010 price target is $13.50 based on an assigned multiple of 
                                     6 times CY11E PF EBITDA of $84.7 million; the multiple is based on the comms 
                                     software/services peer group multiple. The market cap takes into consideration 
                                     $115mm of cash post IPO, and assumes zero debt. We use a post-IPO share count of 
                                     46 million shares to calculate our per-share price target.

                                             Industry Overview 

                                             TeleNav is a leading provider of software and services used to power carrier-
                                             branded TBT navigation and mobile search solutions in North America and 
                                             internationally. TBT and mobile search are early-stage examples of LBS, which will 
                                             expand to include mobile resource management (MRM), LBA, mobile social 
                                             networking applications, mobile commerce, and other applications and services. 

                                             TBT navigation goes mainstream with cheap smartphones. TBT navigation is 
                                             made possible by the convergence of digital maps, vectorized geographic 
                                             information, network-assisted global positioning systems (GPS), high-speed wireless 
                                             networks, wireless data infrastructure, and the availability of inexpensive feature 
                                             phones and smartphones that support multi-tasking applications. 

                                             TeleNav is a leader in TBT navigation. There are multiple participants in the 
                                             mobile navigation value chain, but TeleNav has emerged as a leading participant in 
                                             the emergent space, powering the Sprint Navigator and AT&T Navigation 
                                             applications, Fords SYNC TBT solution, as well as MRM solutions for use by 
                                             business customers.

                                                  GPS feature phones drive TBT adoption, too. TBT navigation is also being pre-

                                                  IDC forecasts that over 40% of handsets will be GPS-enabled by 2014, yielding unit

                                         MRM revenues could reach $1 billion by 2014. MRM represents a contiguous 
                                         LBS market that TeleNav is poised to pursue, directly and via the wireless carrier 
                                         channel. TNAV already has more than 9,000 small to medium-sized business 
                                         customers of the TeleNav Track service, partnering with AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon; 
                                         however, the revenue contribution is currently modest. 

                                         Frost & Sullivan pegs the MRM market as a $973 million market opportunity by 
                                         2014, and defines MRM as incorporating both handset-based and in-vehicle 
                                         technology that uses wireless and location technologies to locate, track, and manage 
                                         mobile workers, tasks, and assets.

                                         TBT OEM solutions for 30 million auto OEMs a year also a possibility. 
                                         Approximately 30 million passenger vehicles ship in North America and Europe 
                                         each year, normalized for the economic cycle. We are seeing evidence of increased 
                                         adoption of TBT navigation solutions in the driver dashboard. GM Onstar was an 
                                         early provider of concierge-type solutions and the solution will soon be enhanced by 
                                         the inclusion of Google TBT (service will be called eNav). This puts GM into a 
                                         more competitive position versus Ford, which introduced TBT navigation (powered 
                                         by TeleNav) into their SYNC platform and is making it available on all 2010/2011 
                                         Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Luxury automobiles, such as Mercedes and BMW, also 
                                         come with an in-cockpit concierge service, which includes TBT navigation (powered 
                                         by ATX Group). We believe TBT will prevail as an OEM solution over in-dash PND 
                                         solutions, owing to the ability to provide off-board real-time data, and because 
                                         voice interaction reduces driver distraction. 

                                         We believe, in time, all vehicles will come equipped with TBT navigation, or a 
                                         console system that supports it as an option, implying an annual addressable market 
                                         of 30 million (passenger) vehicles in N. America and Europe, alone.

                                             Multiple growth opportunities. Looking forward, we believe growth will be 
                                             centered on 1) deepening penetration of existing carrier subscriber populations (e.g., 
                                             Sprint, AT&T), 2) expanding geographic footprint (China, South & Central America, 
                                             Europe), 3) expanding into contiguous markets (MRM, Auto OEM, Enterprise 
                                             solutions, Social Networking), and 4) location-based advertising.

                                        TeleNav provides off-board navigation, meaning that the maps, navigation 
                                        instructions, and POI information is provided in real time over the air, from a 
                                        datacenter. The information is constantly refreshed (unlike a PND) and the 
                                        application can be continuously upgraded. The application, or software as a service 
                                        (SaaS), is hosted in the TeleNav Data Center. Building blocks of the application 
                                        include a LBS Platform (which enables the routing of relevant information to the 
                                        user based on XY coordinates, in the appropriate format), voice recognition software, 
                                        authentication and billing systems, and an ad publishing platform. Source 
                                        information includes GIS data, principally from TeleAtlas and Navteq, POI 
                                        information from multiple third-party sources, and local advertisements provided by 
                                        ad networks such as CitySearch, Yelp, or direct from advertisers (e.g., Best Western).

                                        We see LBA as a natural extension of mobile navigation and mobile search, and we 
                                        believe TeleNav is well positioned to pursue this opportunity, competing effectively 
                                        against much larger companies, such as Google and Nokia. Aside from the fact that 
                                        TeleNav already has the ability to reach 15 million subscribers, the companys 
                                        platform can be (and is being) extended to incorporate and deliver paid-positioning 
                                        (on search), coupons, and mobile banner ads. Importantly, we believe TeleNav is 
                                        able to implement ad-based search in a manner that does not undermine the wireless 
                                        operators relationship with the subscriber, and which yields revenue share to the 
                                        wireless operator. 

                                        We believe TeleNav is positioned to realize $0.20-$0.50 per billable event. The 
                                        revenue-share model will favor TeleNav or the operator depending on who sourced 
                                        the advertiser.

                                          Competition 

                                          Telecommunications Systems (acquirer of Networks in Motion) is TeleNavs closest 
                                          direct competitor, as a white-label TBT navigation solution provider (for Verizon). 

                                          TeleNav is also now competing with free navigation solutions from Nokia and 
                                          Google (Google Experience versions of the Android platform). Microsoft has also 
                                          announced its intention to offer free turn-by-turn navigation on Version 6.0 and 
                                          higher of Windows Mobile. 

                                          Free navigation is a threat, but it can be contained. We believe TeleNav is well 
                                          positioned to defend against the threat of free navigation, primarily because of its 
                                          close partnership with the wireless operators. First, wireless operators still control 
                                          which applications will be pre-provisioned on the majority of handsets, including a 
                                          subset of Android handsets. Second, its worth remembering that Android and Nokia 
                                          represented less than 15% of all smartphone sales in 1Q10 in N. America; Samsung, 
                                          LG, HTC, Blackberry, Motorola, Palm, and others are important suppliers and often 
                                          deliver product that aligns with the carrier specifications. Third, we believe wireless 
                                          operators will increasingly move to bundling TBT navigation, and as such, it is 
                                          perceived to be free by consumers. Finally, owing to a strong R&D presence in 
                                          China, we believe TNAV has a significant advantage in that nascent market. Finally, 
                                          TeleNav is introducing its own ad-based navigation capabilities, competing head on 
                                          with industry giants, not only in TBT navigation but also in the broader mobile 
                                          search category. 

                                          TeleNav competes with on-board navigation from the PND vendors, such as 
                                          Garmin, TomTom, and Mio. Garmin and TomTom have developed applications that 
                                          can run on mobile phones too. We believe the PND market will plateau and decline 
                                          as consumer adoption of TBT navigation on mobile phones expands. Off-board 
                                          navigation provides real-time information, applications can be updated regularly, and 
                                          provides reach into a deeper database of information, and is always on, always 
                                          available being on the consumers ever-present mobile phone. 

                                          There are a number of smaller companies that are also in the TBT Navigation space, 
                                          including Telmap, Jentro, Appello Systems, ALK Technologies, and Route 66. 

                                          In MRM, TeleNav is competing against Trimble, Qualcomm, and other enterprise-
                                          grade solutions companies. 

                                                                                                                                    27

                                       In the Auto/OEM segment, TeleNav competes against GM Onstar (now including 
                                       Google), ATX Group, PND (Garmin, TomTom), and OEM suppliers (e.g., Denso,

                                       Management 
                                       We have been monitoring TeleNavs progress for nearly ten years and we are 
                                       tremendously impressed by H.P. Jin, the CEO, who took this company from a very 
                                       early-stage venture through to a company that occupies a leadership position in the 
                                       nascent LBS industry, employing over 800 staff, and which partners with some of the 
                                       most demanding customers in the world of telecommunications and technology. We 
                                       think the company is run in a prudent manner, but has a very strong culture of 
                                       innovation, which we think is unique. Dr. Jin has also established a global 
                                       organization from the get-go. 

                                       Mr. Miller, the CFO, has impressed us with his steady piloting of the IPO process. 
                                       Thus far (pre-IPO), the companys results have matched or beaten expectations, and 
                                       we believe Mr. Miller has a good handle on how to communicate with the Street. 
                                       Both Mr. Jin and Mr. Miller believe execution is key. 

                                       H.P. Jin, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the BOD 
                                       H.P. Jin is a cofounder of TeleNav and has served as the president and a member of

                                      A geographic information system (GIS) captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and 
                                      presents data that refers to or is linked to location. 

                                      GSM Localization 
                                      It is the use of multilateration to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, 
                                      usually with the intent to locate the user. 

                                      GUI 
                                      Graphical User Interface is the software interface between user and hardware of any 
                                      electronic device. A GUI offers graphical icons, and visual indicators, as opposed to 
                                      text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation to fully represent the 
                                      information and actions available to a user. 

                                      GEOINT 
                                      GEOINT stands for GEOspatial INTelligence, which is an intelligence discipline 
                                      comprising the exploitation and analysis of satellite information to describe, assess, 
                                      and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the 
                                      Earth. 

                                      GPS 
                                      GPS is Global Positioning System which is a technology that gives the position of 
                                      any object with attached GPS receiver on the globe. It uses four satellites from a 
                                      constellation of 24 to 32 satellites (launched by the U.S.) to precisely locate the GPS 
                                      receiver. The official name of GPS is NAVSTAR (Navigation Satellite Timing and 
                                      Ranging).

                                      A location-based service (LBS) is an information and entertainment service, 
                                      accessible with mobile devices through the mobile network and utilizing the ability 
                                      to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device. LBS can include 
                                      mobile commerce when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at 
                                      customers based on their current location. They include personalized weather 
                                      services and even location-based games. 

                                      LBA 
                                      Location-based advertising relates to ad revenues that originate in knowing the 
                                      location of the consumer and using that information to provide context-sensitive 
                                      promotions, coupons, or other material that drives business to the advertiser. 

                                      MEO 
                                      Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) is the region of space around the Earth above Low Earth 
                                      Orbit (altitude of 2,000 kms) and below geostationary orbit (altitude of 35,786 kms). 
                                      The most common use for satellites in this region is for navigation, such as GPS 
                                      (with an altitude of 20,200 kms). 

                                      MRM

J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or analysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.

 Overview: 
 TeleNav is the leading provider of locati on based services (LBS) for mobile devices,  including the carrier-branded navigation applications offered 
 by Sprint and AT&T.  Its scalable, web-based platform integrates        third party map, point of interest and traffic data, deliverin g voice guided 
 directions on more than 500 types of mobile phones.  The company          has grown revenues rapidly by ta pping into its carriers vast  distribution 
 networks, and hopes to leverage its 14.5 million installed user base to gain a foothold in the nascent-but-promising mobile advertising market. 
  
 Rating Rationale: 
 TeleNavs hosted service model drives recurri ng, subscription-based revenues and strong  cash flows.  The company has rapidly an d profitably 
 grown sales of its core navigation product by leveraging the ma rketing and distribution infrastructure of key carrier partners,  though maintaining 
 exclusivity is a key concern given the high levels of revenue co ncentration.  Overall, its large installed user base provides a  first mover advantage, 
 but pressure from OEMs and OS providers with free navigation applications could intensify anticipated margin pressures.  
  
 Business: 
 Provides voice guided navigation services  for GPS-enabled mobile phones (94%), includ ing the turn-by-turn navigation applicatio ns offered by 
 leading US wireless carriers Sprint (55% of revenues) and AT&T (34% ).  In total, has 14.5 million end users and partners with 1 5 wireless carriers 
 in 29 countries. US is 97% of sales.  In tegrates third party content to provide 3D moving maps, points of interest (POIs), traf fic alerts, gas prices 
 and weather updates.  TeleNavs web-based delivery platform su pports more than 500 types of handsets and all major operating sy stems.  Client 
 software is typically pre-installed on mobile phones, allowing us    ers to access updated information and routing services without       using device 
 memory for map and POI storage.  End users are generally bille  d on a monthly basis through their wireless carrier, which offer   services on a 
 bundled (Sprint) or stand-alone basis ($10/month for AT&T).  Carri ers pay TeleNav monthly fees on a per-subscriber or revenue s haring basis.  
 Other 6% of revenue is generated from mobile phone-based workfo  rce management/tracking systems  (Xerox) and in-dash navigation s ystems 
 (Ford).  Also targets mobile/location based advertising.  Relie  s on the marketing and distribution channels of its wireless net  work partners to 
 drive adoption; also sells directly to end users through its website and mobile phone application stores (iTunes App Store).  R&D team consists of 
 670 employees, primarily located in China.  Leases data center space in Sunnyvale, Sacramento and Santa Clara.

 Latest Results and Outlook 
 
 Recent Financial Trends: 
 For the nine months ended March 2010, revenue increased 59% as a result of a 102% increase in average monthly paying end users, primarily due 
 to adoption of Sprint's bundled "Simply Ev erything" plans, which provide navigation se rvices at no additional charge.  The stro ng user growth 
 was partly offset by a 21% decline in monthly ARPU driven by an   increasing mix of carrier-branded and bundled channels, in addi tion to a fee 
 reduction from key partner Sprint; in July   2009, TeleNav agreed to lower Sprints per-us  er fees in exchange for an extension of   its exclusive 
 agreement through calendar 2010.  Gross profit grew 60% as the re sult of lower content and customer support costs, which were p artially offset 
 by the decrease in ARPU and rising per-subscriber usage rates.   Operating profit grew 77% due to strong leverage on sales and m arketing costs, 
 though adjusted net income grew more slowly  at 64% as the result of a tax benefit in th e prior stub period.  Cash flow from ope rations declined 
 by 9% due to a $14 million increase in receivables.

 Management has built an impressive track r ecord of rapid-yet-profitable growth and m aintains a respectable 12% ownership stake  following the 
 IPO.  The CFO has public company experien ce and executive compensation is very reasona ble.  That said, only one of six board me  mbers is 
 independent by our standards, and there was modest insider se lling on the deal ($12 million).  Nonetheless, managements solid  execution keeps 
 our governance rating at strong.

Renaissance Capital LLC (Renaissance Capital or RC), founde d in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991, is the global leader in 
IPO research.  Its clients represent the Whos Who list of t he largest and most active institutional IPO investors.  As an 
independent research provider, Renaissance Capital does not rece  ive payment for research or investment banking services 
from companies under coverage.   
 
In addition to IPO research, Renaissance Capital maintain     s the FTSE Renaissance IPO Composite Index, the definitive 
benchmark of IPO performance and activity, and it manages the IPO Plus Fund, the first mutual fund to focus solely on investing 
in IPOs.  The Fund has a 10 year track record.  FTSE is jointly owned by the Financial Times of London and the London Stock 
Exchange. 
 
Renaissance Capital was established by three Wharton MBA gra duates after they spent over a decade on Wall Street (Merrill 
Lynch, Citi, Bear Stearns, Kidder Peabody   and Credit Suisse First Boston) where they   worked in the areas of investment 
banking, helping young companies raise capital via initial public  offerings, as well as portfolio management, equity research and 
corporate financial restructuring.   
 
Institutional clients have valued Renaissance Capitals IPO research for nearly two decades because of its timely, market savvy 
insights on every US initial public offering and a growing roster  of non-US IPOs.  Renaissance  Capital augments its seasoned 
judgment with a proprietary, expert system for evaluating newly public companies. 
     
                                                                   
                                                       Important Disclosures 
                                                                   
                                                                   
Renaissance Capital Rating Distribution 
 
Renaissance Capitals composite investment ratings fall into three categories:  Outperform (15 to 20), Marketperform (10 to 
14) and Underperform (4 to 9).  These categories are defined as follows: Abov e Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform better than the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months.  Average: the subject company is expected to 
perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over   the next 3 months.  Below Average: the subject company is 
expected to perform below the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 3 months. 
 
For purposes of FINRA/N YSE disclosure rules, RCs  Outperform rating most closely corresponds to a buy recommendation; 
RCs Marketperform rating most closely corresponds to a hold/neutral rating; and RCs     Underperform rating most closely 
corresponds to a sell rating.  However Above Average, Average  and Below Average are not the same as buy, hold/neutral and 
sell ratings, as RCs stock ratings are determined on a relative  basis.  An investors decision to buy or sell a stock should 
depend on individual circumstances and risk tolerance.  For the y ear 2009, the distribution of RCs research opinions were as 
follows:  
 
 
                                                                   
                                 Outperform 20% 
                                 Marketperform 74.9% 
                                 Underperform 5.1% 
                                                                   
                                                                   
RC does not have an investment banking operation, and does not have investment banking relationships with any of the companies it 
researches, therefore no distribution of research ratings by investment banking clients are shown above.

The following table details the history of all RC research recommendations on TNAV since its initial public offering.   
 
                                                                   
                                                                  
Firm Certifications  
 
RCs research team is responsible for the rating and recommendat ion expressed herein.  Each member of the research team 
responsible for this report has certified  to RC that the views expressed herein accu rately reflect his or her personal views ab out 
the subject securities and issuer.  Accordingly, RC certif  ies that the recommendation, rating and views expressed herein 
represent the personal views of each member of the research team.  Further, no member of the research team was, is or will be 
paid compensation directly related to the specific recommendation, rating or views expressed herein.   
 
RC is a registered investment   adviser providing portfolio management services  to a diversified mutual fund, the IPO Plus 
Aftermarket Fund (the Fund), which is r egistered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
The Fund may take positions that are contrary to recommendati  ons expressed in a public research report published by RC.  
Also, the Fund may invest to a limited extent in the securities  of public companies that are the subject of a research report 
published by RC.  As a diversified mutual fund, the Fund is limite d to investing no greater than 5% of Fund assets in the share s 
of any one issuer.  As of the date of this report, the Fund does   not beneficially own 1% or more of  the securities of the issue r 
subject to this report.   
 
Members of the research team are compensat ed primarily from firm revenue on the basis of several factors, including quality of 
research, client feedback, stock picking, comp etitive factors and overall revenues of RC  consisting of fees from research and 
money management.  Members of the research team may also rece ive, as one aspect of overall compensation, benefits from a 
compensation program based upon an increase in the net asset value of the Fund. Although members of RCs research team 
(and their households) are prohibited from making direct inve    stments in the securities about   which they report, research 
personnel are permitted to invest in the Fund.  While the Fund       is limited in the amount it can invest in a single stock, 
compensation tied to the Fund or the performance of an investment  in the Fund, could indirectly influence a recommendation or 
rating on such a stock expressed in the report.   
 
In as much as neither RC nor any affiliate has investment banking functions, no research personnel are compensated directly 
or indirectly from investment banking revenue.
