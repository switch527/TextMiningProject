                     would expect a large number of new stores in its comp 
                     base would provide a consistent and reliable comp lift. 

                     Long-term outlook appears less rosy. Given 
                     significant comp deceleration, we revisited our 
                     bull/base/bear case scenarios and lowered our base 
                     case valuation to $16. While store openings are likely to 
                     continue to generate top line growth, we are concerned 
                     about EPS expansion after TEA reaches saturation 
                     (which we estimate is about 300-500 stores). We revise 
                     our base case price with our updated 2015 EPS 
                     estimate of $1.20. We believe TEAs multiple may 
                     continue to contract unless the company is able to show               Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
                     stable positive transaction trends and strong consistent              companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
