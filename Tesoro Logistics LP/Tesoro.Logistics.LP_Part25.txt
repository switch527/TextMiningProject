Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Takeaways From Earnings Call 
 
     •    Management expects to have an offer for a drop-down in the upcoming months but did not provide 
          details on the exact timing or size of the potentia      l acquisition. To note, our model incorporates an 
          assumed $100MM transaction in Q112.  
 
     •    Tesoro Corp. (TSO) announced plans to increase Ba kken crude shipments to its Washington refinery 
          (30,000 Bbls/d) and will invest $50MM to buil                d related loading and        unloading facilities. 
          Management noted that the asset (once completed   in late 2012) could potentially be a drop-down 
          candidate for the MLP. 
 
     •    Management anticipates quarterly EBITDA to appr oximate $14-15MM, which reflects the benefit of 
          the recently installed Salt Lake City ethanol projec  t, tariff increases as of  7/1, and new terminalling 
          volumes from TSO. This implies  a $5MM improvement on an annualized basis based on TLLPs S-1 
          guidance of $53MM for TTM 3/31/12. 
 
     •    Crude oil pipeline volumes have  recovered to approximately 60,000  Bbls/d, as most of the weather-
          related issues in the Bakken have been resolved. 
 
Off To A Strong Start With Q2 Results Ahead Of Expectations 
 
For the period beginning 4/26/11 (completion of IPO) and ending 6/30/11, TLLP reported EBITDA of 
$10.0MM, net income of $7.9MM, an  d available cash flow of $9.7MM. Adjusting these balances for a full 
quarter, this equates to EBITDA of   $13.8MM, $10.9MM, and $13.4MM,   respectively, which all exceed our 
estimates for Q2. Specifically, adjusted DCF/unit of $0  .43 was above our forecast of $0.35 primarily due to 
stronger than anticipated terminalling results, lower cash interest expense of $0.5MM, and lower maintenance 
capex of $1MM. For Q2, TLLP plans to pay a prorated  distribution/unit of $0.2448, which equates to a MQD 
of $0.3375 and an annualized distribution/unit of $1.3         5. The partnerships distribution coverage ratio was 
solid at 1.3x.

Crude oil pipeline and trucking volumes appear to be tracking in line with expectations despite weather-related 
disruptions in the Bakken during Q2 (i.e. 55,717 Bbls/d vs. our estimate of 56,352 Bbls/d and 23,212 Bbls/d vs. 
our estimate of 22,780 Bbls/d). However, terminalling  and short-haul pipeline thro ughput of 134,579 Bbls/d 
and 71,395 Bbls/d, respectively, were well ahead of our forecasts of 118,253 Bbls/d and 63,583 Bbls/d. Notably, 
management indicated that TLLP benefitted from a ~10,000 Bbls/d increase in terminalling throughput due to 
new TSO volumes. Additionally, short-ha ul pipeline volumes in Q2 benefitted from higher run rates at TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. 
 
Adds To Slate Of Growth Projects 
 
TLLP plans to invest $28MM ($23MM net of reimbursements from TSO) over the next twelve months to 
expand its crude oil gathering system and terminalling assets. The projects are expected to generate annualized 
EBITDA of approximately $11MM, which implies an                   average EBITDA multiple of 2.1x. Management 
announced three new projects (not included in the S-1): 
 
     1)   Rangeland Interconnect : TLLP plans to spend $3MM to connect its High Plains System to 
          Rangeland Energys crude oil loading terminal and pipeline facility. The project is expected to be in 
          service in Q212 and generate EBITDA of $1MM. 
      
     2)   Connelly Gathering Hub: The partnership will invest $5MM, which will be reimbursed by TSO, to 
          build a new gathering hub and rela  ted tankage and metering on its High Plains System by Q212. 
          Initially, 1,500 Bbls/d of crude oil will be dive           rted to the pipeline from trucking volumes. 
          Consequently, TLLP does not anticipate incremental EBITDA related to the project. However, the 
          investment should facilitate the partnerships ability to expand nearby gathering lines in the future. 
 
     3)   LA Terminal Permit Expansion : Currently, TLLPs Los Angeles   terminal is fully utilized. The 
          partnership plans to increase capacity by 5,000 Bbls /d. The project should be  in service by Q112 and 
          generate incremental EBITDA of $1MM.

Outlook For 2012 
 
For 2012, we forecast EBITDA of $74.5MM, which re presents a 36% ($20MM) improvement over 2011. The 
increase in our cash flow estimates  is driven primarily by estimated cont ributions from $10MM of forecasted 
growth capex in 2011 and partial contributions fr             om an assumed $29MM of growth capex in 2012. 
Additionally, our model incorporates a $100MM drop-d               own assumption in Q112 to be completed at an 
EBITDA multiple of 10x. In 2012, we forecast TLLP will increase its distribution by 14.0% to $1.55 per unit and 
generate a distribution coverage ratio of 1.2x.

Raising Our 2011-12 Estimates 
 
We are raising our 2011 and 2012 DCF/unit estimates to   $1.65 and $1.90, respectively, from $1.46 and $1.71 
primarily to reflect Q2 results, a                       higher run rate for TLLPs base earnings from terminalling, and the 
anticipated benefit from recently an  nounced organic growth projects. We   are also increasing our 2011 and 
2012 distribution/unit estimates slightly to $1.36 and $1 .55, respectively, from our previous estimates of $1.35 
and $1.52. Assuming a long-term distri  bution coverage ratio of 1.1x (TLLPs target), our 5-year distribution 
CAGR forecast increases slightly to 9.6% from 9.1%.

No Change To Valuation Range Of $26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on (1) our three-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate 
of return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow multiple of 
13.5x our 2012 estimate. Risks to the units trading below our valuation ra nge include a slower-than-forecasted 
rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.
