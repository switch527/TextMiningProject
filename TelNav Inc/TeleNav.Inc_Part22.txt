29 October 2010       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                              

                                Telenav reported 1QFY10 revenue of $51.1 million ahead of our estimate of $50.0 million and 
                                consensus of $48.6 million; pro-forma EPS of $0. 29 came in well ahead of our estimate of 
                                $0.20 and consensus of $0.22.  

                                Telenavs main customers, Sprint and AT&T , respectively represented 51% and 35% of the 
                                revenue. The new Sprint contract took affect  this quarter and will represent an amount less 
                                than the previous contract. Under this, Sprint pays Telenav a fixed sum regardless of 
                                subscriber count but the contract gives both pa rties incentives to add premium services. The 
                                AT&T contract is a revenue sharing agreement      and will be up for renegotiation in March  
                                2011. The company said, at this time, they meet  with AT&T regularly and do not expect the 
                                terms will change. 

                                In September the company updated its navigation -based mobile advertising platform and are 
                                starting to see some revenue growth in this     area. In addition, the company continues to 
                                leverage its core customer area to grow reven ue from premium navigation, automotive and 
                                enterprise LBS. However, these services still represent just over 5% of total revenues. 

                                Guidance 
                                The company guided earnings of $0.15 to   $0.17 per share for FYQ2, ahead of the street 
                                expectations of $0.13 and brackets our expectat ion of $0.17. The company also revised its 
                                full year guidance, saying revenue would be  between $187 and $192 mi llion and non-GAAP 
                                earnings would be between $0.70 and $0.78 per share. This is above the streets revenue 
                                estimate of $183 million and our estimate of   $185 million. The EPS estimate is above the 
                                street estimate of $0.62 and brackets our estimate of $0.76 per share.  

                                Financials 
                                The company experienced a drop of 14% in av erage revenue per customer (ARPU) to $0.94. 
                                However, they added 1.6 million subscribers and the total customer base now comes to 17.7 
                                million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by  $18.2 million, giving th e company a total of 
                                $131.1 million.  
                                 
                                Conclusion 
                                This is the kind of quarter the Telenavs business model should be able to deliver 
                                consistently. Unfortunately,   the changing nature of th      eir relationship makes such 
                                expectations unreliable. While the company did  a job of beating expectations, we have little 
                                confidence that they can keep up this pace inde finitely. Under their new  contract, Sprint will 
                                pay Telenav a fixed fee rather than on a per subs criber basis. Next quarter, with a full quarter 
                                of contribution, we should have a clearer picture of just how much Sprint is paying them. 
                                Regardless, we think some factors are already  clear. The average revenue Telenav generates 
                                is set to decline at a faster pace than we would have expected six months ago. ARPU is, of 
                                course, only part of the story, and total revenue  looks set to continue growing for the next 
                                several quarters.  

                                Beyond that, however, we enter somewhat un        charted territory. By the middle of FY12 
                                (2HCY11) the contribution from Sprint will li kely be a smaller share of Telenavs revenue. The 
                                difficulty will be determining what can take it  s place. While we are encouraged by the 
                                companys progress in rolling out its mobile ad pl atform, our sense is that this will still take 
                                many years before it can accelerate revenue       growth. In their late  st quarter, we saw 
                                encouraging signs in Telenavs numbers and in  managements commentary. Their mobile ad 
                                platform is growing. Hyper-local ads, location -based services, and mobile couponing are all 
                                very hot subjects in the Valley and venture ca pital communities. We are comfortable with the 
                                idea that there is a large opportunity here and  that Telenav has the potential to claim some of 
                                it. Unfortunately, the timing is opaque. We think it is likely that before this new leg of revenue 
                                growth can scale the traditional carrier busi  nesses will have slowed under new pricing 
                                regimes. This will make for several quarters of rocky transition.

                                Risks & Valuation 
                                We are lowering our price from $9 to $5. Our va luation is based on a discounted cash flow 
                                analysis using a 2% perpetual growth rate in    line with long-term industry growth and a 
                                15%discount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%).  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei     r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin    g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
