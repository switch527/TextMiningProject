    margin    expansion,    we    see    mea ningful    EPS    growth.    We    believe    the      
    company’s recurring services  model provides good revenue visibility. Last,                           12-Month Price Target 
    given its core Telecom Expense Management (TEM) solution provides  solid 
    ROI, we see Tangoe as somewhat recession-resistant.                                                   $27             
                                                                                                           
 •  Market leader in the fast-growing and underpenetrated TEM market.  Being >3x

 •  Sticky  recurring  model  provides  solid  revenue  visibility.  89%  of  Tangoe’s                     
    revenue in 2011 was related to recurring services and that  is expected to increase                    
    to 90-92%. Furthermore, we believe the solution is somewhat sticky after an initial     Company Information  
    investment in bill auditing and on-boarding of billing records. Last, with the average 
    recurring revenue of ~$150K for >800 customers, revenue is diversified.                  Shares Outst (M)                                         41.7

 •  Expect acquisitive strategy to aid growth and market dominance, but could 
    also pose integration risks.  Tangoe has acquired eight companies in the past                         52-Wk Range                     $8.01 - $23.05

    However,  we  believe  this  has  resulted  in  a  non-integrated  offering,  which  has              Cash/sh                                    $1.73

    somewhat rich. However, the model is in early stages of scale, and revenue growth                      
    remains  strong.  We  believe  solid  EPS  growth  should  justify  valuation,  but  is     Company Description

Investment Thesis 

Tangoe, based in Orange, CT, provides Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM) solutions to enterprises globally. Tangoe’s 
solution  helps  manage  the  ever-growing  and  increasingly  complex  fixed  and  mobile  telecommunications  expenses  faced  by 
enterprises.  CLM is a combined offering of telecommunications expense management (TEM) and mobile device management (MDM) 
services. Tangoe was founded in February 2000 and had its first public offering on July 27, 2011. The company currently trades under 
the symbol TNGO on the NASDAQ.  As of May 2012, Tangoe has 1,100 employees and 14 offices. 
We  like  Tangoe’s  leadership  in  the  large,  growing,  and  underpenetrated  markets  of  CLM,  TEM,  and   MDM  (mobile  device 
management). As the market leader with global scale, the argument that “you can’t get fired going with Tangoe” rings true. This should 
lead to additional share gains in these fast growing markets. We also believe the cost-savings of the TEM market could prove to be 
somewhat recession-resistant. As we believe complexity of telecom services and billing is increasing, we believe TEM solutions such 
as Tangoe’s should benefit as enterprises will find managing telecom costs and devices in-house more difficult. We see Tangoe gaining 
scale through solid organic and inorganic growth, which should lead to a doubling in EBITDA margins in the coming years.  
However,  we  are  concerned  about  the  early  stages  and  fragmented  markets  for  CLM  and  TEM,  which  has  led  to  a  plethora  of 
competitors  from  smaller  direct  vendors  to  systems  integrators  and  carriers.  In  addition,  we  wonder  if  customers  will  reduce 
dependence as their telecom expense management reaches more optimal levels via Tangoe’s solutions. We believe Tangoe also 
needs to justify its valuation through solid revenue growth and margin expansion. While the company does trade at a discount to some 
enterprise SaaS vendors, we do see Tangoe as a hybrid model with some custom and non-scalable services. Last, we see some risks 
regarding integration and distraction, given Tangoe’s aggressive acquisition strategy. Our checks indicate this has led to a somewhat 
fragmented offering from Tangoe. 
Overall, we are generally positive on Tangoe, as we see solid growth and margin expansion continuing and see the company as 
somewhat resistant to a slowdown in the global economy. While valuation appears somewhat rich, we expect solid EPS growth to be 
driven by 20%+ organic growth of recurring revenue (~90% of total revenue), M&A, and margin expansion. With 20% top-line growth 
and a doubling of EBITDA margins expected in the coming years, Tangoe looks much more reasonable on a P/E basis in the out years. 
We initiate coverage with an OUTPERFORM rating and $27 PT, which represents a 42x multiple on our 2013 cash-adjusted EPS 
estimate. This is in line with our long-term EPS growth rate of 37%, which we believe may prove conservative given the company’s 
leadership position in the fast-growing TEM market.

Key Investment Points  

Addressing a Large Untapped Market Opportunity in Telecom Expense Management 
According to Tangoe, enterprises spent $425 billion globally on fixed and mobile telecom in 2011. Tangoe currently manages $17.6 
billion or ~4.1% of the total spend globally, and Tangoe is by far the largest provider in the fragmented TEM market. We expect Tangoe 
to continue to penetrate this market through a combination of increasing customer penetration, new customers, regional expansion 
(namely Europe), and additional market share acquisitions. According to Gartner, the TEM market is expected to grow at a 22% CAGR 
from $894 million in 2010 to $1,951 million in 2014 (see Figure 1).

Increasing Complexity of Telecom in the Enterprise Should Favor TEM 
Historically, enterprises spent mostly on fixed voice services. However, over time, Internet, hosting, connectivity, wireless and other 
telecom services have penetrated the enterprise. This has increased complexity, the number of bills and vendors, and the number of 
connected devices in the enterprise. We believe this increases the challenges for enterprises to manage their telecom expenses in an 
efficient manner. Of note, through its ~750 customers at the end of 2011, Tangoe supports service coverage in over 180 countries and 
territories in over 125 currencies with support for approximately 1,700 different communications providers and 1,900 different billing 
formats. In addition, connected devices continue to proliferate in the enterprise. We expect smartphones to grow at a 30% CAGR from 
490 million in 2011 to 825 million in 2013. Gartner expects tablets to grow at a robust 44% CAGR from 60 million in 2011 to 369 million 
in 2016. We also see other connected devices penetrating the enterprise, further increasing complexity. Management has indicated that 
there is typically a 3% changeover in devices per month in the enterprise, which we expect to increase and further increase complexity. 
ROI Case for TEM Should Help Tangoe Navigate Potential Recessions 
Tangoe  provides  several  areas  to  support  the  ROI  to  its  clients  from  reduced  expenses  to  improved  productivity.  We  believe 
corporations  are  always  looking  to  reduce  expenses  in  a  non-disruptive  manner,  even  in  rough  economic  times.  Based  upon 
Wedbush’s proprietary Decision Metrics Survey, 29% of respondents indicated that service-provider savings was the top focus for 
savings. This compares to 59% indicating capital expense and 15% indicating labor. Service provider focused savings has ranged from 
19-36% over the past four years of our quarterly survey. We see several key areas of ROI from Tangoe’s solution including (1) reduced 
expenses  such  as  billing  errors,  overages,  unused  plans,  plan  optimization,  and  pooling;  (2)  increase  productivity  through  timely 
provision  of  devices,  applications,  and  access;  (3)  optimized  service  agreements  focused  on  capabilities  and  rate  structures;  (4) 
improved control and visibility through organization of bills and tools to analyze; and (5) better risk and policy management such as 
controlling unauthorized use, safety of sensitive data, and remote swiping of information.

Tangoe is the Market Leader with Scale and a Solid Track Record 
Tangoe currently has more than 1,100 employees supporting over 800 customers in over 180 countries and territories. Based upon our 
checks,  this  scale  has  proven  attractive  to  customers,  especially  multinationals  needing  global  support.  With  most  competitors 
generating <$20 million in recurring revenue in 2011, we believe this scale has proven to be a competitive advantage for Tangoe. 
Overall, Tangoe is at least 3x the size of its closest competitor, IBM. We point out that IBM is currently a key Tangoe channel partner, 
and recently acquired competitor Rivermine. That said, Tangoe’s management has indicated it is seeing Rivermine less in the market. 
However, we plan to closely watch this relationship. Checks also highlight Tangoe has a good track record keeping customers, which 
has led to a retention rate >90% according to the company. However, we caution that the TEM market remains in early stages.  

M&A Strategy Brings Additional Scale, Products, and Regions 
Since  2007,  Tangoe  has  made  eight  strategic  acquisitions.  Management’s  goal  is  to  gain  scale,  add  new  products,  and  expand 
regionally. In terms of scale, we believe it is a competitive advantage in the TEM market. Several acquisitions including TRAQ Wireless, 
ISG, HCL-EMS, Telwares, ProfitLine, and ttMobiles have improved scale and international presence. TRAQ Wireless and InterNoded 
brought MDM capabilities, while Anomalous Networks brought rTEM (real-time TEM), which enhances both Tangoe’s TEM and MDM 
products. In Figure 8, we go into further detail regarding Tangoe’s acquisitions. Thus far, we have been impressed with Tangoe’s M&A 
strategy as it has remained focused on its three-pronged strategy and the company has shown prudence in terms of price. 

Recurring Revenue Model Provides Solid Visibility 
Tangoe primarily provides its solutions on a SaaS-like basis after shifting from a perpetual license model in 2006. In 2011, 89% of 
revenue was tied to recurring technology and services and this is expected to trend to 90-92% in the coming years with the remainder 
coming from strategic consulting, software licenses and other revenue. We estimate Tangoe is currently generating ~$150K in annual 
recurring revenue per customer per year for its >800 customers with no customer >10% and IBM the only 10%+ reseller. With contracts 
ranging 2-5 years and renewal rates >90%, Tangoe has solid revenue visibility. 

Inherent Leverage Should Lead to Solid Margin Expansion with Solid Recurring Revenue Growth 
With data centers and a platform in place that recognize over 125 currencies and 1,900 billing formats with connections to more than 
1,700  communications  service  providers,  Tangoe  should  see  increasing  economies  of  scale  as  it  brings  on  additional  clients. 
Management’s target goal is to double EBITDA margins from 12.1% in 2011 to 24-26%. Management expects this to occur through 
improved gross margin (scale and revenue mix) and leverage in R&D and G&A, while investing in S&M. However, we point out that we 
expect Tangoe to have some ongoing margin pressure given it will be unlikely to fully automate its customer solutions, which should 
always require some custom/manual work. This is typically tied to billing formats that cannot be digitized and upfront services to get 
clients up and running.

Risks 

CLM and TEM is a Fragmented and Early Stage Market 
We see solid growth opportunities, but the CLM and TEM markets are still emerging and highly fragmented. While there is lots of 
headroom for TEM, the market could develop more slowly than expected, which could temper the high growth rates Tangoe has 
enjoyed.  We  also  believe  this  has  led  to  various  types  of  competitors,  from  smaller  direct  competitors,  divisions  of  much  larger 
companies, and even service providers themselves. We believe this could create confusion and various types of pricing in the market 
and even aggressive pricing in order to gain share during the developing years of the TEM market. 
Potential Diminishing Customer Returns 
We believe the ROI presented by Tangoe’s solution is very significant. However, we believe as initial efficiencies are addressed that 
additional ROI may be harder to come by. If customers realize or even perceive ROI is decreasing, they could reduce spending on 
Tangoe’s solutions or even feel they could take some work back in house. That said, given devices in the enterprise turn over ~3% 
monthly; ongoing M&A in enterprises, carriers, and billing systems; continued employee turnover; new types of telecom services and 
billing plans; and the increasing trend of BYOD (bring your own device), we believe there will always be meaningful inefficiencies to 
address in CLM. 
Ongoing M&A Strategy Could Pose Integration Risks and Distractions 
Tangoe has acquired eight companies in the past five years (see Figure 8). While most of these acquisitions have been moderate in 
size, we believe the number of acquisitions could prove a challenge to integrate simultaneously and a distraction to the business. 
Based on our checks, we believe technology platforms of previous acquisitions have not been fully integrated, leading to a fragmented 
offering. Going forward, we expect the company to continue to be acquisitive. In addition, Tangoe is still on the hook for $17 million in 
contingent consideration and deferred acquisition payments related to several of these acquisitions, which would create a drag on cash 
generation.  Last,  the  returns  on  acquisitions  may  not  meet  expectations.  Of  note,  while  we  believe  Tangoe  has  been  a  prudent 
purchaser, revenue from the HCL, Telwares, and ProfitLine acquisitions are down YoY, which we believe is due to some customer loss.  
Standardization or Increased Simplicity of Billing Provided by Operators 
The  driving  force behind  TEM  is  a complex  market of billing  and  operations support  systems,  and an increasingly diverse  set  of 
connected devices. As noted previously, Tangoe interfaces with >1,900 billing formats. Should consolidation in the BSS (Business 
Support Systems) and OSS (Operations Support Systems) markets continue and lead to more standardized billing formats, the need 
for third-party TEM solutions could be reduced. Likewise, an increased dominance of a device and/or O/S could also simplify billing. For 
example, Apple and Google have created their own payment systems and wallets, which could relegate carriers to billing for data usage 
(gigabytes) only. As Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems continue to gain share, this risk could increase. 
Increasing Dependence on Channel Partners 
Tangoe currently generates ~25% of its bookings through ~27 alliance partners of which ~two-thirds is through IBM, HP, Dell, and 
Xerox (ACS). Other key alliance partners include Bell Canada, Singtel, ISI, SPN, mobility, Insight, Advocate, webb, Pivotel, GQ AAS, 
Intersel, and others. We believe the increasing reliance on partners could reduce visibility into the pipeline and increase dependence on 
select partners. In addition, certain key channel partners such as IBM, which generated ~10% of Tangoe’s revenue in 2011, could 
appear  to  be  becoming  more  competitive  with  IBM’s  acquisition  of  Emptoris,  whose  Rivermine  subsidiary  has  historically  been 
competitive with Tangoe. Last, IBM and Dell have both been awarded performance warrants and IBM has the right of first refusal to bid 
for Tangoe.  
Varying Flavors of Competition 
We believe CLM, TEM, and MDM are all emerging markets with various types of competitors, from smaller direct competitors, divisions 
of much larger companies, and even service providers themselves. We highlight the TEM competitive landscape in tiers in Figure 10. 
We believe some smaller competitors could prove irrational with pricing in order to gain share, which could prove disruptive. Smaller 
competitors could also be more regionally focused, thus making it harder for Tangoe to penetrate certain markets. We believe larger 
competitors such as systems integrators (SIs), could offer scale, size, global presence, and a bundle of services to compete more 
effectively with Tangoe. Even partners such as IBM with its acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine, could become more competitive, though 
we do not see this as likely near term. In addition, carriers such as AT&T and Vodafone offer TEM services. Of note, we would highlight 
Vodafone’s  acquisition  of  two  TEM  companies,  Quickcomm  and  TnT  Expense  Management.  However,  we  believe  carrier-based 
solutions may prove challenging as most enterprises purchase telecom services through multiple operators in multiple countries. In 
MDM, Tangoe is more of an emerging competitor that is going up against several larger and more established competitors. Tangoe’s 
angle is the integration of its TEM and rTEM capabilities.

Company Overview 
Tangoe  provides  Communications  Lifecycle  Management  (CLM)  solutions  globally  to  a  range  of  enterprises,  helping  manage  the 
growing fixed and mobile telecommunications expense for its customers. CLM is a combined offering of telecommunications expense 
management (TEM) and mobile device management (MDM) services. The CLM market is accelerating as telecom expenses rise. 
Gartner estimates that TEM revenue will grow at a CAGR of 22% from $894M in 2010 to $1.951B in 2014. This market should grow at 
the expense of in-house TEM solutions, which we believe have proven inefficient. As of May 2012, Tangoe is the market leader in TEM, 
controlling $17.6B, or 4.1%, of the $425B in annual global enterprise telecommunications spend. 
 
Tangoe  operationalizes  its  CLM  via  its  On-Site  Communication  Management  Platform  (CMP)  software.  The  software  provides  a 
comprehensive solution for Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) and Mobile Device Management (MDM) and facilitates 
asset management, expense management, and usage management for communications assets and services. In addition to the CMP 
software,  Tangoe  provides  strategic  consulting  services  including  sourcing,  strategic  advisory  services,  bill  auditing,  inventory 
optimization, mobile optimization, and policy administration. The company has a diverse mix of clients and offers a value proposition 
that includes delivering a substantial ROI, and increasing internal efficiency through centralization of enterprise communications efforts.  
 
Tangoe commenced operations in February 2000 in Orange, CT as a provider of fixed TEM solutions. The company has since grown 
through organic growth and M&A expansion (acquired eight different companies in the past five years) and is viewed as the premier 
provider of a comprehensive fixed and mobile TEM solutions and an emerging player in MDM solutions. Following its IPO on 7/27/2011, 
the company trades under the symbol TNGO on the NASDAQ. Tangoe has 1,100 employees and 14 offices as of May 2012.

Products and Services 

CLM grows in conjunction with an ever-expanding communications environment. Adoption of connected devices and technologies such 
as smartphones, Voice over IP (VOIP), and tablets has resulted in a growing global telecommunications expense for enterprises and 
increased complexity.  In-house solutions are often inefficient and result in reduced productivity, security risk, inaccurate financial 
reporting, and dramatically increased expenses (a phenomenon referred to as “bill shock”). Figure 3 below illustrates a high-level view 
of the areas within the enterprise that Tangoe’s technology interacts with and provides. From a high level, Tangoe will review take in 
digital versions on telecom bills and details. Once on-boarded, Tangoe will monitor and analyze the flow of telecom expenses and help 
enterprises manage the costs in an efficient manner. Tangoe has also moved into MDM, which can help manage “bill shock” given the 
explosion  in  mobile  data  usage.  For  example,  Tangoe’s MDM  solution can  help alert  IT  managers  when employees are  roaming 
internationally without an international roaming plans.

On Site Communications Management Platform  
Tangoe enables CLM through its On-Site Communication Management Platform (CMP), which consolidates fixed and mobile TEM to a 
single location. Tangoe’s CMP provides TEM and real-time TEM (rTEM) solutions by providing on-site communication via third-party 
enterprise systems and Tangoe’s client groups, and providing accurate, real-time data and logs of communications. This software has 
three segmented packages, which provide a holistic CLM service: asset management, expense management, and usage management. 
Tangoe’s CMP represents most of the company’s visible recurring revenue. Tangoe engages in long-term subscription-based contracts 
with it customers ranging from 24-60 months.  
 
Strategic Consulting and Other Services   
Aside from CMP, Tangoe provides strategic consulting services, which consists primarily of services related to contract negotiations 
and bill audits. Contract negotiation fees include both fixed project fees and incentive fees driven by the amount of savings that the 
company  is  able  to  generate  over  the  customer’s  existing  communications  rates.  These  fees  are  recognized  when  fixed  and 
determinable, usually when the customer and carrier execute the contract. Bill audit fees are driven by the amount of savings that the 
company is able to generate by reviewing current and prior communications invoices against the customer’s existing contracts. These 
fees are recognized when fixed and determinable, usually when the carrier agrees to issue a credit or refund to our customer. Other 
strategic  consulting  services  include  sourcing,  strategic  advisory  services,  inventory  optimization,  mobile  optimization,  and  policy 
administration.

Revenue Model 

Tangoe generates revenue from two main operations:   its recurring technology and services revenue and its strategic consulting, 
software licenses and other revenue.  Prior to 2006, the company derived its revenue on a transactional, non-recurring basis.  The 
recurring technology and services revenue primarily consists of operations from Tangoe’s CMP platform, and is generated through a 
24-60 month subscription service, which includes a base charge and then additional charges based on customer threshold levels of 
telecom spend. The revenue is recognized at a given rate during the course of the subscription.  Strategic consulting services revenue 
consists mostly of bill auditing and contract negotiation fees.  Both bill auditing fees and contract negotiation fees rise relatively to the 
amount of savings provided, incentivizing customers through a value proposition.  

For TEM, management takes on customers with annual telecom spend as low as $5 million to well over $500 million. With $17.6 billion 
of annual spend under management and an estimated 890 customers, we calculate an average spend per customer of ~$20 million. 
We currently estimate management garners 0.7% of this spend per customer on recurring subscription-basis with a goal to increase 
this to 1.1-1.2% due to increased customer penetration and new modules. For MDM, Tangoe gets paid per device under management 
in a very wide range of $1-15 annually. Management indicated that it currently has 2.5 million devices under management.

Strategy 

Tangoe maintains a tripartite growth strategy: (A) increased scalability, (B) technological growth, and (C) international expansion.  The 
specific mechanisms to enable this strategy are as follows: 
•   Increase customer base (A/C)  - Tangoe aims to continue adopting new customers. This has been accomplished through a hybrid 
    of  organic  growth  and  inorganic  growth  via  augmentation  of  competitors  and  expansion  into  MDM  services.  The  last  five 
    acquisitions (HCL-EMS, Telwares, ProfitLine, Anomalous, and ttMobiles) has brought in >255 customers to Tangoe’s customer 
    base of well more than 800 enterprises. Looking forward, Tangoe anticipates continuing this trend through the addition of sales and 
    marketing personnel, so it can effectively market to new enterprises.   
•   Continue trend of successful acquisitions (A/B/C)  - Tangoe has synergized its organic growth with its acquisitions, increasing 
    its scalability, technological capabilities, and international presence, while eliminating competitors in a highly fragmented market.  
    Through its pipeline of acquisitions, Tangoe is developing a more comprehensive CLM solution, providing a portfolio of TEM, 
    rTEM, and MDM solutions to enterprises globally.  Looking forward, Tangoe will continue practicing this three-fold acquisition 
    philosophy—gaining scalability, increasing technological capabilities, and penetrating international markets.  
•   Further penetrate international markets (C)  – Development of Asian, European, and Latin American markets provide a rich, 
    potential growth driver for TEM and MDM solutions.  On an annual basis, Tangoe manages $4.6b in international communications 
    expense, which equals 27.4% of its total managed communications expense.   The uncertainty global enterprises face regarding 
    TEM and MDM, combined with the inefficiency of first-party solutions logically points to the proven value proposition offered by 
    Tangoe.  With the acquisition of ttMobiles, Tangoe has established a presence in the UK.  Tangoe offers a globally capable 
    software solution, offering support for 1,700 different communications carriers (80% of global communications carriers) and 1,900 
    different formats in 16 different languages processed by 97 global invoice processing centers.  To continue expansion, Tangoe 
    plans  to  continue  growing  new  customers  and  operations  in  global  markets  both  by  hiring  additional  sales  and  operations 
    personnel, and by further localizing their CMP software. 
•   Use  and  continue  building  successful  strategic  alliances  (A)   -  Tangoe  has  existing  strategic  alliances  with  major  global 
    enterprises such as Dell, IBM, and Xerox, and additional mobile service relationships with Bell Canada, SingTel, Starhub, and 
    Telefonica.    Currently,  25%  of  Tangoe’s  bookings  are  coming  from  partners.  Looking  forward,  Tangoe  seeks  to  make  more 
    alliances and leverage these alliance relationships in conjunction with sales efforts to increase its customer base and operations.  
•   Continue providing and further extend CLM solution (B/C)  - Tangoe is the leader in providing CLM solutions, and seeks to 
    continue expansion of its consolidated fixed and mobile CLM solution through further technological and service development, and 
    localization into new domestic and international locations.   
•   Renew  and  expand  existing  customer  relationships  (A)  –  Management  currently  believes  it  has  penetrated  the  existing 
    customer opportunity by ~30% and sees opportunity to expand globally with multinationals and by selling additional modules and 
    applications that drive additional ROI.  As new technologies and connected devices such as VoIP, smartphones, and tablets 
    become  more  readily  adopted  by  enterprises,  Tangoe  will  grow  its  CLM  solution  to  accommodate  increased  expenses  of 
    communications assets and services.  This expansion will be seen in TEM, but more so in MDM.

Mergers and Acquisitions  

Tangoe’s  M&A  strategy  is  driven  by  three  primary  characteristics:    increase  of  scale,  technological  capabilities  and  international 
presence.  Its M&A strategy catalyzed Tangoe’s penetration of MDM solutions, and its expansion into the global market.  Its history of 
M&A is as follows: 
 
TRAQ Wireless —On March 9, 2007, Tangoe merged with TRAQ Wireless, a provider of wireless TEM solutions.  With the merger of 
TRAQ Wireless, Tangoe not only increased its business scale, but also penetrated the wireless TEM space and expanded its platform 
to include MDM functionalities.  This merger aligned Tangoe with the flourishing enterprise MDM demand, and allowed it to provide a 
consolidated package of both fixed and wireless TEM. 
 
Information Strategies Group (ISG) —On July 5, 2008, Tangoe acquired ISG, a provider of telecommunications expense processing 
services and technology.  With the acquisition of ISG, Tangoe improved the functionality of its expense management service, and 
enhanced its technological profile with ISG’s call accounting product and billing chargeback and allocation software.  
 
InterNoded Inc. —On December 23, 2008, Tangoe acquired InterNoded, a global provider of MDM solutions.  With the acquisition of 
InterNoded, Tangoe expanded its business scale by gaining new customers, and strengthened its global MDM solution.  
 
HCL-EMS —On January 5, 2011, Tangoe acquired HCL Expense Management Services (HCL-EMS), a provider of fixed and mobile 
TEM solutions.  With the acquisition of HCL-EMS, Tangoe grew its scalability, gaining multiple processing centers, operation personnel, 
new customers, and new operations.  Moreover, Tangoe stretched its global reach by augmenting a competitor in global TEM space. 
 
Telwares —On March 16, 2011, Tangoe acquired Telwares’ division of TEM, and announced a strategic global alliance with Telwares.  
Tangoe continued to increase the scale of its business, acquiring Telwares’ invoice management, call accounting, and MDM solutions. 
 
ProfitLine —On December 19, 2011, Tangoe acquired ProfitLine, a global provider of TEM and MDM services.  With this acquisition, 
Tangoe digested a global provider of TEM and MDM solutions, increasing Tangoe’s scale by integrating new personnel, customers, 
and operations. 
 
Anomalous Networks —On January 10, 2012, Tangoe acquired Anomalous Networks, a provider of real-time TEM (rTEM) solutions 
for  communications  devices  such  as  smartphones,  tablets,  PCs,  and  modem-enabled.    Adding  rTEM  to  its  technological  profile 
furthered Tangoe’s CLM capabilities in both fixed TEM and MDM, as rTEM functionality allows Tangoe to provide services such as 
“predictive cost intelligence, ‘bill shock’ prevention, user alert acknowledgement tracking, usage anomaly detection, and enhanced 
policy enforcement.”  This process results in better TEM data accuracy. 
 
ttMobiles —On February 21, 2012, Tangoe acquired ttMobiles, a MDM services and solutions provider to UK enterprises.  Tangoe 
again extended its global reach, and focused specifically on the European market.  Tangoe also integrated ttMobiles sundry functions 
including  mobile  sourcing,  provider  migration,  localized  charge  auditing,  personal  call  management,  cost  control,  recorded  call 
management, fleet administration, and complete outsourced mobile management.

Customers 

 

Tangoe claims a customer base of over 800 that stretch across a range of enterprise verticals. Based upon our analysis, we believe 
Tangoe is nearing 900 total customers. Tangoe acquires customers through a combination of internal wins and M&A. Of note, in 2011, 
we  estimate  Tangoe  added  255  customers  with  105  added  organically  and  150  through  the  acquisitions  of  HCL,  Telwares,  and 
ProfitLine. In Q1, we estimate Tango added 135 customers with 35 added organically and 100 added through the acquisitions of 
Analogous Networks and ttMobiles. Our checks with certain customers indicate a solid ROI for Tangoe’s solution and comfort given the 
company’s  size,  global  coverage,  and  investment  in  new  technology  (e.g.,  MDM).  However,  some  customers  expressed  concern 
regarding the lack of a fully integrated offering due to the numerous acquisitions though we believe these comments are tilted towards 
customers acquired mostly via acquisitions. Overall, Tangoe claims a >90% renewal rate.

Competitive Landscape 
Tangoe leads a highly fragmented TEM market with a diverse customer base and broadest offering of mobile and fixed CLM.  However, 
Tangoe faces competition in different forms, which we have segmented into three separate tiers.  The tiers are defined as follows: 
      •       Tier 1—These companies are Tangoe’s premier competitors.  These enterprises command a significant stake in the global 
            TEM market, and directly compete with Tangoe’s core revenue and can steal potential growth. 
      •       Tier 2—These companies operate on a much smaller scale than those in Tier 1.  Their main threat is that they operate in the 
            North American region, which threatens Tangoe’s core revenue. 
      •       Tier 3—Similar to Tier 2, these companies operate on a smaller scale than Tier 1.  However, their primary operations are in 
            Latin America or Europe, which is distanced from Tangoe’s core revenue, but they threaten Tangoe’s potential growth.

In the MDM market, Gartner considers Tangoe a niche challenger. While there are several strong players in enterprise MDM such as 
Mobileiron, AirWatch, Fiberlink, Zenprise, Good Technology, we believe Tangoe’s strategy in MDM is to enhance its TEM offering and 
to provide a more comprehensive CLM solution.

Financial Results and Outlook 

Recent Results 

For Q1, Tangoe reported revenue of $34.1 million, which was up 53% YoY and 17% QoQ. Driving this growth was an estimated organic 
recurring revenue growth in the low to mid-20% range and the acquisitions of Telwares, ProfitLine, Analogous, and ttMobiles. Revenue 
was driven by a 28% YoY increase of telecom expense under management to $17.6 billion and the addition of 35 new customers 
outside of M&A, which added another ~105 customers. EBITDA increased 58% YoY. Pro Forma EPS of $0.09 was up from $0.06 in Q1 
2011 and $0.08 in Q4 2011. 
For 2011, Tango reported revenue of $104.9 million, which was up 53% YoY. Driving this growth was solid organic recurring revenue 
growth and the acquisitions of ProfitLine, HCL and Telwares. Revenue was driven by a 60% YoY increase of telecom expense under 
management  to  $16.8  billion  and  the  additional  of  105  new  customers  outside  of  M&A,  which  added  another  150  customers. 
Management indicated that recurring revenue grew ~50% organically. EBITDA increased 87% YoY. Pro Forma EPS of $0.27 was up 
from $0.12 in 2010.

Q2, 2012 and LT Guidance and Outlook 

For Q2, Tangoe expects revenue of $35.0-35.5 million, up 34-36% YoY. EBITDA is expected to be $4.3-4.5 million with an EBITDA 
margin of 12.5% at the midpoint. Pro forma EPS is expected to be $0.09, up from $0.06 in Q2 2011 and flat with $0.09 in Q1. Total 
shares are expected to be 41.7 million, which includes the majority of the effect of the 2.2 million share follow on offering on April 3, 
2012, which generated $37 million of net proceeds to the company. The offering was part of a larger 8.0 million share offering, which 
included 5.8 million shares from selling stockholders. 
For 2012, Tangoe slightly increased revenue and EBITDA guidance, while lowering EPS guidance by $0.01 due to a $0.02 dilutive 
impact from its follow on offering. Management now expects revenue of $142.3-144.3 million, up 36-38% YoY. EBITDA is expected to 
be $20.2-20.7 million with an EBITDA margin of 14.3% at the midpoint. Pro forma EPS is expected to be $0.41-0.42 based on 41.3 
million shares (was 39.5 million previously). 
Long-term, management expects recurring revenue to increase to 90-92% of total revenue from 89% in 2011. Gross margin is expected 
to increase to 61-63% from 53% in 2011. EBITDA margin is expected to increase to 24-26% from 12% in 2011. The 1200-1400 basis 
point improvement in EBITDA margin is expected to be driven by the 800-1000 increase in gross margin, lower R&D and G&A spend 
on a percentage basis, and higher S&M spend on a percentage basis. 
Our estimates are in line with guidance and consensus estimate for 2012 but slightly above for 2013. Longer-term, we expect Tangoe 
to hit the lower end of its target model by 2016.

Valuation and Recommendation 

Comparative Analysis  
For comparison, we measured Tangoe against a group of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies (Figure 13). We compared 
the companies on the basis of enterprise value to sales, enterprise value to EBITDA, price-to-free cash flow, P/E and P/E to growth. 
Among Telecom Software peers, Tangoe currently trades at a discount to its mid- and large-capitalization peer group on a 2013 PEG 
basis. It trades deservedly at a premium on other metrics due to its superior growth and more predictable SaaS model. Tangoe trades 
at a discount to SaaS peers on all metrics except being inline on EV/sales.

Discounted Cash Flow 
We performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis in which we measure the sensitivity of Tangoe’s 12-month price target to different 
assumptions regarding the discount rate and terminal growth rate to our estimated 2017 year cash flow. We used 12.5% as a discount 
rate and 7% as a terminal cash flow growth rate. As a result, we arrive at an average 12-month valuation of $27. We also provide a 
range of values by varying the discount rate from 11.5% to 13.5%, and the terminal growth rate from 5% to 9%.

Valuation Summary 
We rely on our DCF analysis to arrive at a price target of $27. This represents a 42x multiple on our 2013 cash-adjusted EPS estimate. 
This is in line with our long-term EPS growth rate of 37%, which we believe may prove conservative given the company’s leadership 
position in the fast growing TEM market and likely upside to EPS estimates. 
 
Risks 
Risks to the attainment of our price target include slower adoption of TEM and MDM among enterprises, standardization of billing, 
increased competition, and integration risks with M&A strategy.

Disclosure information regarding historical ratings and price targets is available at  http://www.wedbush.com/ResearchDisclosure/DisclosureQ212.pdf 
 
Investment Rating System:   
Outperform: Expect the total return of the stock to outperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Neutral: Expect the total return of the stock to perform in-line with the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Underperform: Expect the total return of the stock to underperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) 
coverage universe over the next 6-12 months. 
 
The Investment Ratings are based on the expected performance of a stock (based on anticipated total return to price target) relative to the 
other stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe (or the analyst’s team coverage).*

The Distribution of Ratings is required by FINRA rules; however, WS’ stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and Underperform most closely 
conform to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively. Please note, however, the definitions are not the same as WS’ stock ratings are on a relative 
basis.  
 
The  analysts  responsible  for  preparing  research  reports  do  not  receive  compensation  based  on  specific  investment  banking  activity.  The 
analysts receive compensation that is based upon various factors including WS’ total revenues, a portion of which are generated by WS’ 
investment banking activities.

 Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance tweaked up                                                                 
                                                                                                             
 Tangoe delivered a modest beat on estimates at $34.1m/$0.09 vs. our 
                                                                                          Price/price relative 
 $33m/$0.07 and consensus of $33m/$0.08.  Guidance was tweaked up on 
 revenue and EBITDA, with EPS adjusted down 1c (after the 2c dilution) from                  24
 the 2.2m primary shares issued as part of the recent secondary                              20
 offering.  Integration of HCL and Telwares appear ahead of plan, which we 
 believe bodes well for Profitline.  Expense under management and new                        16
 customer adds were both healthy in the quarter and we reiterate our Buy                     12
 rating.                                                                                      8

 TNGO added 35 new customers in the quarter, higher than the typical range of                        S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)   
 20-30, we believe as a result of more salespeople from the recent acquisitions 
                                                                                         Performance (%)                             1m          3m        12m
 of ttMobiles and Anomalous Networks, both of which brought new technology 
 and the UK region.  Although the company has not increased its quarterly                Absolute -0.2        27.6               
 customer-add target, we think it is likely we will see a slightly elevation in this     S&P 500 INDEX                             -2.5           1.0           1.8
 quarterly metric.  Expense under management grew to $17.6bn, up 28% y/y      
 and 5% q/q, on the back new customer deployments.  Based on a $425bn 
 global spend estimate, TNGOs share has risen this past year from 3% to about 
 4%, still allowing for plenty of headroom for growth.  Our customer checks 
 also showed TNGO being recognized the leader in this space. 
 Margins probably have upside as migrations progress 
 The company expects to complete a majority of migrations from HCL and 
 Telwares customers (both early 2011 acquisitions) by the end of 2Q12, which 
 should help gross margins in the second half from higher automation and 
 better scale.  Profitline customers will be gradually migrated over the typical 4-
 6 quarter period.  With ttMobiles and rTEM products already richer in margin, 
 revenue mix should help aggregate margins over time.  The company 
 mentioned five rTEM wins in 1Q, a nice surprise for an acquisition that was just 
 completed in January 2012. 
 Reiterate Buy, raising PT to $26 from $25; risks 
 Our $26 price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.58 (from 
 $0.55), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.3x (slight premium to group given market 
 leadership position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 
 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
 projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing in-
 house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

1Q12 Review 

Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance tweaked up 

Tangoe delivered a modest beat on estimates at $34.1m/$0.09 vs. our $33m/$0.07 and 
consensus of $33m/$0.08.  Guidance was tweaked up on revenue and EBITDA, with 
EPS adjusted down 1c (after the 2c dilution) from the 2.2m primary shares issued as 
part of the recent secondary offering.  Integration of HCL and Telwares appear ahead of 
plan, which we believe bodes well for Profitline.  Expense under management and new 
customer adds were both healthy in the quarter and we reiterate our Buy rating. 

Key metrics: 
        Cash balance at the end of FY11 was $37.9m vs. $43.4m at the end of 4Q11. 

        Cash flow from operations was $3.5m in 1Q12 vs. 4.8m in 4Q11. 

        2Q12 guidance: Revenue of $35m-$35.5m revenue; Adj EBITDA $4.3m-$4.5m 
        and adjusted EPS of $0.09 on 41.7m shares. 

        FY12 guidance: Revenue of $142.3m-$144.3m, EBITDA $20.2m-$20.7m, 
        adjusted EPS of $0.41-$0.42 on 41.3m diluted shares.  Net effect of $0.02 
        dilution and $0.01 raise in margin profile is a $0.01 reduction vs. previous 
        guide.  Our last published model had taken this dilution into account.

Continuing to gain share 
TNGO added 35 new customer in the quarter, higher than the typical guided range of 
20-30, we believe as a result of more salespeople from the recent acquisitions of 
ttMobiles and Anomalous Networks, both of which brought new technology and the UK 
region.  While the company has not revised up its quarterly customer-add target, we 
think its likely we will see a slightly elevation in this quarterly metric.  Expense under 
management grew to $17.6bn, up 28% y/y and 5% q/q, on the back new customer 
deployments.  Based on a $425bn global spend estimate, TNGOs share has grown this 
past year from 3% to about 4%, still allowing for plenty of headroom for growth.  Our 
customer checks also showed TNGO being recognized the leader in this space. 

Figure 2 below shows the companys recent organic growth momentum.  We note that 
during FY11, the company reported $19.9m in annual inorganic contribution.  This leads 
to the computed organic rates in the 25% range.  We think the natural organic growth 
rate of the business is over 20%, with organic recurring revenue growth closer to 25%.

 Margins probably have upside as migrations progress 
 The company expects to complete a majority of migrations from HCL and Telwares 
 customers (both early 2011 acquisitions) by the end of 2Q12, which should help gross 
 margins in the second half from higher automation and better scale.  Profitline 
 customers will be gradually migrated over the typical 4-6 quarter period.  With 
 ttMobiles and rTEM products already richer in margin, revenue mix should help 
 aggregate margins over time.  The company mentioned five rTEM wins in 1Q, a nice 
 surprise for an acquisition that was just completed in December 2011.

Reiterate Buy, raising PT to $26 from $25; risks 

Our $26 price target (from $25) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.58 (from 
$0.55), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.3x (slight premium to group given market leadership 
position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 33%. Risks include 
integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new projects not ramping fast 
enough and customers taking expense processing in-house after early gains from 
Tangoe's platform.

Opinions, estimates and projections in this report constitute the current judgement of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within  the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies 
to value the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for 
"Hold" rated stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at 
http://gm.db.com to determine the target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price 
fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not 
necessarily indicative of future results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy f rom customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a 
proprietary basis.

Valuation/Risks
n  Valuation: TNGO shares trade at 5.5x 1Q12 run-rate revenues, matching the SaaS average. We see upside to its multiple over the year as investors recognize its superior
   growth opportunity and use a 7.5x multiple a year out as the basis for our $30.00 target.
n  Risks: Acquisition integration, acceptance of the SaaS model, and a limited public track record are key investment risks.

                                          Guidance upgraded for better Q1 
                                          Full year guidance has been modestly increa          sed for total revenue now in the range of 
                                          $142.3–144.3m from $141.5–143.5m and adjusted EBITDA to $20.2–20.7m from $20.0–
                                          20.5m. However, the company is now forecastin g a higher share count of 41.3m vs. 39.5m 
                                          previously due to the recent follow-on offering (which was not anticipated at the time of 
                                          original guidance), and is hence lowering the EPS guidance by 1 cent to $0.41–0.42 from 
                                          $0.42–0.43. Without the increased share count             assumption EPS guidance would have 
                                          increased by $0.02. Q2 guidance was also provided, with revenue in the range $35–35.5m 
                                          vs. consensus $34.9m, adjusted EBITDA in the range $4.3–4.5m vs. consensus $4.5m and 
                                          adjusted EPS of $0.09 vs. consensus $0.09.  

                                          Clearly, the full year guidance has been raised in-line with the extent of the Q1 surprise. This 
                                          suggests management’s outlook for the remainin g three quarters of the year is unchanged 
                                          from the previously issued guidance. Howeve r, with the positive commentary around the 
                                          health of end markets (no macro weakness i  ssues) and the international expansion that 
                                          should gain traction in the coming quarters,          we think this leaves any risk of a surprise 
                                          favoring the upside.  

                                          Overall the quarter was said to be just very good and consistent with prior quarters. Tangoe 
                                          added 35 new customers in Q1, which is ab              ove the normal 20–30 additions that the 
                                          company has historically seen. We also notice  that there was a moderate uptick in Sales & 
                                          Marketing spending, which reflects the increased hiring in quota carrying sales reps and the 
                                          support staff around those sales people. In ou r view, this shows ongoing momentum in the 
                                          business and readiness to capture the still large end market opportunity. The ASP was in-
                                          line with the historically discussed range of $150–200k, the contribution mix towards total

                                                            We believe this exemplifies Tangoe’s story of                                 being well exposed to a structural shift of 
                                                            enterprises outsourcing their Telecom Expense Management solution, which is still largely a 
                                                            greenfield opportunity and the company should be able to deliver good, consistent results 
                                                            into the medium term.

Tangoe Inc (TNGO, 08-May-2012, USD 19.30), 1-Overweight/1-Positive 
Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect  or (the "sector 
coverage universe"). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Corporate and Investmen      t Banking
Division of Barclays is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of T   angoe Inc in the
previous 12 months. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker and/or liquidity provider in securities issued by Tangoe Inc or one of  its affiliates. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from Tangoe Inc in the past 12  months. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate trades regularly in the securities of Tangoe Inc. 
Tangoe Inc is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate. 
Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $26 is based on a 2012 EV/Sales of 6.5x and revenue of $143m 
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of  the Barclays Research Price Target:  Tangoe could face increasing competition from telecom 
operators such as AT&T, especially where they have a large installed base. In addition, if IBM focused its considerable resource     s on the TEM 
market via its acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine this could be another issue. Tangoe has also been very acquisitive in its past  , and thus needs to
integrate its wide range of products. This poses execution risk since a failure to integrate products properly and loss of functionality could create
reputational damage.

the ability of the shares to perform better than the leading stock market averages or stocks within its particular industry sector.

perceived absence of strong dynamics that would cause volatility either to the upside or downside, and/or will perform less well than higher
rated companies within its peer group. Our readers should be aware that when a rating change occurs to Neutral from Buy, aggressive
trading accounts might decide to liquidate their positions to employ the funds elsewhere.

Sell - anticipates that the shares will depreciate 10% or more in price within the next 12 months, due to fundamental weakness perceived
in the company or for valuation reasons, or are expected to perform significantly worse than equities within the peer group.

 Tangoe completed its follow-on offering of 9.2m shares, of which 7m were 
                                                                                            Price/price relative 
 secondary and 2.2m primary, at $18.50 per share.  Business for the company 
 remains strong as integration of recent acquisitions is proceeding well.  We                  20
 believe the company will stay disciplined in its acquisitions as the focus shifts 
 away from scale to geographic and technology-focused assets.  We update our                   16
 model for the new primary shares and reiterate our Buy rating, raising our PT to 
                                                                                               12

 Recent acquisitions were well-chosen 
                                                                                                 7/11                                                                          1/12
 Acquisitions during 2011 were focused on gaining scale.  After the HCL and                            Tangoe, Inc.
 Telwares deals early in the year, Tangoe acquired Profitline in December 2011,                        S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)   
 gaining about $15m in annual revenue and 50 customers, including Starbucks, 
                                                                                            Performance (%)                             1m          3m        12m
 BASF, NASA, DoD and the US Postal Service, about $5m in annual revenue 
 from the government sector alone.  With almost $35m new scale related                    Absolute 5.3        28.6               
 revenue acquired through these three assets, Anomalous Networks was a                      S&P 500 INDEX                               2.5           9.1           4.9
 purely technology play followed by ttMobiles gets Tangoe about 50 customers    
  and 50 staff very familiar with the UK market.  See page 4 for a summary. 
 Estimates for FY12 leave headroom 
 Early guidance for FY12 embeds about $20m in acquired revenue, effectively 
 about 16% organic growth at the midpoint, whereas recent organic growth has 
 consistently been above 20%.  We believe this leaves adequate headroom for 
 the company to beat estimates as we progress through the year.  The process 
 of integrating acquisitions is fairly standardized at the company, but we note 
 there were five acquisitions in the past 15 months vs. only three in the years 
 prior to 2011. 
 Reiterate Buy rating, raising PT to $25 from $20 
 Our $25 price target (from $20) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of 
 $0.55 (from $0.48), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x (slight premium to group 
 given market leadership position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net 
 of dilution, of 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed 
 profitability from new projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking 
 expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

Discussion and exhibits 

Tangoe completes secondary 

Tangoe completed its follow-on offering of 9.2m shares, of which 7m were secondary 
and 2.2m were primary, at $18.50 per share.  Business for the company remains strong 
as integration of recent acquisitions is proceeding well.  We believe the company will 
stay disciplined in its acquisitions as the focus shifts away from scale to geographic and 
technology-focused assets.  We update our model for the new primary shares and 
reiterate our Buy rating, raising our PT to $25 from $20.

Progress since IPO 
Below we list significant developments since the companys IPO: 

         Tangoe went public on July 27, 2011, issuing 8.8m shares (7.5m primary) at 
         $10.  Green shoe of 1.3m secondary shares was exercised 

         Two quarters of beat-and-raise since IPO 

         Three acquisitions since going public 

         Spend under management went from about $14bn to about $17bn 

         Customer count grew from 615 to 750 

         Employee count grew from 757 to about 1,000 

         Tangoe has been positioned as a Leader in Gartners Magic Quadrant report 
         published in March 2012 

Recent acquisitions were well-chosen 
Acquisitions during 2011 were focused on gaining scale.  After the HCL and Telwares 
deals early in the year, Tangoe acquired Profitline in December 2011, gaining about 
$15m in annual revenue and 50 customers, including Starbucks, BASF, NASA, DoD and 
the US Postal Service, about $5m in annual revenue from the government sector alone.  
With almost $35m new scale related revenue acquired through these three assets, 
Anomalous Networks was a purely technology play followed by ttMobiles, which gets 
Tangoe about 50 customers  and 50 staff very familiar with the UK market.  Two 
smaller remaining players in the TEM sector are Symphony SMS (part of Symphony 
Service Corp, an outsourcing vendor) and Rivermine, now part of IBM after its 
acquisition of Emptoris.

 Estimates for FY12 leave headroom 
 Early guidance for FY12 embeds about $20m in acquired revenue, effectively about 16% 
 organic growth at the midpoint, whereas recent organic growth has consistently been 
 above 20%.  We believe this leaves adequate headroom for the company to beat 
 estimates as we progress through the year.  The process of integrating acquisitions is 
 fairly standardized at the company, but we note there were five acquisitions in the past 
 15 months vs. only three in the years prior to 2011. 

 Customers from the HCL and Telwares acquisitions are beginning to be migrated after 
 the businesses themselves were integrated into Tangoe.  With over half of Tangoes 
 staff in customer-facing roles, we expect customer migration to be fairly smooth, but 
 like with other software migrations, the process can often depend on the needs and 
 internal processes at the individual customers.  Profitline customers are more likely to 
 be migrated next year, as its still early days since the acquisition.  

 Figure 4 below shows the organic growth profile of the company since 2008.  Inorganic 
 contribution in FY11 was $19.9m and the companys guidance for FY12 embeds about 
 $20m in acquired revenue, about $14.5m from Profitline, $1m from Anomalous 
 Networks and $4.5m from ttMobiles.

Figure 4 plots organic growth for total revenue and recurring revenue.  We note that the 
company doesnt disclose organic recurring revenue separately.  We assume that of the 
$19.9m in total inorganic revenue in FY11, about $17.5m was recurring, with the rest in 
consulting or professional services.

 Reiterate Buy rating, raising PT to $25 from $20 

 Our $25 price target (from $20) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.55 (from 
 $0.48), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of 
 dilution, of 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
 projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing in-house 
 after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or otherwise, in a manner inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including 
strategists and sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this report constitute the current judgement of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within  the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies 
to value the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for 
"Hold" rated stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at 
http://gm.db.com to determine the target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price 
fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not 
necessarily indicative of future results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy f rom customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a 
proprietary basis.

                                           Executive Summary
                                           Having  consolidated  a  significant  number  of  smaller  competitors,  and  expanded  its  suite
                                           of offerings via both internal development and strategic acquisitions in fixed and wireless
                                           Telecommunications  Expense  Management  (TEM)  and  in  Mobile  Device  Management
                                           (MDM), Tangoe has become a one stop Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM)
                                           provider.  In  our  view,  as  a  SaaS  sector  dominator,  in  an  attractive  and  large  space,
                                           the companys accelerated revenue and earnings growth, combined with its recurring and
                                           predictable financial model, create a compelling investment that should outperform the broader
                                           market. Against this backdrop, we are initiating coverage of Tangoe with a Buy rating and
                                           $30.00 target price. We see the shares as a solid core holding for growth-oriented investors.

                                           Key Investment Highlights

                                           Leader in SaaS tools for very large market. Tangoe is well established as the leading
                                           global SaaS provider of Telecom Expense Management (TEM) solutions for enterprise and
                                           mid-market companies. Having moved from fixed-line and datacom-centric solutions into the
                                           wireless expense management arena, Tangoe more recently broadened to also manage end-user
                                           devices in the mobile world, an emerging segment termed Mobile Device Management (MDM).
                                           In our view, Tangoes tools can be marketed to virtually any Global 5000 enterprise customer,
                                           and to the bulk of the global mid-market to create a very large market opportunity with only
                                           minimal penetration to date. With Tangoe currently the largest scaled vendor while still serving
                                           only roughly 700 customers, we see the space as a true "multi-billion dollar" opportunity long-
                                           term. The competitive environment is largely addressed currently by small regional service
                                           providers with manually-intensive business models as contrasted to Tangoe's highly automated
                                           processes.

                                           Proven cost cutter for customers, with control improvements also. Tangoes TEM solutions
                                           are designed to rapidly discover cost savings for customers, from reducing unused lines to
                                           improving rate plan selection. With systems in place, customers also gain greater control over
                                           service usage, end-user devices and applications to bolster its overall value-add. More recent
                                           capabilities even allow for real-time spend management optimization to avoid problems such
                                           as sudden usage spikes or unplanned international service requirements that previously might
                                           have resulted in large (but avoidable) billing increases.

                                           Highly  visible,  recurring  revenue  model.  As  a  SaaS-based  revenue  model  (albeit  with
                                           professional services as a natural component of revenues), the volatility of quarterly licensing
                                           revenues of legacy software providers has been replaced by a highly predictable revenue and
                                           earnings model. Long-term, we believe overall predictability should prove to be strong and
                                           supportive of a premium valuation versus growth-oriented companies who typically lack such
                                           visibility.

                                           Solid organic growth rate and proven acquisition history. Despite intense macroeconomic
                                           pressures, Tangoes revenues grew organically over 20% in both 2010 and 2011. Tangoe has
                                           also executed a clear "roll-up" strategy in its core TEM space by applying its technology-driven
                                           solutions to competitors' manual-centric business models. With 4Q11 reported revenue growth
                                           of 56.6% attesting to the scaling benefits of these efforts, we believe this strategy warrants
                                           a premium valuation for Tangoe, particularly in light of the consistently accretive outcomes
                                           demonstrated.

                                           Scaling profitability with deleveraged balance sheet post IPO. With adjusted EBITDA
                                           forecast to increase nearly 3x from 2010 to 2012 (to $20.2 million in 2012 versus $6.9 million in
                                           2010), Tangoe is solidly profitable and on the cusp of an earnings breakout, in our view. With an
                                           acquisitive history, the balance sheet was moderately leveraged pre-IPO, but IPO and follow-
                                           on proceeds have cut debt roughly 50% to $16.2 million versus cash reserves now estimated at
                                           $81.3 million to yield roughly $1.60 in net cash per share.

Tangoe, Inc.                                                                                                              April 5, 2012

                                           Valuation Framework

                                           Primary near-term factor is expected revenue multiple expansion. We view Tangoe as
                                           having category killer status in the TEM market, and as a solid player in the fast emerging
                                           MDM space. With solid profitability and organic growth well established, we believe the
                                           company should become a premium player in terms of valuation in the SaaS space, although
                                           a limited track record has likely gated this move somewhat. In our view, its ability to augment
                                           solid organic growth with a well-defined and proven accretive acquisition strategy should
                                           garner a premium valuation. Currently trading at roughly 5.9x run-rate revenues (net of net
                                           cash), matching its peer average of 5.9x, investors willing to buy early and hold through the
                                           development of a solid guidance and execution history could be well rewarded by sharply higher
                                           valuation multiples on an increasing revenue base over time. Our price target of $30.00 assumes
                                           a 7.5x run-rate revenues multiple (arguing for a 25% premium for its accretive acquisition
                                           strategy) applied to our 4Q12 forecast and adds an estimated net cash reserve adjustment.

                                           Too early to focus on EPS, but does offer defensibility, in our view. While we view it as
                                           too early to focus on an earnings-driven valuation given its accelerated organic growth phase
                                           and only early-stage overall profitability (operating margins in 4Q11 were just 4.1% but did
                                           increase over 250 basis points year over year), pro forma EPS can be used, in our view, as a
                                           backstop in terms of valuation defensibility. Run-rate pro forma EPS in 4Q11 were $0.32, to
                                           yield an implied pro forma P/E (net of cash reserves of roughly $1.60 per share) of roughly 53x,
                                           essentially inline with the 57% revenue growth rate reported for 4Q11. As we typically apply a
                                           1.5 PEG to account for superior predictability in the SaaS space, the "core P/E multiple" (pre-
                                           PEG) could be implied at 35x. With pro forma EPS up over 100% in 2011 (to $0.26 versus $0.12
                                           in 2010 if using a normalized sharecount to improve the comparisons' fairness), the multiples
                                           (pre-PEG or not) are defensible in our view. Perhaps more importantly, looking forward, our
                                           4Q12 run-rate pro forma EPS forecast of $0.56 would imply a P/E of roughly 30x (or 20x with
                                           a PEG of 1.5x) at current trading levels, a well defensible multiple in our view.

                                           Tangoe, Inc. (TNGO) was founded in 2000 and is based in Orange, Connecticut. Venture-
                                           backed by Edison Ventures, Sevin Rosen Funds, Investor Growth Capital and North Atlantic
                                           Capital, Tangoe is the leading global provider of SaaS-based telecommunications expense
                                           management (TEM) solutions that help enterprise and mid-market customers lower their costs
                                           and increase the controls over their telecommunications and data communications assets,
                                           in both fixed-line and wireless environments. With the proliferation of intelligent wireless
                                           devices increasing the complexity of supporting wireless deployments, Tangoe has extended
                                           its solutions to also address Mobile Device Management (MDM), to create an end-to-end
                                           solution suite for Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM). Today, Tangoe has run-rate
                                           revenues of roughly $117 million and more than 800 employees supporting over 700 customers
                                           worldwide. End customer spending managed by its systems totals over $15 billion and over 2
                                           million end-user wireless devices are managed by its applications.

                                           Complex  problems  underserved  by  manual  outsourcing  players.  The  complexity  of
                                           administering  to  telecommunications  spending  should  not  be  underestimated.  Looked  at
                                           simply, even a company with as few as 500 "white collar" employees could be forced to
                                           deal with as many as 15,000-20,000 bills per year (assuming each is billed monthly for one
                                           desk phone, one mobile phone and one data connection for a total of up to 36 bills per
                                           year each). With rate and billing complexity for telecommunications exacerbated by issues
                                           related to volumes (with time of day and seasonal variations for example) and geographies
                                           (international currencies and languages and rates varying greatly versus domestic geographies)

Tangoe, Inc.                                                                                                                April 5, 2012

                                            and even technologies (compatibility-driven or even user-driven such as applet downloading
                                            and billing), and multiplied by the number of vendors chosen globally, the manual approach to
                                            billing outsourcing employed by many companies leaves most issues unaddressed. In manual
                                            outsourcing situations, business partners typically aggregate only basic datasets to forward to
                                            payables departments, leaving optimization efforts largely unsupported.

                                            Automation is key to success in TEM. In Tangoe's case, it has deployed a global infrastructure
                                            (with 88 global invoice processing centers covering over 180 countries) that is capable not only
                                            of capturing and integrating raw digital billing feeds (as would be expected perhaps in most
                                            "G20"-type countries), but also of efficiently converting paper-based bills into digital feeds by
                                            using automated optical conversion technologies. This infrastructure investment leaves Tangoe
                                            uniquely capable of preserving and using virtually all billing data within its SaaS-based analytic
                                            engine for future billing and vendor optimization and selection efforts.

                                            In terms of scale, we note that Tangoe processes roughly 500,000 invoices monthly on behalf
                                            of its customers (in 16 languages and more than 125 currencies currently). With challenges
                                            exacerbated by the need to support over 60 global regulatory agencies, we beleive the barriers
                                            to building a truly global telecommunications expense management engine to compete with
                                            Tangoe are extremely high.

                                            Very large end-market should see strong adoption given high ROI. From a target market
                                            perspective, while Tangoe derives the bulk of its revenues from large enterprises (roughly 50%
                                            of revenues come from its top 100 customers who are typically Global 2000 enterprises, it also
                                            services the global mid-market. In our view, the Global 5000 should virtually all be strong target
                                            customers (with telecom/datacom a nearly ubiquitous requirement for modern companies to
                                            compete in the global market) as should mid-market companies (which we see totaling several
                                            hundred thousand companies as we estimate as many as 250,000 companies have, for example,
                                            adopted mid-market ERP solutions over the past two decades). Overall, while impossible to
                                            accurately gauge, we are confident that Tangoe's end market represents a true "multi-billion
                                            dollar" market opportunity. To support this claim we note that average revenues per customer
                                            tend to be much higher than in most SaaS verticals, with its Top 35 customers averaging more
                                            than $1.0 million per year and its Top 100 averaging roughly $600,000. Its overall average
                                            revenue per customer is in the $150,000-$200,000 range to leave even moderate penetration
                                            of the global enterprise and mid-markets capable of driving billions in annual revenues over
                                            the long-term.

                                            From an ROI perspective, the company notes that its ability to cut costs (by improving rate
                                            plans and eliminating unused telecom/datacom lines, for example) can in many cases result in
                                            payback periods of six months or less, an analysis we see supported by its very high customer
                                            retention level (at above 95% annually to come in at the upper-end of all SaaS players). We
                                            believe the ubiquity of telecom/datacom usage globally, tied to its strong customer ROI argues
                                            not only for a large market, but for a strong likelihood of high customer adoption rates long-
                                            term.

                                            Mobile  Device  Management  offers  complementary  offering  to  core  telecom  expense
                                            management. With wireless devices becoming ever "smarter," they are also becoming more
                                            difficult to administer to for corporations. While "dumb mobile phones" could largely be treated
                                            the same as fixed telecom lines, phones that can now download fee-based applications (and even
                                            viruses) offer unique new management problems for both technical and financial optimization.
                                            With its 2008 acquisition of privately-held Telwares, Tangoe moved into the Mobile Device
                                            Management (MDM) space. While we view this space as highly fragmented and competitive
                                            (with many private and public companies looking to compete in it today), we see Tangoe's
                                            unique ability to bridge between billing data and device control as a clear advantage. We view
                                            this as an upside market (and financial) opportunity currently, with its TEM space primarily

                                            Financial Model - Factors & Forecasts

                                            Factors

                                            Key factors driving Tangoe's financial model are as follows.

                                            1. Recurring revenue-driven. As a subscription-oriented revenue model, as opposed to the
                                            former licensing model that dominated the software industry for decades, Tangoes revenues
                                            (and in turn earnings) have high predictability and stability, with a strong, sequential-growth
                                            bias. While its services and consulting revenues are not recurring, they represented only 11% of
                                            2011 total revenues to minimize their volatizing impact. This recurring revenue model supports
                                            a strong tendency to achieve record revenues both annually and sequentially (our model notes
                                            no sequentially lower quarters dating back to at least 2008; prior years dating back to 2005 also
                                            carry unbroken year over year growth). We see no factors likely to change this pattern going
                                            forward and note that no customers represent a material portion of revenues.

                                            2. Organic growth augmented by acquisitions. While not immune to the recessions impacts,
                                            Tangoe continued to report solid organic growth of more than 20% in each of the past two years.
                                            In addition, Tangoe has been a serial acquirer of both competing companies and complementary
                                            product offerings. While at times strategic product acquisitions could prove to add minimally
                                            to revenues and/or earnings (or could potetnially even prove mildly dilutive), the company's
                                            competitive acquisitions fit a clear "roll-up" strategy by being rapidly accretive. Tangoe has
                                            a solid global foundation built upon highly automated business processes (such as optical
                                            scanning of paper-based bills in international geographies) and advanced software engines to
                                            provide its services. While its competitors continue to rely on manually-intensive data entry and
                                            analysis methods, Tangoe can typically increase the profitability of its acquisitions both rapidly
                                            and materially. As such, we would expect (and hope) to see a continuation of its roll-up strategy
                                            both domestically (its primary focus to date) and internationally (noting its recent U.K.-based
                                            acquisition of ttMobiles in February 2012). In our view, the faster Tangoe can identify and
                                            complete these types of acquisitions the better as they should offer steady upside to base-line
                                            forecasts which cannot anticipate the timing and impact of the accretion that would be expected.

                                            3. Gross margins below SaaS peers but should trend higher on steady-state basis. Blended
                                            gross margins in 4Q11 were 53%, a level well below many pure-play SaaS players in other
                                            vertical markets. The global infrastructure Tangoe has deployed to enable the ability to capture
                                            and digitize telecom bills across the world (regardless of language and currency) offers a cost
                                            to operations that is well above that of many SaaS-based models. However, it also offers large
                                            competitive barriers to entry and scale. Long-term, as Tangoe scales from the current "hundreds
                                            of customers" scale (over 700 now) to the thousands, we expect steady increases to overall
                                            gross margins and profitability on a steady-state basis (once acquisitions are fully integrated
                                            and optimized to augment organic growth). Periodically however, we note that acquisitions
                                            will likely result in dampened near-term gross margins prior to integration and optimization.

                                            4. Earnings poised for solid growth. With revenues setting consistent record highs, and
                                            growth (organic and acquisition-driven) remaining at a highly accelerated pace (4Q11 revenues
                                            were up 56.6%), pro forma earnings have demonstrated a strong "stair step" pattern over the past
                                            few years (adjusted net income has risen sequentially every quarter since 4Q08). In aggregate,
                                            adjusted net income scaled over 100% in 2011 to $8.8 million versus $3.5 million in 2010, or
                                            to $0.26 per share in 2011 versus roughly $0.12 in 2010 (using a "normalized" sharecount to
                                            improve comparisons pre-IPO). Our $0.42 pro forma EPS forecast for 2012 would still offer
                                            greater than 60% upside versus 2011.

                                            Forecasts
                                            2012

                                            Combining the above factors, we are forecasting record 2012 revenues of $142.3 million, up
                                            35.6% year-over-year, to drive record pro forma EPS of $0.42 (up 60% versus the prior record
                                            of $0.26 in 2011). By contrast to the unbroken sequential adjusted net income pattern that dates
                                            back to 2008, our model presumes a one quarter narrow de-leveraging (modeled essentially
                                            flat at $2.96 million in 1Q12 versus $3.02 million in 4Q11) as a result of early year spending
                                            and acquisition impacts, although we would not be greatly surprised to see upside ot our model
                                            result in another sequentially higher quarter. This forecast leaves pro forma EPS estimated flat
                                            sequentially at $0.08 for 1Q12 before returning to a sequential growth pattern thereafter (up
                                            $0.01 sequentially in 2Q12 to $0.09, $0.02 higher in 3Q12 to $0.11 and $0.03 higher in 4Q12
                                            to $0.14) to leave run-rate pro forma EPS of $0.56 exiting the year.

                                            2013
                                            Looking out to 2013, we are forecasting record revenues of $170.0 million, up 19.5% year-
                                            over-year, to drive pro forma EPS of $0.58. With no ability to know if/when strategic or
                                            complementary acquisitions are timed, we simply focus on the development of a steady-state
                                            model to leave its accretive acquisition roll-up strategy as an (expected) upside driver. As
                                            a steady-state model, we assume recurring revenues grow 20%, but model services grow
                                            at a slower 15% rate. We see gross margins trending slowly higher, forecast at 54.9% for
                                            2013 versus the 53.5% we forecast for 2012. In terms of fairness as forecasts, we note that
                                            gross margins have been as high as 56.3% in 2010 prior to certain investment and acquisition
                                            dampeners. Again, given a solidly sequentially higher earnings bias, we view run-rate pro forma
                                            EPS as more important that actual annual forecasts and note that our 4Q13 forecast results in a
                                            run-rate earnings level of $0.64 per share. From an upside perspective, with only minor organic
                                            and acquisition-driven upside over the next 12-18 months, we believe run-rate pro forma EPS
                                            could actually scale well higher, with for example, only $1.6 million in quarterly adjusted net
                                            income upside required to drive run-rate pro forma EPS to as high as $0.80 exiting 4Q12.

                                            Balance Sheet Solid

                                            Tangoe's balance sheet is solid. With adjusted EBITDA forecast to increase over 2.5x from
                                            2010 to 2012 (to $20.2 million in 2012 versus $6.9 million in 2010), Tangoe is solidly profitable
                                            to leave its balance sheet an asset largely available for continued strategic and complementary
                                            acquisitions as has been a long-term focus for the company. The balance sheet was moderately
                                            leveraged pre-IPO, with debt totaling $29.7 million versus cash of $9.0 million in 2Q11. Post
                                            IPO, debt was cut strongly (to $7.3 million exiting 3Q11) but has rebounded moderately as
                                            a result of continued acquisitions to exit 4Q11 at $16.2 million. However, total cash has also
                                            stepped up strongly as an offset, exiting 4Q11 at $43.4 million (including IPO and core cash
                                            generation impacts) and is set to increase to roughly $81 million as a result of its recent follow-
                                            on offering (in which the company sold 2.2 million shares of an 8.0 million share offering).

                                            In our view, with a proven "roll-up" strategy in place, we would expect to see ongoing
                                            acquisitions completed, backed up by sporadic forays into the capital markets to replenish
                                            deployed capital. So long as its acquisitions remain largely focused on buying competing
                                            vendors  in  an  accretive  manner  (with  less  focus  on  strategic  and  potentially  dilutive
                                            acquisitions), we would strenuously support such efforts as a strong avenue to continue to
                                            accelerate its scale and earnings development pace while simultaneously building even greater
                                            barriers to entry.

Valuation/Risks
n  Valuation: TNGO shares trade at 6x 4Q11 run-rate revenues, matching the SaaS average. We see potential upside to its multiple over the year as investors recognize its
   superior growth opportunity and use a 7.5x multiple a year out as the basis for our $30.00 target.
n  Risks: Acquisition integration, acceptance of the SaaS model, and a limited public track record are key investment risks.

Chasing the Wolfbone Play in Delaware Basin, Texas

The Permian Basin is going through a drilling renaissance. We watched the Midland Basin Wolfcamp Shale play unfold in the last 18
months and we are turning our attention to the Delaware Basin, to an equally high potential trend: the Wolfbone Play in eastern Reeves
County. This play is tightly held and the first movers are: J. Cleo Thompson (private), Clayton Williams Energy Inc. (CWEI-$79.26,
Buy), Comstock Resources (CRK-NR), Eagle Oil and Gas (private), Atlantic Operating Company (private), Patriot Resources (private)
and Concho Resources (CXO-$102.81, Buy). In addition to Reeves County, Pecos County could have Wolfbone potential. Moving toward
the north central parts of Reeves County and spilling into Ward County, producers such as Energen Corp. (EGN-NR) are pursuing a
highly prospective and overpressured 3rd Bone Spring Sand. There are many ways to slice and dice the Delaware Basin and we expect
to have a more granular view of the various plays as 2012 unfolds.

Initiating Coverage With a Buy; Best Telecom Expense Management Dance Partner

We are initiating coverage of Tangoe, Inc. (TNGO) with a Buy rating and $30.00 target price. Having consolidated a significant number
of  competitors  and  expanded  its  suite  of  offerings  via  both  internal  development  and  strategic  acquisitions  in  fixed  and  wireless
Telecommunications  Expense  Management  (TEM)  and  in  Mobile  Device  Management  (MDM),  Tangoe  has  become  a  one  stop
Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM) provider. In our view, as a sector dominator, the companys accelerated revenue and
earnings growth, combined with its recurring and predictable financial model, create a compelling investment that should outperform the
broader market.

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $21 price target for Tangoe by applying a roughly 4.5x EV/S multiple to our FY13E revenue of $169.2M. We note the
  SaaS peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' revenue. We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a
  deep  technological  SaaS  foundation,  the  "stickiness"  of  its  installed  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,
  subscriptions model), its robust growth rates, market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its
  model, Tangoe should trade more in line with its peers.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.

       Anomalous Networks acquisition brings key technology 
       Tangoes $3.5m acquisition of Anomalous Networks brings key new functionality 
       of real-time TEM (rTEM) that allows users  to be alerted to potential bill-shock 
       before it happens.  Tangoes traditional pr  oducts havent been able to do that, 
       except through the mobile device mana gement product that might simply block 
       usage of the device based on certain ru         les.  rTEM software installed on each 
       device and monitored centrally can alert  users as they approach their voice/data 
       limits, a particularly useful enhancement in the era of smartphones and tiered data 
       plans.  
       Reiterate Buy    , raising PT to $20 from $18; risks       
       We adjust our estimates for FY12-13 based on guidance (see summary of 
       estimate changes on page 3).  Our $20 price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share 
       estimate of $0.51 (from $0.48), an EV/uFCF/ G multiple of 1.2x (slight premium to 
       the group for market leadership), and an   estimated five-year growth rate, net of 
       dilution, of 30%. Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
       profitability from new projects not ramp        ing fast enough and customers taking 
       expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

                                4Q Review 

                                Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance leaves headroom 

                                Tangoe reported 4Q11 revenue/EPS of $29.2m/$0.  08 vs. our/consensus of $28.1m/$0.07.  
                                Adjusting for one-time and in  organic contribution, the effe ctive revenue beat was about 
                                $550k, equating to organic revenue growth of 26% y/y, about 27% on recurring revenue.  
                                FY12 guidance of $138m at the midpoint implies 14% organic growth, we believe leaving 
                                room for outperformance as recent momentum points to >20% organic growth.  We 
                                reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $20 from $18. 

                                Key metrics: 
                                     Cash balance at the end of FY11 was $43.4m vs. $52.5m at the end of 3Q11.  $14m was 
                                     paid out for the Profitline acquisition. 
                                     Cash flow from operations was $4.8m in       4Q11 vs. $1.2m  in   4Q10 and $1.7m last 
                                     quarter. 
                                     1Q12 Guidance: Revenue of $32.2m to $        32.7m and EPS of $0.08 vs. our previous 
                                     estimate of $32.8m/$0.09 and consensus of $31.6m/$0.08.  
                                     FY12 revenue guidance of $137m-$139m         and EPS of $0.41-$0.42 vs. our previous 
                                     estimate $137m/$0.39 and consensus of $135.5m/$0.41

                                Business continues to expand with portfolio 
                                The combination of Tangoes organic growth as well as new customers and channels that 
                                came with acquisitions is allowing the company to expand its market presence.  About 2/3 of 
                                direct sales are from new customers, with the remaining third up-sell into the existing 
                                customer base.  Channel contribution has grown to about a quarter of new bookings.  
                                Profitline brought Tangoe into the important  government vertical and a channel partnership 
                                with SAIC.  Telecom expense under manageme nt grew to $16.8bn, up 20% since the mid-
                                2011 IPO and 60% over FY10, helped by the acquisition of HCL and Telwares early in 2011.  
                                With European presence growing and planned         expansion in APAC this year, we believe 
                                Tangoe will begin to have a well-diversified revenue base over the next 2-3 years. 

                                Figure 2 below shows the companys recent or       ganic growth momentum.  We note that 
                                during FY11, our estimates for contribution from  HCL and Telwares ($17 in total) could have 
                                been lower than the actual results.  This lead s to the computed organic rates in the 26-30% 
                                range, 26% in the most recent quarter, being optically inflated and suggesting a slowdown in 
                                FY12, based on conservative guidance of 14%  (implied) organic growth.  HCL and Telwares 
                                both anniversary during 1Q12, wi th roughly $2.7m residual contri bution in the quarter.  We 
                                think the natural organi c growth rate of the business is   over 20%, with organic recurring

                                        Anomalous Networks acquisition brings key technology 
                                        Tangoes $3.5m acquisition of Anomalous Networks brings key new functionality of real-time 
                                        TEM (rTEM) that allows users to be alerted to                 potential bill-shock before it happens.  
                                        Tangoes traditional products havent been able to  do that, except through the mobile device 
                                        management product that might simply block usag  e of the device based on certain rules.  
                                        rTEM software installed on ea  ch device and monitored cent  rally can alert users as they 
                                        approach their voice/data limits, a particularly  useful enhancement in the era of smartphones 
                                        and tiered data plans.

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

                                   Commentary & Analysis

                                   We are raising our price target to $20 from $17 on the heels of a solid 4Q11, led by healthy recurring
                                   revenue  growth  (+61%  Y/Y)  and  new  customer  wins.  Tangoe  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide
                                   fixed/mobile communications spend (manages $16.8B of the ~$425B TAM, or total available market),
                                   and recent acquisitions of ProfitLine (on 12/19) and Anomalous Networks (on 1/10) broaden Tangoe's
                                   communications  lifecycle  management  portfolio,  increase  scale,  and  present  additional  up/cross-sell
                                   opportunities. We believe Tangoe can continue to deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth through a
                                   variety of drivers (e.g., greenfield opportunities, penetrate existing customers, international expansion,
                                   leverage  in  the  model,  deepen  alliances,  proliferation  of  mobile  devices)  for  the  foreseeable  future.
                                   Given these solid fundamentals and an attractive valuation (~3.8x CY13E rev.), we remain buyers.

                                   Tangoe reported 4Q11 non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.08/$29.2M, topping its guidance and
                                   our  $0.07/$28.3M  forecast,  with  strength  across  the  board. Tangoe  posted  recurring  revenue  of
                                   $25.8M (up 61.3% Y/Y), and services revenue grew a healthy 28.5% Y/Y to $3.5M (we note services
                                   revenue  included  $250K  of  one-time,  non-recurring  revenue).  We  are  pleased  to  see  the  company
                                   deliver another quarter of mid-twenties organic recurring revenue growth and retention rates remain in
                                   the mid-90 percent range.

                                   Tangoe closed 22 new customers during the quarter (vs. 25 new logos last quarter) and continues to
                                   displace  competitors  and  home-grown  systems.  We  note  that  Tangoe  typically  signs  between  20-30
                                   new customers a quarter. While the new customer count was lower than last quarter's, management
                                   notes  that  the  average  transaction  size  was  almost  25%  larger).  It  is  clear  to  us  that  Tangoe  is
                                   executing  on  its  plan  to  increasingly  drive  CLM  spend  through  its  platform,  with  total  spend  under
                                   management  now  at  $16.8B,  up  60%  (and  up  54%  ex-ProfitLine).  Given  low  penetration  rates  at
                                   existing  customers  (~33%  penetrated)  and  a  large  greenfield  opportunity  (~80%  of  companies  use
                                   home  grown  systems),  we  expect  Tangoe  to  continue  driving  spend  through  its  platform  for  the
                                   foreseeable future.

                                   Consolidating the space. Tangoe is proving to be a skilled consolidator, and we believe M&A is one
                                   of the company's core competencies (Tangoe acquired seven companies over the past five years). As
                                   a  reminder,  Tangoe  acquired  ProfitLine  on  12/19/2011.  One  of  the  largest  CLM  vendors  behind
                                   Tangoe,  ProfitLine  provides  scale  and  entry  into  the  Federal  vertical  market  (25%  of  ProfitLine's
                                   business is gov't). ProfitLine operates in both the fixed and mobile space, and the vast majority of the
                                   company's 50 customers did not use both products. Further, ProfitLine was primarily US-focused. We
                                   believe  Tangoe  has  a  large  opportunity  to  up/cross  sell  additional  modules  as  well  as  penetrate
                                   international  CLM  spend  at  legacy  ProfitLine  customers.  Last,  ProfitLine  brings  healthy  partnerships
                                   with HP and SAIC (system  integrators).  Recall  strategic  alliances  are  a  key  component  of  Tangoe's
                                   go-to-market strategy, as they contribute about 25% of new annual recurring revenue (Tangoe also has
                                   alliances  with IBM, Dell, HPQ, and Xerox).  ProfitLine  contributed  about  $500K  in  revenues  during
                                   4Q11 and is expected to bring in $14-15M during FY12.

                                   Tangoe  on  1/10/2012  acquired  Anomalous  Networks,  a  leading  provider  of  real-time  TEM  (rTEM)
                                   solutions.  Unlike  Tangoe's  legacy  CLM  solutions  that  monitor  telecom  expense  compliance  upon  bill
                                   receipt,   Anomalous'   rTEM   technology   monitors   mobile   device   activity   at   the   "actual   point   of
                                   consumption" to proactively management telecom expenses and reduce "bill shock." In other words,
                                   the real-time nature of rTEM enables companies to provide enhanced visibility into telecom spend and
                                   better manage its communications assets. While we do not expect significant revenue contribution from
                                   rTEM this year (~$1M in revenue), we believe rTEM is an emerging technology that is complementary
                                   with Tangoe's CLM portfolio and provides up/cross-sell opportunities, over time.

                                   Leverage in the model. The integration of HCL and Telwares (both acquired during 1Q11) is well on
                                   track. Recall that HCL/Telwares operated at lower gross margins than Tangoe, which have served as a
                                   short-term  drag  to  overall  margins  (gross  margin  dropped  to  52.9%  at  4Q11  from  57%  at  4Q10  --
                                   management notes gross margin ex-HCL/Telwares would have been higher in 4Q11 than in 4Q10). It

typically takes Tangoe 12-18 months to fully transition acquired clients to its CLM platform (from the

acquired platform), and we expect HCL/Telwares to be no different. During 4Q11, Tangoe ramped up

its customer migrations which should be completed over the next few quarters. As a result, we expect

gradual   margin   expansion   over   the   course   of   this   year   (despite   the   ProfitLine   acquisition)   and

anticipate  Tangoe  to  successfully  up/cross-sell  legacy  HCL/Telwares  customers  upon  migration.  We

think management's goal of 55% gross margin at the end of FY12 is quite achievable.

Regarding  the  macro  environment, management  highlighted  it  has  not  seen  any  impact  to  its

business  from  macro  headwinds  and  notes  its  pipelines  remain  healthy.  We  believe  Tangoe  is

relatively insulated, should the macro environment further deteriorate since: 1) Tangoe's contracts are

longer-term (while contracts range from 2-5 years, the typical contract runs 2-3 years); and 2) Tangoe's

TEM  and  MDM  solutions  drive  ROI,  improve  efficiencies,  and  reduce  compliance/regulatory/security

risks,  all  of  which  provide  an  additional  layer  of  "stickiness"  (ie,  loyalty/reluctance  to  switch).  As  a

reminder, Tangoe delivered >20% organic recurring revenue growth during the '08/09 recession.

Altogether,  we  continue  to  believe  the  CLM  market  is  still  in  its  earliest  stages  of  growth,  as

enterprises are just beginning to address the need to centrally manage a disparate inventory of fixed

and  mobile  assets.  This  segment  should  only  increase  in  importance  as  enterprises  connect  mobile

devices  (smartphones,  tablets)  to  the  corporate  network  at  an  accelerating  pace.  As  a  result  of  this

growing  complexity,  we  believe  companies  will  begin  to  move  off  outdated,  home-grown  systems  to

effectively manage telecom resources. Given Tangoe's leadership position in the CLM space (Tangoe

is more than three times larger than its nearest competitor and is the only player to combine TEM/MDM

in  one  solution)  and  a  healthy  moat  (ie,  barriers  to  entryTangoe's  CLM  solution  supports  16

languages, 125 currencies, 200 countries/territories, 1,900 billing formats, 1,700 carriers globally, and

opportunity and deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth for the foreseeable future.

Tangoe's Revised Outlook

Tangoe introduces 1Q12 and FY12 estimates. For 1Q12, Tangoe expects EPS of $0.08 on revenue

of $32.2-32.7M. Tangoe also guides 1Q12 Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5-3.7M, taxes of $200K, and 39M

shares outstanding.

For FY12, Tangoe expects EPS of $0.41-0.42 on revenue of $137-139M. Tangoe also guides FY12

Adjusted EBITDA of $19.5-20M, taxes of $1M, and 39.5M shares outstanding. Management expects

FY gross margin to be 55% for the FY, with lower margins in the first half of the year and increasing as

the year progresses.

Changes to our Model

Following TNGO's solid 4Q11 results and revised outlook, we've adjusted our model. We now

expect FY12 EPS/revenue of $0.41/$138.6M vs. our prior estimate of $0.43/$135.5M and consensus of

$0.41/$135.5M.    We    also    introduce    FY13    EPS/revenue    of    $0.59/$164.2M    vs.    consensus    of

$0.54/$152.7M. A more detailed breakout of our model changes is contained in the exhibit below:

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $20 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.5x EV/S multiple to our FY13E revenue of $164.2M. We note the SaaS peer
  group  has  historically  traded  at  5-7x  next-12-months'  revenue.  We  contend  that  since  TNGO's  CLM  solution  is  based  on  a  deep
  technological  SaaS  foundation,  the  "stickiness"  of  its  installed  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,
  subscriptions model), its robust growth rates (40% five-year CAGR), market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the
  sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with its peers.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.

                                             Changes to our Estimates

                                             We've  adjusted  our  model  following  TNGO's  acquisition  of  ProfitLine. We  have  increased  our

                                             CY11E revenue forecast by $400K to $104.0 million but left our EPS unchanged at $0.25. For FY12,

                                             we   have   increased   our   revenue   forecast   by   $14.2   million   to   $135.5   million   to   account   for   the

                                             contribution  of  ProfitLine.  Although  we  believe  ProfitLine  will  be  slightly  dilutive  to  TNGO's  gross

                                             margins   in   2012,   we   expect   TNGO   to   achieve   operational   synergies   (elimination   of   redundant

                                             positions) and for the deal to be modestly accretive next year. Thus, we have increased our 2012 EPS

                                             by a penny to $0.40. For a closer view of our other changes, please see the exhibit below:

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $17 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.6x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $124.0M. We note the SaaS
  peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (its
  MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to SaaS architecture by end of
  next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the "stickiness" of its installed
  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,  subscriptions  model),  its  robust  growth  rates  (40%  five-year  CAGR),
  market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with
  its peers, which leads us to our $17 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.

       Tangoe announced the acquisition of Profitline, for $23.5m, ~1.6x CY12 rev. This is                    11
       its 3rd acquisition this year, after acquiring HCL's TEM business and Telwares                          9
       early in 2011.  The acquisition will bri  ng ~$14m-$15m in 2012 revenues. Tangoe                        8
       expects slight accretion as customers are  migrated gradually to  its platform over                       7/11
       the next 12-18 months. With a good track record of integrating acquisitions, we                                  Tangoe, Inc.
       think this move will improve Tangoe's sc            ale, mainly with th  e addition of key                       S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)

       It appears Profitline sold out at a time  when its sizable customer base of about 50                 Stock & option liquidity data 
       was losing business competitively to Tangoe .  As has been Tangoe's practice, we                    Market cap (USDm)                                                                484.2

       US Postal Service, with about $5m in annual revenue from the government sector,                    
       where Tangoe hasn't historically had              much presence. Two other private 
       competitors of roughly the same scale as Profitline-Rivermine and Symphony - 
       now remain. Recall IBM acquired Emptor             is last week, which owns Rivermine. 
       With IBM already a top partner of Tangoe, we wouldn't be surprised to see the 
       Rivermine assets carved off, which coul d be a net positive for Tangoe, the only 
       natural consolidator in the market. 
        
       Reiterate Buy and $18 PT 
       Our $18 price target is based on a CY13               uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
       EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.1x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, 
       of 30%. Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
       profitability from new projects not ramp         ing fast enough and customers taking 
       expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

                                    Tangoe acquires Profitline 

                                    Tangoe announced the acquisition of smaller private competitor Profitline, for $23.5m, about 
                                    1.6x CY12 revenue. This is Tangoe's third consolidative move this year, after acquiring HCL's 
                                    TEM business and Telwares early in 2011. Th  e acquisition will bring about $14m-$15m in 
                                    2012 revenues and the company expects slight accretion as customers are migrated 
                                    gradually to Tangoe's platform over the next           12-18 months. With a good track record of 
                                    integrating acquisitions, we see this move as fu  rther improving Tangoe's scale, particularly 
                                    with the addition of key government agencies as customers. We reiterate our Buy rating and 
                                    $18 PT.

                                    Consolidation Opportunity Ripe and Unique to Tangoe 

                                    It appears Profitline sold out at a time when  its sizable customer base of about 50 was losing 
                                    business competitively to Tangoe. As has been  Tangoe's practice, we will likely see many of 
                                    the approximately 100 employees become integrat ed early in the process, with customers 
                                    gradually migrating to Tangoe's   platform over the next four to six quarters. Customers 
                                    include Starbucks, BASF, NASA , DoD and the US Postal Service, with about $5m in annual 
                                    revenue from the government sector, where Ta ngoe hasn't historically had much presence. 
                                    Two other private competitors of roughly the same scale as Profitline-Rivermine and 
                                    Symphony - now remain. Recall IBM acquired Em  ptoris last week, which owns Rivermine. 
                                    With IBM already a top partner of Tangoe, we   wouldn't be surprised to see the Rivermine 
                                    assets carved off, which could be a net positive  for Tangoe, the only natural consolidator in 
                                    the market.

                                              Our $18 price target is based on a CY13 uF                          CF/share estimate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G 
                                              multiple of 1.1x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 30%. Risks include 
                                              execution risk from integrating acquisitions                    , delayed profitability from new projects not

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

        IBM to acquire Emptoris; net positive for Tangoe            Reuters:TNGO.OQ Exchange:NMS Ticker:TNGO
                                                                                      

        Price (USD)              14.53 IBM (Buy, USD188.72) this morning announced that it is acquiring Emptoris,
                                       a provider of on-demand supply chain software.  We note that Rivermine,

                                       a smaller telecom expense management (TEM) competitor of Tangoe, was
        52-week range          14.83 - 8.75recently acquired by Emptoris.  We believe the Emptoris acquisition is fo-
        Market cap (USD)          471.3cused on IBM's efforts to beef up its software business.  IBM's relationship
                                       with Tangoe is on the consulting (Global Services) side of the business and
        Shares outstanding (m)        32.4
                                       we therefore don't see the Rivermine segment as directly competitive or
        Free float (%)             100 disruptive to the IBM partner relationship.
        Volume (14 Dec 2011)     217,800As a byproduct of the IBM-Emptoris deal, we also see the possibility of
        S&P 500 INDEX           1,211.82Tangoe being able to acquire the Rivermine customer base, in case IBM
                                       decides to focus purely on the supply chain assets of Emptoris.

                                   Commentary & Analysis

                                   We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy recurring revenue
                                   growth  (+68%  Y/Y)  and  solid  customer  wins.  The  company  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide
                                   fixed/mobile  communications  spend  (now  manages  ~$15.3B  of  the  ~$425B  CLM  market)  and  we
                                   believe  the  company  can  deliver  double-digit  EPS/revenue  growth  through  a  variety  of  drivers  (e.g.,
                                   greenfield opportunities, penetrate spend at existing customers, international expansion, drive leverage
                                   in the model, deepen alliances) for the foreseeable future. With the HCL/Telwares acquisitions in the
                                   rear-view mirror, we expect TNGO to continue its M&A strategy to acquire customers, geography, or
                                   technology.   Given   these   solid   fundamentals   and   an   attractive   valuation   (4.1x   CY12E   recurring
                                   revenue), we remain buyers.

                                   Tangoe reported 3Q11 non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.07/$27.3M, topping its guidance and
                                   our  $0.06/$26.5M  forecast,  with  strength  across  the  board. TNGO  posted  recurring  revenue  of
                                   $24.5M (up 67.9% Y/Y) and services revenue grew 11.2% Y/Y to $2.9M (we note the company is not
                                   actively  pushing  its  services  business  as  it  believes  it  is  more  prudent  to  focus  the  company's
                                   resources on the large opportunities present on the recurring revenue side of the business). We are
                                   particularly impressed with at least ~25-30% organic revenue growth and note adjusted EBITDA grew
                                   83% Y/Y to $3.3M. While MDM represents less than 10% of revenue today, we believe this segment
                                   represents a LT growth opportunity as mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) proliferate the corporate
                                   network.

                                   Tangoe closed 25 new customers during the quarter (vs. 25 new logos last quarter) and continues to
                                   displace competitors and home-grown systems. It is clear to us that Tangoe is executing on its plan to
                                   increasingly drive CLM spend through its platform, with total spend under management now at $15.3B,
                                   up  61.1%  Y/Y  and  5.5%  Q/Q.  Given  low  penetration  rates  at  existing  customers  (~33%  penetrated)
                                   and a large greenfield opportunity (~80% of companies use home grown systems), we expect Tangoe
                                   to continue driving spend through its platform for the foreseeable future.

                                   Regarding  the  macro  environment, management  highlighted  it  has  not  seen  any  impact  to  its
                                   business from macro headwinds and notes its pipelines are "robust." We believe Tangoe is relatively
                                   insulated   should   the   macro   environment   further   deteriorate   since:   1)   Tangoe's   contracts   are
                                   longer-term in duration (while contracts range from 2-5 years, the typical contract runs 2-3 years); and
                                   2)     Tangoe's     TEM     and     MDM     solutions     drive     ROI,     improve     efficiencies,     and     reduce
                                   compliance/regulatory/security   risks,   all   of   which   provide   an   additional   layer   of   stickiness.   As   a
                                   reminder, Tangoe delivered >20% organic recurring revenue growth during the '08/09 recession.

                                   Big win at IBM. In addition to the 25 new customers closed during the quarter, Tangoe highlighted a
                                   big win at IBM, where it closed a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement. In particular, Tangoe will
                                   deploy  fixed  TEM  solutions  (invoice  bill  processing)  and  is  replacing  a  combination  of  home-grown
                                   systems and third-party vendors. While we do not expect revenue until FY12, this deal is another signal
                                   the company is able to up/cross-sell its installed base. Separately, recall that IBM (along with Dell, HP,
                                   and Xerox) is one of Tangoe's key strategic partners and, together, alliances represent ~25% of new
                                   annual recurring revenue.

                                   International  expansion  provides  a  large  growth  opportunity. About  $4.1B  of  the  $15.3B  CLM
                                   spend managed is internationally domiciled (which is up 37% Y/Y and 17% Q/Q). However, much of
                                   this spend is just US-based, multi-national spend overseas. While Tangoe believes there is plenty of
                                   runway left to further penetrate US-based multi-national spend, the company believes that over 50% of
                                   the  $425B  in  global  CLM  spend  is  from  international  corporations  (much  of  which  is  greenfield
                                   opportunities).  To  that  end,  we  expect  Tangoe  to  build  out  its  European,  Asia  Pacific,  and  Latin
                                   American presence throughout FY12 (for example, we estimate the company has ~30 quota-carrying
                                   sales  reps  and  will  look  to  increase  capacity  by  40%  in  the  coming  months).  Given  the  large  and
                                   dynamic market opportunity, we believe this reinvestment makes sense, yet still expect the company to
                                   balance these efforts with margin expansion.

Leverage  in  the  model. The  integration  of  HCL  and  Telwares  (both  acquired  during  1Q11)  is
progressing  nicely.  Recall  that  HCL/Telwares  operated  at  lower  gross  margins  than  Tangoe,  which
have  served  as  a  short-term  drag  to  overall  margins  (gross  margin  dropped  to  52.1%  at  2Q11  from
57%  at  4Q10).  It  typically  takes  Tangoe  12-18  months  to  fully  transition  acquired  clients  to  its  CLM
platform  (from  the  acquired  platform)  and  we  expect  HCL/Telwares  should  be  no  different.  To  date,
Tangoe has transitioned a "minority" of customers and we believe it takes 1-2 quarters post-transition
to  see  margin  improvement  (HCL/Telwares  installations  have  third-party  costs  which  are  no  longer
needed  when  clients  migrate  to  Tangoe's  CLM  solution).  We  also  expect  Tangoe  to  successfully
up/cross-sell  legacy  HCL/Telwares  customers  to  its  comprehenisve  TEM/MDM  product  suite  upon
migration.  Bottom  line,  we  believe  Tangoe  can  drive  sequential  Q/Q  margin  improvement  and  are
pleased  to  see  the  combined  company's  margin  profile  back  up  to  52.8%  during  3Q11.  We  also
anticipate gross margin can revert back to the mid-56% range next year.

Tangoe is not afraid to acquire technology, clients, and/or geographic presence. Through much
of its history, Tangoe has used acquisitions to augment its organic growth. Over the past four years,
Tangoe  acquired  five  companies  in  order  to  obtain  new  technology,  grow  its  customer  base,  and
extend its geographic reach. Overall, these deals allowed the firm to develop and integrate a holistic
CLM  offering  and  up-sell/cross-sell  its  combined  CLM  suite  to  a  larger  installed  base.  With  the
HCL/Telwares  acquisitions  in  the  rear-view  mirror,  we  expect  TNGO  to  continue  its  M&A  strategy  to
acquire  customers,  geography,  or  technology  to  augment  the  company's  ~20%  organic  recurring
revenue growth goals. Given the robustness of its CLM platform, we suspect the company may initially
focus  on  customers  /  geographic-based  acquisitions  over  technology-based  ones  in  the  short  term.
However, we expect Tangoe to continue to engage in tuck-in acquisitions across all three axes over
the next few years in order to scale and capture share.

Altogether,  we  continue  to  believe the  CLM  market  is  still  in  its  earliest  stages  of  growth,  as
enterprises are just beginning to address the need to centrally manage a disparate inventory of fixed
and  mobile  assets.  This  function  should  only  increase  in  importance  as  enterprises  connect  mobile
devices  (smartphones,  tablets)  to  the  corporate  network  at  an  accelerating  pace.  As  a  result  of  this
growing  complexity,  companies  will  have  to  move  off  outdated,  home-grown  systems  to  effectively
manage  telecom  resources.  Given  Tangoe's  leadership  position  in  the  CLM  space  (Tangoe  is  more
than 3X larger than its nearest competitor and is the only player to combine TEM/MDM in one solution)
and    a    healthy    moat    (Tangoe's    CLM    solution    supports    16    languages,    125    currencies,    200
countries/territories,  1,900  billing  formats,  1,700  carriers  globally,  and  was  awarded  12  patents),  we
believe the company should be able to effectively capture this large opportunity and deliver double-digit
EPS/revenue growth for the foreseeable future.

Tangoe's Revised Outlook

Tangoe raised its 2011 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $103.2-103.6M (versus its prior outlook of
$101.4-102.2M) and adjusted its non-GAAP EPS guidance to $0.25 (versus its prior outlook of
$0.24-0.25). The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA range to $12.2-12.4M from $11.8-12.2M as
a  result  of  the  strength  in  the  quarter  and  better  visibility  into  the  remainder  of  the  year.  TNGO
assumes a 7% tax rate for the full year and about 33.7M shares outstanding.

For 4Q11, Tangoe expects non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.07 and $27.5-27.9M. The company
also expects adjusted EBITDA to come in at $3.2-3.4M and assumes a 7% tax rate and 38.5M shares
outstanding.

Changes to our Model
Following TNGO's solid 3Q11 results and revised outlook, we've adjusted our model. We have
increased our CY11E EPS and revenue to $0.25/$103.6M from $0.25/$102.0M, reflecting the recent
momentum  in  and  TNGO's  improved  outlook  for  the  business.  We  note  our  CY11  free  cash  flow
forecast also improved to $7.7M (vs. $7.1M). We similarly raised our CY12 EPS estimate to $0.39 (vs.
$0.38), revenue forecast to $121.3M (vs. $117.9M), and FCF estimate to $16.6M (vs. $14.8M). A more
detailed breakout of our model changes is contained in the exhibit below:

Tangoe

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $16 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.7x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $109.7M. We note the SaaS
  peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (its
  MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to SaaS architecture by end of
  next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the "stickiness" of its installed
  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,  subscriptions  model),  its  robust  growth  rates  (40%  five-year  CAGR),
  market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with
  its peers, which leads us to our $16 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.

      IBM deal vindicates market opportunit        y, and view this strengthening existing         
      partnership, and potentially opening ne  w revenue opportunities with IBM over 
      time. We view recurring revenue organic growth of 29%, in-line with last qtrs 
      28%, as solid, and we think current 4Q es timates of total organic revenue growth 
      is 18% and organic recurring revenue growth of 20% in 4Q, could be conservative 
      given current momentum 
      MDM, international expansion and current partner investments could lead 
      upside in 2012 
      MDM represents <10% of revenue, and could benefit from enterprise adoption of 
      greater number of mobile form factors.  They continue to benefit from the major 
      2Q product release and clos ed biz with Expedia, Biog en, AmerisourceBergen and 
      PWC. The company continues to invest internationally (intnl biz is up 37% y/y) and 
      believe new investments could potentially  see greater revenue contribution from 
      APAC in 2012, like Europe in 2011. We bel  ieve recent partner additions like HP 
      and ACS (broke into Xerox this quarter) are beginning to ramp, and their full impact 
      can be seen only in 2012. We are raising revenue estimates for higher business 
      momentum, but maintain EPS expectations  as we expect much of upside to be 
      fueled back to drive growth. 
      Reiterate Buy and raise target to $18 (from $17) 
      Our $18 price target is based on a CY13           uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
      EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.1x (slight       premium to the peer group given market 
      leadership), and an estimated five-year gr  owth rate, net of dilution, of 30% (up 
      from 26%). Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
      profitability from new projects not ramp  ing fast enough and customers taking

                                 growth of 28% came above our expectations,   and we view current 2011 expectations as

                                 Expanding lead in nascent market; large IBM win vindicates market opportunity 
                                 Tangoe continues to penetrate the growing ma  rket for CLM with about $15.3b in spend 
                                 managed (up 6% q/q) within an estimated   potential TAM of $425b globally. The company 
                                 added 25 new customers, in-line with 2Q, and   within range of targeted 25 -30 customers, 
                                 and also had up-sell into major customers, both including Motorola, BlueCoat, Honeywell and 
                                 Novartis. The large multi-million dollar internal  IBM deal vindicates ma rket opportunity, and 
                                 view this strengthening exis      ting partnership, and pote     ntially opening new revenue 
                                 opportunities with IBM over time. We view recu rring revenue organic growth of 29%, in-line 
                                 with last qtrs 28%, as solid,  and we think current 4Q estima  tes of total organic revenue 
                                 growth is 18% and organic recurring revenue growth of 20% in 4Q, could be conservative 
                                 given current momentum.

                                 MDM represents <10% of revenue, and could benefit from enterprise adoption of greater

                                 to invest internationally (int  nl biz is up 37% y/y) and      believe new investments could 
                                 potentially see greater revenue  contribution from APAC in  2012, like Europe in 2011. We 
                                 believe recent partner additions like HP and ACS (broke into Xerox this quarter) are beginning 
                                 to ramp, and their full impact can be seen on ly in 2012. We are raising revenue estimates for

                                         Reiterate Buy and raise target to $18 (from $17) 

                                         Our $18 price target is based on a CY13 uF                   CF/share estimate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G 
                                         multiple of 1.1x (slight premium to the peer group given market leadership), and an estimated 
                                         five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 30%  (up from 26%, as we see current investments 
                                         pushing out higher cash flow margins over time) 

                                         Risks 

                                         Risks include execution risk fr         om integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
                                         projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing inhouse after 
                                         early gains from Tangoes platform.

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

                                                     We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy

                                                     continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide  fixed/mobile  communications  spend  (now

                                                     fundamentals  and  an  attractive  valuation  (4.1x  CY12E  recurring  rev.),  we  remain
                                                     buyers.

                                   TNGO: Dancin' To A Solid Quarter; Raising PT to $16

                                   We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy recurring revenue
                                   growth  (+68%  Y/Y)  and  solid  customer  wins.  The  company  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide
                                   fixed/mobile  communications  spend  (now  manages  ~$15.3B  of  the  ~$425B  CLM  market),  and  we
                                   believe Tango can deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth through a variety of drivers (e.g., greenfield
                                   opportunities,  penetrate  spend  at  existing  customers,  international  expansion,  drive  leverage  in  the
                                   model,   deepen   alliances)   for   the   foreseeable   future.   With   the   HCL/Telwares   acquisitions   in   the
                                   rear-view mirror, we expect TNGO to continue its M&A strategy to acquire customers, geography, or
                                   technology. Given these solid fundamentals and an attractive valuation (4.1x CY12E recurring rev.), we
                                   remain buyers.

                                   Delivers   a   solid   3Q. TNGO   posted   3Q11   EPS/rev.   of   $0.07/$27.3M,   vs.   our   estimates   of
                                   $0.06/$26.5M. The healthy results were led by strong subscription rev. growth (up 68% Y/Y to $24.5M)
                                   and  solid  uptake  across  TEM/MDM  products.  We  are  particularly  impressed  with  at  least  ~25-30%
                                   organic rev. growth and 83% adjusted EBITDA growth Y/Y to $3.3M.

                                   Big win at IBM. Tangoe closed a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement at IBM during the quarter.
                                   While we don't expect rev. until FY12, this deal is another signal the company is able to up/cross-sell
                                   its installed base. Separately, TNGO added 25 new customers during 3Q11 (same as in 2Q11).

                                   Expect   more   acquisitions.   TNGO   acquired   five   companies   in   the   past   four   years   to   obtain
                                   technology, customers, and extend its geographic reach. These acquisitions enabled TNGO to develop
                                   and  up/cross-sell  a  holistic  CLM  (communications  lifecycle  management)  suite  to  a  larger  installed
                                   base. Going forward, we expect TNGO to engage in additional tuck-in acquisitions to scale along these
                                   three axes.

                                   Adjusting    estimates. We    now    expect    FY11E    and    FY12E    EPS/rev.    of    $0.25/$103.6M    and
                                   $0.39/$121.3M, from $0.25/$102.0M and $0.38/$117.9M, respectively.

                                   Valuation attractive. At ~$14, TNGO trades at 4.1x CY12E recurring rev. vs. peers at 4.9x. Given the
                                   company's growth prospects, solid revenue visibility, and leverage in the model, we believe it should
                                   trade more in line with peers.

                                   ADBE: Realigns Business Once Again...Plans to Shed 7.5% of Workforce and Shift Model

                                   After the bell yesterday, Adobe announced its plans to realign its business around its Digital Media and
                                   Digital Marketing solutions and to shift more of its business from perpetual license deals to recurring
                                   revenue via its subscription offering. As part of the restructuring, the company intends on eliminating
                                   750 full-time employees (roughly 10% more than its last round of head-count reductions in 11/09) and
                                   materially stepping up its investments in these two digital areas. The company also highlighted that in
                                   order to drive sales and bookings in its digital marketing solutions, it plans on cutting its investments
                                   and license sales from certain enterprise solution product lines. Adobe management stated the impact
                                   from these changes will likely reduce FY12 revenue growth by approximately 4-5%. We note Adobe
                                   now  expects  FY12  revenue  growth  of  4-6%,  below  our  and  Street  forecasts  of  roughly  9%.  Looking
                                   ahead, management believes it can accelerate revenue growth to double-digits in FY13 and beyond.

                                   Along  with  these  changes,  we  expect  Adobe  to  ramp  its  spend  on  its  HTML5  efforts,  focus  on
                                   enhancing  its  digital  publishing  solutions,  invest  in  its  media  monetization  initiatives,  try  to  bring
                                   innovation to its Creative Suite and step up its leadership position in document services. The net result
                                   of  these  actions  and  increased  investments  is  margins  are  likely  flat  in  FY12.  Thus,  while  valuation
                                   appears inexpensive and we believe Adobe's decision to focus on these two large growth areas and
                                   shift its business to a more predictable model could pay off over time, given these efforts will likely take
                                   time to come to fruition, its healthy exposure to Europe and limited margin expansion on the horizon,
                                   we remain on the sidelines.

                                   4Q11 tracking well. Although there are still four weeks remaining in the quarter, we believe ADBE is

on  track  to  at  least  meet  our  estimates  of  $0.59  on  revenue  of  $1091.5  million.  Despite  the  macro

Digital  Marketing,  it  plans  to  cut  750  full-time  positions,  which  is  anticipated  to  cost  the  company
$87-94M in pre-tax restructuring costs.

Estimates unchanged for now. We are leaving our ests unchanged until we gain additional insight
into ADBE's restructuring and re-alignment plans.

Valuation. At ~$28 in after hours trading, ADBE trades at ~11x our FY12E EPS versus its large-cap
peers  at  ~12.5x.  While  we  don't  anticipate  material  multiple  expansion  any  time  soon,  we  believe
downside is relatively limited.

Mozilla Firefox Now Supports Amazon's Kindle Cloud Reader; Internet Explorer Support Coming

Soon?

Yesterday, Amazon disclosed  its  Kindle  Cloud  Reader  was  now  available  on  Mozilla  Firefox.  The
company's HTML5 based webapp, called Cloud Reader, is a web based e-book reader, which enables
users   to   read   Kindle   books   instantly   in   their   browsers   and   across   devices.   With   this   latest
announcement,  we  note  Amazon's  Kindle  webapp  is  now  available  on Google's Chrome  browser,
Apple's Safari browser and now Mozilla's Firefox browser. We believe Microsoft's Internet Explorer
will  also  likely  support  Amazon's  webapp  shortly,  thus  providing  Amazon  with  coverage  of  most
browsers.

  Price Target Calculation
  TNGO: We arrive at our $16 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.7x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $109.7M. We note
  the software-as-a-service peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a
  pure SaaS-only shop (its MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to
  SaaS architecture by end of next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the
  "stickiness" of its installed base, the recurring nature of its revenue (strong renewal rates, subscriptions model), its robust growth rates
  (40% five-year CAGR), market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should
  trade roughly in line with its peers, which leads us to our $16 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target
  TNGO:There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be
  delayed and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected;
  loss of a material customer; increased competition from vendors with larger resources and scale; and the possibility that the company
  will be unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining
  our price target.

product-oriented approach an d a multi-tenant SaaS platform provides scale and                  
margin leverage over time.  Tangoe has also taken advantage of the fragmentation 
to make five key acquisitions since 2007,  entering new segments, geographies or 
acquiring a customer base.  The compan             ys recent partnerships with global 
system integrators IBM, Dell, HP and X            erox, significantly expand its reach.  
Tangoes solution supports 1,700 operator   billing models in 180 countries, 125 
currencies and 16 languages, providing significant barriers to entry. 
Sticky solution with high visibility 
Tangoes bundled technology and services generally pay for themselves within the 
first year, creating a sticky solution and  a recurring revenue stream.  The 2-5 year 
contracts and proven deployment methodolog y provide high visibility into future 
revenues, typically 70% in the year ahea d and 90% a quarter ahead.  Customers 
deploying Tangoes solution benefit immediately from the automation of bill 
processing, a tedious monthly ritual at mo st enterprises globally.  Customers can 
also reduce their spending by detecting err ors, optimizing contracts, provisioning 
new service or device and managing mobile devices remotely. 
Buy rating and a $17 price target 
Our $17 price target is based on a CY13             uFCF/share estimate of $0.48, an 
EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x (slight        premium to the peer group given market 
leadership), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of dilution, of 26%.  Risks 
include execution risk from  integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
projects not ramping fast enough and   customers taking expense processing in-
house after early gains from Tangoes platform.  See also pp. 31-33.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                   

                               Investment thesis 

                               Outlook 

                               Tangoe is the clear market leader in the em   erging segment of communications lifecycle 
                               management.  Over the past decade, Tangoe ha s developed a platform to help enterprises 
                               manage and optimize their        telecommunications spending.  We believe Tangoe's 
                               comprehensive solution, robustly growing recu rring revenue (>25% organically) and global 
                               reach give investors an opportunity to own a quality stock early in its public life.   

                               With about $14bn in expenses under management, Tangoe is 3x larger than its closest 
                               competitor in the space, which today is     fairly fragmented and predominantly services-
                               oriented.  We believe Tangoes product-oriente d approach and a multi-tenant SaaS platform 
                               provides scale and margin leverage over ti    me.  Tangoe has taken advantage of the 
                               fragmentation to make five key acquisitions  since 2007, entering new segments, geography 
                               or acquiring a customer base.  And the compan  ys recent partnerships with global system 
                               integrators IBM, Dell, HP and Xerox significan  tly expand their reach.  The global presence 
                               developed over the past decade supports 1,700 operator billing models in 180 countries, 125 
                               currencies and 16 languages providing significant barriers to entry. 

                               Tangoes bundled technology and services genera lly pay for themselves within the first year, 
                               creating a sticky solution and a recurring reve nue stream.  Tangoes 2-5 year contracts and 
                               proven deployment methodology provide high visi bility into future revenues, typically 70% in 
                               the year ahead and 90% in the quarter ahea     d.  Customers deploying Tangoes solution 
                               benefit immediately from the automation of bi ll processing, a tedious monthly ritual at most 
                               enterprises globally.  Customers can also     reduce their spending by detecting errors, 
                               optimizing contracts, provisi oning new service, managing mobile devices remotely and 
                               device disposal/recycling. 

                               Valuation 

                               We believe its best to value companies like Tangoe based on their cash flows.  Our $17 
                               price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share esti mate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x 
                               (in line with the peer group), and a five-year grow th rate, net of dilution, of 23%.  We cross-
                               check our valuation with a DCF analysis, shown on pages 32-33. 

                               Risks 

                               Risks include execution risk fr  om integrating acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
                               projects not ramping fast enough and customers  taking expense processing in-house after 
                               early gains from Tangoes platform.  Some       customers may also perceive aggregated 
                               customer data as a privacy issue.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                   

                               Investment Positives 

                               Commanding lead in a nascent, specialized market segment 
                               Tangoe is the clear market leader in the emerging segment of telecom expense management 
                               (TEM), with global scale and a rapidly growing adjacency into mobile device management.  
                               Tangoe offers a complete portfolio that includes  fixed and mobile TEM solutions, particularly 
                               attractive to multinational corporations who can consolidate their cost savings on to a single 
                               platform.  The bundled technology and servic es measurably reduce telecom expenses, with 
                               payback typically within the first year.   

                               Powerful barriers to entry 
                               Tangoe is the largest provider in the TEM soft  ware space with roughly 8% market share, 
                               based on annual recurring revenues.  The next ne arest competitor is less than a third the size 
                               in a still-fragmented market  dominated by consulting firms and relatively few purely product-
                               oriented solutions.  Tangoe currently manage s about $14bn telecom expenses annually in a 
                               market of over $400bn globally, allowing abundant  room to grow over time.  Tangoes global 
                               presence developed over the past decade, with  support for 1,700 operator billing models in 
                               180 countries, 125 currencies and 16 languages provide significant barriers to entry. 

                               Acquisitions accelerate market share, backed by strong organic analysis  
                               Tangoe has made five acquisitions since 2007,  each of which enabled the company to gain 
                               market share as well expand its portfolio.  In addition, organic revenue consistently grew over 
                               20% (over 25% for recurring) during this period , together delivering revenue CAGR of almost 
                               50% since 2007. 

                               Scale benefits from a product-oriented approach 
                               Tangoes on-demand software platform provides  customers relatively quick deployment that 
                               drives high automation rates after the initial setup.  The scalable multi-tenant architecture has 
                               the potential to cannibalize a largely consulti ng-oriented market that is over $500m in size, 
                               since product effectiveness is consistently hi gher and these scale benefits result in higher 
                               margins over time. 

                               Highly visible recurring revenue 
                               Tangoes contract term ranges from 24 mont     hs to 60 months with ASPs ranging from 
                               $150k-200k.  Tangoes revenue mix is 90% rec  urring given the nature of monthly telecom 
                               bills.  Multi-year contracts and the convenience of automating  a historically manual process 
                               tend to create a sticky solution with customers .  Retention rates have been consistently over 
                               90%, with any loss typically due to customers e  xiting the market alto gether, e.g., through 
                               consolidation or M&A. 

                               Diversified, blue-chip customer base  
                               Tangoe has flagship customers across the financial, healthcare, technology, consulting, and 
                               transportation verticals.  Some leading cust omers are Bank of America, Novartis, Dell, IBM 
                               and FedEx. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for 2008, 2009 
                               or 2010. Today, most customers are US-based mu ltinationals, but a new sales office in the 
                               Netherlands should help expand the companys footprint into Western Europe, a market only 
                               slightly behind the US in the development of TEM solutions. 

                               Strong channel partners expand reach 
                               In an effort to expand reach  and accelerate global growth, Tangoe has signed on leading 
                               system integration firms, including IBM, Dell, HP, Xerox and 16 other regional firms.  Share or 
                               partner-driven revenue is relatively small toda y, but over 20% of new bookings are coming 
                               from the channel, a share we expect to grow over time.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                 

                               Investment Risks 

                               Once early gains are captured in reducing costs, customers may take efforts in-house 
                               Customers pay a percentage of savings to Ta   ngoe. Once systematiz ed, customers could 
                               decide to save themselves the payment to Ta ngoe by taking the processing of invoices in-
                               house.  There have been no recent incidents of customer loss in such a fashion. 

                               People-intensive model could hurt margins if customers dont ramp up as planned 
                               Integrating the customers IT environment into Tangoes infrastructure is a complex task and 
                               delays could impact margins.  The company  has a standardize approach developed over the 
                               past decade, but rapid growth into new geographies and use of partners to deliver solutions 
                               may impact the margin profile. 

                               Acquired assets may not get integrated efficiently 
                               The companys growth has benefited from five acquisitions made since 2007.  While each of 
                               these acquisitions has improved the companys    strategic position in  the market and the 
                               relatively low multiples paid have helped accret ion, integration of future acquisitions could 
                               become more complex as the company grows larger. 

                               Aggregated customer data could be perceived as a privacy or competitive risk 
                               Tangoes knowledgebase of contracts and best practices is built up over time by aggregating 
                               historical data, which some customers might  consider risky from a privacy perspective. Any 
                               dramatic changes in the regulatory environment may also impact Tangoes ability to compete 
                               internationally. 

                               Large customers or resellers such as IBM and Dell could concentrate revenues 
                               Loss of a large customer or channel could      significantly impact the business. Current 
                               customer count of over 600 and no customer over 10% of revenue reduce this likelihood. 

                               Lack of up-front billings suppress cash flow as compared to typical SaaS model 
                               The company bills customers monthly in arrears  as new invoices are processed. Unlike the 
                               typical SaaS company, where ad vance billing results in significa nt deferred revenue build-up, 
                               Tangoes business model does not benefit from up-front cash payments.  However, future 
                               cash flows should grow higher with the number of customers and expenses under 
                               management. 

                               Channel approach and expansion into new geographies increase cost profile 
                               The companys efforts to expand  internationally by partnering  with local resellers and by 
                               establishing local offices could increase costs and reduce margins during this expansion.

                               Industry Overview 

                               Communications Lifecycle Management (CLM) 

                               The telecom industry has seen significant cha nge over the past decade, with the growth in 
                               VoIP, mobile voice and data s ervices, and changes in regulator y regimes globally, most of 
                               which caused dramatic changes in tariffs and   the competitive landscape.  As corporations 
                               began to expand globally, spen ding on telecom services took  on a much more significant 
                               role. Enterprises are increasingly seeking solu  tions to effectively an d efficiently manage, 
                               control and optimize their expanding communica tions assets, services, usage and associated 
                               expenses. The CLM market provides solutions to  help meet this demand. The CLM market 
                               consists of the telecommunications expense ma nagement, or TEM, market and the mobile 
                               device management, or MDM, market, which is an emerging market adjacent to TEM. 

                               Corporations globally spend over $400bn annually on  telecom services, which include office 
                               phones, internet and data connectivity, wirele ss voice and data services and more recently, 
                               the remote management of mobile devices used  by staff.  Inefficient management of these 
                               expenses, including overpayments due to billing  errors, often results in enterprises incurring 
                               significant avoidable expenses. Below we disc uss some common trends  driving the uptake 
                               of CLM solutions. 

                               Large volume and complexity of bills 
                               A companys communications infrastructure is     critical for its smooth operations. With 
                               advancing technology, communication infrastructure has encompassed a growing diversity of 
                               technologies. Billing systems vary across operato rs, each with varying payment terms.  And 
                               different countries have different regulatory an d tax regimes. Multi-national companies have 
                               to contend with multiple operators, currencies, languages and regulatory requirements. This 
                               provides a ripe opportunity for telecom expense management.  

                               Significant increase in the number of mobile users and what devices are used for 
                               Mobile devices and their use fo r both voice and data applicat ions looks dramatically different 
                               today than it did just five years ago.  Not on ly are more people roaming with their devices as 
                               they travel, many are using smartphones an    d tablets to access enterprise applications 
                               remotely in addition to making plain old phon  e calls.  The need to manage expenses and 
                               devices is amplified by IT security and policy concerns as several personal devices are 
                               provisioned for corporate use and vice vers  a.  Gartner estimates worldwide converged 
                               mobile device enterprise shipments grew at   a CAGR of 54% from 2005-10. And mobile 
                               applications deployed by enterprises will grow at 30% in 2011. 

                               Dynamic changes in communication infrastructure and services creates a need for TEM 
                               Telecommunication expenditure, ranging 1%-3%  of revenue, is a significant portion of an 
                               enterprise budget. Gartner estimates TEM serv  ices to grow at a double-digit compound 
                               annual growth rate through 2014. There are   roughly 300 TEM vendors globally with about 
                               $1bn market size in 2011. The top 10 software-oriented vendors account for about $200m in 
                               recurring revenue.  The rest is a highly fragmented mix of services-oriented firms who 
                               perform custom projects for clients.  These pro jects typically dont use a robust technology 
                               back-end and have low repeatability across customers. 

                               Note the distinction between telecom expense s (over $400bn annually) and the TEM vendor 
                               space, which is estimated at about $1bn per ye  ar.  The latter is the collective revenue of 
                               vendors who provide TEM solutions to optimize  the $400bn annual spend.  The market size 
                               for mobile device management, MDM, is es  timated by IDC to be about $300m in 2010, 
                               growing to $1.2bn in 2015.  Depending on the definition and scope of MDM, various industry

                                  analysts size this market ranging from a few      hundred million dollars to  a billion dollars or 
                                  more per year.  We believe $300m is a reasonable estimate for 2010 given the plethora 
                                  smartphones and tablets hitting the market and  the number of enterprise applications being 
                                  made available on them.  We estimate MDM should grow by 25% y/y or more, over the next 
                                  five years.

                                     Obviously the capabilities of ea  ch device determine the level of functionality that can be 
                                     made available via an MDM platform.  Enterpri  se-oriented devices like the BlackBerry were 
                                     built with many of these capabilities in the          back-end infrastructure.  And many consumer-
                                     oriented devices like the iPhone and Android              have an ecosystem of third-party software 
                                     vendors building such capabilities.  Vendors   in MDM range from small pure-play shops to 
                                     large enterprise software and security vendors.    

                                     Market penetration assumptions and scenarios 

                                     Considering the global enterprise telecom spend of $430bn, Tangoe currently manages about 
                                     $14bn, just 3% of this industry revenue strea  m. With such low penet ration today and with 
                                     Tangoe being the leading player, the opportunity ahead is large and attractive.  

                                     In our scenario analysis below, we change                  market penetration each year by 100 
                                     bps/120bps/150bps y/y in our base case/optimisti c case/aggressive case. It is worth noting 
                                     that a small increase in penetration levels ac ts as a powerful lever, almost doubling revenue 
                                     from $360m revenue in 2020 in the base case   scenario to over $600m in revenue with an 
                                     aggressive scenario.

                               Competition 

                               As described in the Industry section above,   Tangoe operates primarily in the TEM domain 
                               with a growing presence in mobile device management (MDM).  Tangoe is the only company 
                               that has a presence in both TEM and MDM spac  e. Tangoe is ranked a leader in Gartners 
                               TEM Magic Quadrant for the breadth and completeness of its portfolio, process 
                               management and advisory services.   

                               Within the MDM space, Gartner rates Tangoe a  Challenger with competitive products that 
                               address the basic needs of MDM.  Industry an alyst IDC estimates Tang oes market share in 
                               MDM to be about 2% in 2010 as larger vendors such as Sybase (part of SAP), Microsoft, HP, 
                               IBM and Symantec take the top five spots in  the space, collectively with about 48% market 
                               share.  Clearly, Tangoe is a small player in MDM,  but its offering sold with TEM is likely more 
                               attractive to enterprise clients who dont want to invest in a large, standalone MDM solution. 

                               Market leader with significant lead vs. competition 
                               Tangoe is far ahead of its competitors in th  e domain of telecom expense management.  
                               Based on estimates of software-based vendors  with a recurring revenue model, Tangoe is 
                               roughly 33 percentage points ahead of its nea    rest competitor in terms of the recurring 
                               FY2011E revenue.

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                     

                                Other notable competitors fall in three broad groups: 

                                         Large SI firms with global presence  : focus on multinational customers and a 
                                         vendor- neutral, consulting-oriented approach: Accenture, CSC, Dell (Perot 
                                         Systems), IBM Global Services, HP (EDS), X erox (ACS) fall in this group. Note that 
                                         IBM is Tangoes largest partner and Dell, HP and Xerox are new partnerships. 

                                         Large telcos : AT&T and Vodafone provide TEM s  ervices to their large enterprise 
                                         clients. However, since these services are  provided by the operator themselves, in 
                                         many markets via private-label offerings,  there is a heavier services and consulting 
                                         component and a perceived lack of neutrality. 

                                         Smaller consulting and product providers  : Anatole (France), Asential, Avalon 
                                         Avotus, Ezwim (Netherlands), MDSL (UK       ), Telesoft, TNX, Ttmobiles (UK) and 
                                         Veramark. Each of these vendors specializes   in a region, fixed or mobile, size of 
                                         customer, BPO model, etc., with revenues ranging from $5m to $15m annually.  

                                Competition in the MDM space is much more fragmented at the lower end of the market. 
                                However, as discussed above, the top five players own about half the market. But given the 
                                rapidly evolving smartphone and tablet mark  etplace, we could see many of the following 
                                specialty vendors make headway on their own,   or get acquired by larger firms: AirWatch, 
                                Boxtone, Capricode (Finland),    Excitor (Denmark), FancyFon     (Ireland), Fiberlink, Fixmo, 
                                Fromdistance (Estonia), IBELEM (France), MobileIron, Good Technology (best known for 
                                push email platform), Zenprise, etc. 

                                Traditional security firms like Symantec, Mc Afee, and connectivity software companies like 
                                Smith Micro consider MDM an adjacent space to expand their core offering.

                                       Customer perception is that fixed and mobile are two different products, which they 
                                       are today.  Architecture work is on-going to create a common product. 
                                       Early days of international expansion were  rocky.  New office in Amsterdam helps

6 September 2011       Application Software  Tangoe, Inc.                                                                    

                               Savings continue to accrue over time 
                               The value proposition that clients derive out  of implementing Tangoe solutions ranges from 
                               reducing errors that typically affect 25% of all   bills to lowering ongoing cost by 20%-40%.  
                               Without streamlined expense management, co mpanies lose between $500k to $50m each 
                               year.  Tangoe manages spend 3x larger and 5x   more devices than its closest competitor, 
                               given its breadth and strength in product s pectrum, now about $14bn in expenses and 1.8m 
                               mobile devices. 

                               After the initial gains in the first year, Tangoe continues to optimize contracts based on 
                               market rates and manages turnover in devices, voice/data plans, applications on devices, etc. 

                               Business Model 

                               Tangoe generates its revenues from subscriptions and services related to its 
                               Communications Management Platform. Thes          e services include help desk, asset 
                               procurement and provisioning, an d carrier dispute resolution.  The recurring technology and 
                               services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. Tangoe licenses its on-demand 
                               software primarily on a subscription basis un der agreements with terms ranging from 24 to 
                               60 months.  

                               The company bills its customers on a monthly     basis in arrears and hence does not have 
                               significant deferred revenues on  its balance sheet.  We note this significant difference from 
                               our other SaaS coverage, where annual or qu     arterly pre-payments are standard and cash 
                               collected up front with subsequent ratable revenue recognition boosts the cash flow margins 
                               for these companies.   

                               Figure 10 below shows the significant impa      ct pre-payments (shown as days deferred 
                               revenue, or DDR) can have on a companys un      levered free-cash-flow margins.  Note the 
                               difference in the theoretical cash flow margin s for a company growing revenue at 25% with 
                               DDR of 40 (a profile similar to Tangoe), compa red to another company growing at the same 
                               revenue rate but with DDR of 100 (typical of a SaaS company in our coverage).  Prepayments 
                               boost uFCF margin by about 4% points in this scenario, with an assumed baseline of 8% 
                               uFCF margin.  Investors should take this    into consideration when studying Tangoe. We 
                               discuss this further in the Valuation section.

                               10% in FY2010 with retention rate >90%. In addition to +20% organic revenue growth,

                               Tangoe has seen 22 consecutive quarters of revenue growth.

                                Despite significant acquisitions, the above analysis shows robust organic growth at 35-40% 
                                since 2007.  However, we are modeling organic         growth rate at 18-20% to factor in 
                                conservatism in the model.  

                                Inorganic route helps land-grab strategy 

                                Tangoe has made five key acquisitions sinc    e 2007 to expand its product and customer 
                                footprint.  The companys acquisitions are based on three key motivations: 

                                         Expand technology assets 

                                         New geographies 

                                         New customers 

                                The company has been disciplined about sales multiples for these acquisitions, typically 
                                paying 2x-3x of sales at the high end and below  1x at the low end, depending on the type of 
                                asset and percentage of recurring revenue.  Tr aditional software M&A multiples are usually 
                                higher, with our 10-year industry database    showing acquirers payi ng 4x-6x maintenance 
                                multiples in public company software M&A.  Tangoes gradually increasing operating margins 
                                during this period also indicates they are effective in the integration process.   

                                Also of note is the fact that executives fr om the acquired companie s generally have stayed 
                                on at Tangoe to run their respective business as  a division within Tangoe, another sign that 
                                these integrations are effective.

                                    Traq brought wireless TEM capabilities to Tangoe s organic fixed TEM platform.  Traq also 
                                    helped Tangoe accelerate its transition to         a recurring revenue model, as most of Traqs 
                                    revenue was recurring.  The mobile TEM and  fixed TEM products remained separate, mostly 
                                    since operators providing these services continue  to retain separate billing systems and end-
                                    users of fixed line services vs. mobile services  are also different within the typical enterprise.  
                                    Specifically, fixed-line services in the ent       erprise are related to de      sk phones and data 
                                    connectivity, where the end user is seldom involv ed in provisioning, bill payments, etc.  On 
                                    the other hand, with mobile devices, enterprises have a mix of corporate-liable and individual-
                                    liable devices, and end users a re typically involved in the paym ent of bills, either directly or 
                                    through their IT department. 

                                    Information Strategies Group (ISG)   had a fixed TEM product with a recurring revenue 
                                    model.  ISG also brought international capabiliti es to Tangoes solution .  By July 2008, over 
                                    half of Tangoes revenues were recurring in na ture.  By the end of  2008, Tangoe crossed the 
                                    80% threshold with the addition of ISG to the revenue mix. 

                                    Internoded was Tangoes foray into Mobile Device Management (MDM).  By the second 
                                    half of 2008, MDM had begun to get the attent ion of enterprises as the iPhone and Android 
                                    devices were becoming mainstream, applicatio ns were proliferating and enterprises were 
                                    looking for solutions to manage these typica            lly individual-liable de vices in a corporate 
                                    environment.  MDM was a natural adjacenc              y to TEM and Tangoe expanded its market 
                                    definition to include device-ori ented services, calling it CLM.  Internodeds platform has 
                                    evolved in its capabilities sinc e the acquisition but remains a standalone part of Tangoes 
                                    portfolio. 

                                    HCL Expense Management Services    and  Telwares acquisitions were both clearly a 
                                    strategic expansion of operations and enlargem ent of the customer base, with the potential 
                                    to cross-sell to the customers of HCL and Telw            ares the capabilities of Tangoes existing 
                                    solution. Through this acquisition the co         mpany added more than 100 customers with 
                                    aggregate annual telecommunications expense  under management in excess of $3 billion.  
                                    Both acquisitions were made in 1Q11, just befo re Tangoes IPO.  We believe the price paid 
                                    for both was below 1x sales, as both bu             sinesses had declining revenues and limited 
                                    technology differentiation. 

                                    Our analysis of organic revenues indicates that the company has been consistently growing 
                                    total revenue at over 20% for the past three years, with recurring revenues growing

                                We expect EBITDA margin to grow at a sl        ower pace near-term since Tangoe plans to 
                                investments in technological and process improvements along with overseas expansion. The 
                                EBITDA is expected to increase from $6.8M  to $12m (74% growth) in 2011. We expect the 
                                cost of recurring technology and services reve nue which consists of costs associated with 
                                data center operations, customer product suppo      rt centers and client services group to 
                                remain relatively stable on an annual basis.  

                                Tangoes business model comes with lower gross margins because of higher proportion of 
                                consulting and service content associated wi    th taking new customers live.  Like other 
                                companies in our coverage with technology-enabled services, human capital involved in 
                                implementing its solutions na turally suppresses gross margins as compared to more pure 
                                SaaS models. Specifically, gross margin is expected to decrease to 53% in 2011 due to 
                                acquisition of HCL and Telwares which had gross margins significantly below corporate 
                                average compared to 56% for Tangoe last         year.  With increasing focus on expanding 
                                software functionality of current offerings R&  D expense is expected to increase in dollar 
                                terms but decrease in percentage terms,       over time. R&D, G&A and Sales marketing 
                                investments are expected to be up by 35%, 23% and 27% in 2011 due to increased focus on 
                                technological and process improvements   .

                                    Operating cash flow has been positive for full year 2009 and 2010. It is likely to increase post 
                                    debt repayment as net interest expense is expected to decrease by 117% from FY11 to FY12 
                                    which should effectevly increase the net income. Cash flow from financing will show a one-
                                    time inflow from the IPO. The uFCF margin   grew from (2%) in 2008 (critical mass of SaaS 
                                    transition) to 6% in 2010. It is projected to  grow to 11% in 2012. The capex is about 2% of 
                                    revenue.

                                           Valuation 

                                           Tangoes subscription model is driven by a  relatively steady, recurring revenue stream from 
                                           multi-year contracts as well as new in-year                     bookings.  We believe it is best to value 
                                           subscription-based companies on a growth-adjusted unlevered free cash flow basis.  Our $17 
                                           price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share esti mate of $0.48, an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x 
                                           (slight premium to group given market leadership), and a five-year growth rate, net of dilution, 
                                           of 26%.

                                           Continuing our discussion from Figure 10, we note that since Tangoe doesnt bill customers 
                                           in advance, relative to other S aaS companies, its days of deferred revenue (DDR) metric is 
                                           relatively low, in the 47 range vs. our SaaS med ian of 93.  The current valuation for Tangoe, 
                                           therefore, is distorted by this fact, although the recurrent nature of its revenues is very similar 
                                           to other SaaS companies.  If Tangoe were to  bill customers in advance and had DDRs of 93 
                                           (median for our SaaS coverage), its unlevered cash flow margins would increase significantly, 
                                           from our CY12 estimate of 13% to 17%, based on   the analysis shown in Figure 11 earlier.  
                                           This would drive down the EV/FCF multiple, wh                       ich is at 24.3x currently, to 18.7x.  We 
                                           illustrate this in Figure 22 below.

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.

                                             Investment Thesis    

                                             We are initiating coverage of Tangoe with an Outperform rating and a 12-18-month price 
                                             target of $14.  Tangoe is a leading provider of communications lifecycle management 
                                             (CLM) solutions, a segment of the software market focused on managing the lifecycle of 
                                             an enterprise‟s communications assets and services.  Tangoe‟s customers utilize its CLM 
                                             platform to reduce costs by identifying/resolving billing errors, optimize service plans for 
                                             usage patterns/needs, and manage used/unused telecom assets and services.  Further, 
                                             customers rely on Tangoe‟s solution to automate mobile device provisioning and facilitate 
                                             compliance with internal policies/regulatory requirements.  Through a combination of 
                                             organic growth, successful acquisitions, and strategic alliances, Tangoe manages 
                                             ~$14.5B (more than any other vendor in the market) of the estimated ~$425B of 
                                             worldwide fixed/mobile communications spend per year.     

                                             We believe Tangoe offers the most comprehensive CLM product in the market by 
                                             combining fixed and mobile telecommunications expense management (TEM) and mobile 
                                             device management (MDM) in one solution.  Coupled with what we believe to be a large 
                                             and underpenetrated market opportunity, Tangoe has a variety of growth drivers in front of 
                                             it (e.g., manage additional spend at existing accounts, new customer acquisitions, 
                                             international expansion) that should enable it to deliver healthy double-digit revenue and 
                                             EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  These dynamics, combined with a “sticky” 
                                             customer base, solid visibility into its future revenue stream, and opportunity for multiple 
                                             expansion, lead us to believe that Tangoe is well positioned to outperform its competitors 
                                             and the broader markets over the next 12-18 months.

Key Points 

Tangoe’s CLM solution delivers healthy ROI for its customers that prospective 
customers should find attractive in a volatile economic environment.  Tangoe‟s CLM 
solution enables customers to manage, centralize, and reduce fixed and mobile 
communications spend, improve operational efficiency and productivity, align third-party 
service agreements with corporate initiatives, and strengthen corporate governance by 
managing privacy concerns and compliance with regulations/internal policies.  We note 
that Tangoe experienced solid demand during the last recession, as recurring revenue 
grew over 20% during the „08/‟09 downturn.  Since that time, Tangoe‟s value proposition 
has become even more attractive, as it now offers telecom expense management (TEM) 
and mobile device management (MDM) in one solution.   

Multiple growth drivers to tap, given a growing and underpenetrated market.  First, 
the CLM market is still in its earliest stages of growth, as enterprises are just beginning to 
address the need to centrally manage a disparate inventory of fixed and mobile assets.  
This function should only increase in importance as enterprises connect mobile devices 
(smartphones, tablets) to the corporate network at an accelerating pace.  As a result of 
this growing complexity, companies will have to move off of outdated, home-grown 
systems to effectively manage telecom resources.  Given its leadership position in the 
CLM space, Tangoe should be able to effectively capture this large opportunity (Tangoe 
estimates that 80% of enterprises use internally developed systems/processes to manage 
telecom assets).  Additionally, international expansion and future acquisitions should 
augment Tangoe‟s long-term growth rate.  We expect the company to deliver at least 15-
20% organic recurring revenue growth for the foreseeable future.   

Lots of leverage in the model.  There is significant operating leverage in the model that 
should enable Tangoe to deliver healthy margin expansion over the next few years.  For 
example, Tangoe‟s gross margins took a hit this year (we expect GM to trend down to 
approximately 53% in 2011 from 56.3% and 55.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively) as the 
company digests two recent acquisitions.  We note these integrations are on track and 
expect gross margins to increase back to 56% in 2012, with gross margins trending 
toward the low 60% range over the next 3-5 years.  Similarly, we expect Tangoe to deliver 
adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-11% range in 2011 (increasing from 10.0% and 7.8% 
in 2010 and 2009, respectively) and believe it should steadily increase toward the 
company‟s long-term target of 24-26% as the business gains critical mass. 

Seasoned management team.  Tangoe has a seasoned management team with deep 
experience in the CLM industry.  Albert Subbloie co-founded Tangoe and has served as 
its president and CEO since 2000.  Gary Martino (CFO since July 2007) was a member of 
Tangoe‟s board from February 2000 to March 2007.  Additionally, Tangoe co-founder 
Charles Gamble has served in several leadership roles at the company since February 
2000, and Albert Rossini has served as EVP of Global Sales since December 2006.  We 
note that Tangoe has rounded out its core management team by bringing on other CLM 
industry veterans through the company‟s acquisitive past.  We believe that Tangoe has 
assembled a quality management team and expect it will keep the company focused on 
the long-term CLM opportunity.     

Attractive valuation.  At $11.33, Tangoe trades at 3.4x our CY12 recurring revenue 
projection of $107.5M, a discount to the SaaS (software as a service) peer group multiple 
of 4.3x.  Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (the MDM product is 
delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate 
to a SaaS architecture by the end of next year).  However, given the company's growth 
prospects, solid revenue visibility, and leverage in the model, we believe it should trade in 
line with its peers.  As a result, we apply a 4.1x CY12 recurring revenue multiple to arrive 
at our $14 price target.

Growth Drivers 

Over the past four years, Tangoe has delivered impressive growth, moving from a $13M 
business in 2006 to over $68M in 2010 (representing ~50% CAGR).  While Tangoe 
continues to grow its installed base, we expect it will take time to deeply penetrate new 
customers‟ fixed and mobile telecom spend.  However, we believe Tangoe is well 
positioned to take advantage of the enterprise mobile revolution as smartphones and 
tablets connect to the corporate network at an accelerating pace.  Given numerous growth 
drivers and building market awareness, we believe Tangoe is well positioned to deliver at 
least 15-20% organic recurring revenue growth for the foreseeable future. 

Through internal development and acquisitions, Tangoe has assembled a comprehensive 
product portfolio.  The company continues to invest in R&D and spends more in R&D than 
several of its competitors generate in revenues.  We expect continued investment in R&D 
to enable the firm to roll out enhancements to its CLM platform that should keep customer 
retention high, target new revenue drivers (e.g., cross/up-sell opportunities), and bolster 
the company‟s long-term growth prospects. 

Greenfield opportunities abound.  Tangoe manages ~$14.5B of the estimated ~$425B 
of annual fixed/mobile communications spend worldwide.  As mobile assets have 
proliferated throughout the enterprise, companies have built piecemeal systems and 
processes to manage their collective inventory of communications assets.  Tangoe 
estimates that 80% of enterprises use home-grown systems, which are often manual in 
nature.  Typically, this infrastructure is not robust and cannot efficiently scale to handle 
new devices, regulatory/internal controls changes, or technologies.  Without a 
comprehensive CLM package, it is difficult for organizations (and especially so for 
multinationals) to centrally manage the enterprise-wide universe of telecom assets, verify 
the accuracy of monthly bills, or allocate costs to specific divisions or users.  We also note 
that carriers often issue statements in different formats, currencies, and languages, adding 
to this complexity.   

We expect Tangoe to continue investment in sales and marketing to drive awareness and 
build pipelines for its CLM solution.  As enterprises increasingly support employee 
connectivity of mobile devices to the corporate network (each with separate data plans, 
contract terms, and monthly bills) and increasing privacy and regulations/internal policies 
become more complex, it is clear to us that many corporations will be unable to effectively 
manage this process using outdated, home-grown systems going forward.   

Room to further penetrate existing accounts.  Tangoe has done an admirable job of 
delivering ROI for its customers, and we believe there are significant opportunities to 
broaden these relationships to manage greater amounts of their fixed and mobile spend.  
For example, we estimate on average, Tangoe has penetrated only ~33% of telecom 
spend per client as various buying centers within a client often own different pieces of a 
corporation‟s telecom spend and it takes time to develop relationships throughout the 
enterprise.  In fact, 25-35% of new annual recurring revenue comes from existing 
customer relationships (expansion into new geographies, add-on products, general 
increases in spend under management).  We expect over time, customers should see the 
value of Tangoe‟s offering and be more willing to hand over additional business and/or 
buy complementary products/services.  Further, Tangoe‟s quota-carrying sales team is 
compensated on annual recurring revenue added, which aligns their interests with the 
firm‟s desire to penetrate existing accounts for incremental revenue opportunities.   

Based on our assumption the company has penetrated only ~33% of its installed base and 
currently manages ~$14.5B, we believe Tangoe has the opportunity to increase telecom 
spend managed to over $40B just by fully penetrating its existing customers.  While we do 
not anticipate Tangoe will ever win 100% of its customers‟ business, we believe the 

                                                                                         5

                                                                                       228

Tangoe

                                              company will continue to expand its relationships, cross-sell/up-sell additional features 
                                              and services, and manage increasing amounts of telecom spend per customer over time. 

                                              Tangoe is not afraid to acquire technology, clients, and/or geographic presence.  
                                              Through much of its history, Tangoe has used acquisitions to augment its organic growth.  
                                              Over the past four years, Tangoe acquired five companies in order to obtain new 
                                              technology, grow its customer base, and extend its geographic reach.  Overall, these 
                                              deals allowed the firm to develop and integrate a holistic CLM offering and up-sell/cross-
                                              sell its combined CLM suite to a larger installed base.  We expect Tangoe to continue to 
                                              engage in tuck-in acquisitions over the next few years in order to continue scaling along 
                                              these three axes.   

                                              Strategic alliances a key part of Tangoe’s growth strategy.  In addition to its direct 
                                              sales force, Tangoe formed ~20 strategic alliances with a variety of channel 
                                              partners/resellers including ACS, Dell, HCL, and IBM.  These partners enable Tangoe to 
                                              extend its reach in the marketplace by reselling or white-labeling Tangoe‟s CLM solutions.  
                                              Partners often perform lead generation, sales, and ongoing management of customer 
                                              accounts.  Strategic alliances contribute approximately 25% to Tangoe‟s new sales, with 
                                              the IBM relationship alone accounting for revenues of 10.6% and 11.8% in 2010 and 
                                              2009, respectively.  

                                              Management notes that gross margins for partner sales are roughly consistent with direct 
                                              sales, as partners typically mark up the offerings to their clients.  In order to continue 
                                              expanding its market reach, we expect Tangoe to add one to two strategic relationships 
                                              (BPO and/or SI companies) over the next 12-24 months.  

                                              International expansion is in the early innings.  Approximately $3.5B of the ~$14.5B of 
                                              spend managed by Tangoe is domiciled internationally.  We note that in addition to 
                                              growing the overall size of the pie, Tangoe is looking to meaningfully expand its 
                                              international operations, since the vast majority of its international spend is from US-based 
                                              multinationals.  The company recently opened offices in Amsterdam (European HQ) and 
                                              China and has branches in London and Brussels.  Given the overall size of the market, 
                                              combined with the fact that Tangoe is just beginning to ramp its international presence, we 
                                              believe there is a significant opportunity for Tangoe to grow overseas.

Industry Trends 

Over the past decade, the breadth, complexity, and sophistication of an enterprise‟s fixed 
and mobile communications infrastructure has increased exponentially.  Historically, much 
of an organization‟s telecom footprint was fixed in nature and included telephones, lines, 
circuits, switches, and fixed networks.  Now, significant advances in telecom technology 
have expanded the corporate network to include a variety of new devices/technologies 
including mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) or Voice over IP (VoIP).  We believe 
many organizations do not have tools or systems in place to centrally manage fixed and 
mobile telecom assets in an effective and efficient manner.   

CLM is big business...and growing.  Tangoe estimates that enterprises spend ~$425B 
per year to manage fixed and mobile telecom assets and services.  Gartner‟s research 
suggests that the TEM market should grow at over a 20% CAGR through 2013, with 
mobile growth outpacing fixed growth.  

However, many companies still use manual, home-grown solutions to manage 
communications assets.  As mobile assets have proliferated throughout the enterprise, 
companies have built piecemeal systems and processes to manage their collective 
inventory of communications assets.  Tangoe estimates that 80% of enterprises use 
home-grown systems, often manual in nature.  Typically, this infrastructure is not robust 
and cannot efficiently scale to handle new devices, regulatory/internal control changes, or 
technologies.  As a result, it is difficult for organizations (especially multinationals) to 
centrally manage the enterprise-wide universe of telecom assets, verify the accuracy of 
monthly bills, and/or allocate costs to specific divisions or users.  We note that carriers 
often issue statements in different formats, currencies, and languages, adding to this 
complexity. 

A simple example can help illustrate one of the many benefits of a CLM solution.  Many 
enterprises issue company-owned cell phones/smartphones to employees (or support 
bring-your-own-device programs) from a variety of carriers, each with a unique set of 
service options, contracts, and billing arrangements.  Besides the complexities associated 
with trying to manage the sheer volume of monthly bills, Tangoe believes that 25% of bills 
have errors that result in overcharges of ~4-8%.  Further, since voice/data plans are not 
always optimized for actual monthly usage, employers may overpay for high minute/data 
packages that go unused or conversely pay for overages as employees blow through their 
minutes or roam when traveling internationally.  Without a centralized solution, companies 
quite often do not have visibility into whether or not they are paying for access to devices 
assigned to inactive or terminated employees.  While this is just one example, it quickly 
distills the value and potential ROI benefits that a CLM solution can provide. 

Risk and policy management is increasing in importance.  Separately, as companies 
continue to add support for newer mobile devices to their network, it has become more 
difficult, yet increasingly more important, to protect confidential information and manage 
compliance with government/industry regulations or internal policies.  For example, 
several countries (such as Germany, Portugal, and Spain) require that invoices be 
encrypted and/or identifying data redacted prior to transmission outside of the country (we 
note that Tangoe has 88 global invoice processing centers to adhere to regulatory 
compliance).  Further, companies must be able to remotely monitor devices for 
compliance or “kill” devices should they be lost or stolen.  Mobile device support is only 
beginning to mature, with Gartner expecting 80% of enterprises to support tablets by 
2013.  Therefore, we believe that efficient corporate governance requires a centralized 
and automated solution to ensure regulatory requirements with laws and policies. 

Putting this all together, enterprises (especially multinational organizations) can no 
longer afford to go without a holistic view of their fixed/mobile assets and accompanying 

                                                                                          7

Tangoe

                                             expenses, especially given increasing spend per year.  As mobile devices enter the 
                                             workplace at escalating rates, organizations need to enforce compliance and manage the 
                                             security risks that accompany these devices.  Therefore, we believe that the 
                                             aforementioned industry trends favor adoption of third-party CLM solutions over home-
                                             grown systems, and Tangoe is well positioned to be a formidable candidate at the RFP 
                                             table.

                                                      Tangoe’s growth drivers, healthy fundamentals, and market leadership lead us to 

                                                      believe Tangoe’s shares should outperform the broader markets over the next 12-18 

                                                      months.  At current levels, Tangoe‟s stock trades at 3.4x our CY12 recurring revenue 

                                                      projection of $107.5M and is attractively priced, in our view.  We note Tangoe trades at a 

                                                      discount to the SaaS group, which currently trades at 4.3x CY12E recurring revenue.  

                                                      Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS company, as its MDM product is still delivered 

                                                      via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution.  However, Tangoe‟s flagship CMP 

                                                      suite is currently offered on-demand, and the company expects to migrate the MDM 

                                                      product to an SaaS architecture by the end of next year.  Given the company's growth 

                                                      prospects, solid revenue visibility, and leverage in the model, we believe it should trade in 

                                                      line with its peers.  As a result, we apply a 4.1x CY12 recurring revenue multiple to arrive 

                                                      at our $14 price target. 

                                                      The company‟s stage in its lifecycle, healthy organic growth (we expect the company to 

                                                      deliver at least 15-20% organic recurring revenue growth for the foreseeable future), 

                                                      positive acquisitive track record, and solid revenue visibility (~90% of revenues are 

                                                      recurring) lead us to believe that traditional P/E and cash flow-based valuation methods 

                                                      are less appropriate measures to value Tangoe‟s shares.  Instead, we believe that 

                                                      EV/recurring revenue is a more appropriate way to value the company and expect that 

                                                      EV/FCF will likely be another viable metric to value the company as it matures.

Tangoe

                                            Company Background 

                                            Tangoe is a leading provider of CLM solutions, a segment of the software market focused 
                                            on managing the lifecycle of an enterprise‟s communications assets and services.  As 
                                            defined by Tangoe, CLM encompasses fixed and mobile planning and sourcing, 
                                            procurement and provisioning, inventory and usage management, invoice processing, 
                                            expense allocation and accounting, and asset decommissioning and disposal.  Tangoe‟s 
                                            primary offering, the communications management platform (CMP), is an SaaS-based 
                                            solution used to manage fixed and mobile communications assets and services.  Broadly 
                                            speaking, the two primary sub-sectors within the CLM universe are telecommunications 
                                            expense management (TEM) and mobile device management (MDM).  We note that 
                                            through a history of acquisitions and internal developments, Tangoe became one of the 
                                            first providers to integrate fixed and mobile CLM solutions as well as TEM and MDM 
                                            solutions in one platform.  As a result, Tangoe maintains a leadership position and offers 
                                            one of the most comprehensive CLM suites in the market.  The company believes it is 
                                            over three times larger than its nearest competitor.     

                                            Founded in 2000, Tangoe is headquartered in Orange, CT.  The company employs over 
                                            750 people across global offices including the United States, Amsterdam, and China 
                                            (Tangoe serves the Latin American market through local partners) and manages ~$14.5B 
                                            of the estimated ~$425B in fixed and mobile communications spend per year along with 
                                            over 1.7M mobile devices.  About ~50% of revenues is fixed TEM, ~40% is mobile 
                                            TEM/MDM, with the remaining ~10% coming from strategic consulting.  While MDM deal 
                                            sizes are typically smaller than TEM deals, we believe MDM represents an emerging 
                                            market and expect it will continue to grow from the less than 10% of total revenues it 
                                            comprises today.   

                                            Tangoe boasts of servicing over 615 end customers ranging from small companies with 
                                            150 employees to multinational corporations with over 350,000 employees.  While Tangoe 
                                            is not particularly levered to any one vertical, we note that technology and 
                                            finance/insurance each comprise approximately 15-20% of total revenue.  No single end 
                                            customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue from 2008 to 2010.  We note that 
                                            Tangoe typically adds 20-30 new customers a quarter.

Product Offering    

The Communications Management Platform is an SaaS-based solution that is offered on 
a subscription basis (with contracts that range from 24 to 60 months) and manages the 
lifecycle of fixed and mobile communications assets and services.  CLM integrates with 
leading ERP products such as SAP or Oracle to synch employee, accounting, user access 
authentication, and security policy information.  For those companies interested in 
outsourcing aspects of telecom management, Tangoe offers help desk, asset 
procurement and provisioning, and carrier dispute resolution through its Client Services 
Group.   

Tangoe’s CLM suite is both flexible and scalable, enabling the company to support 
smaller installations through global deployments.  About $3.5B of Tangoe‟s ~$14.5B 
managed spend is international, and the solution supports 16 languages, 125 currencies, 
200 countries/territories, and 1,900 billing formats for 1,700 carriers globally.  With support 
for 63 global regulatory bodies, coupled with holding 12 patents (and seven more 
pending), we believe Tangoe has created a sizable moat vis-à-vis its competitors. 

Tangoe offers CLM solutions in three base packages which can be sold separately or 
bundled together.  These packages include standard capabilities as well as the ability to 
add-on functionality.  The following is a brief overview of the three packages: 

       Asset Management – manages asset procurement, provisioning, tracking, and 
        disposal capabilities for fixed and mobile communications assets and services.  
        In particular, it provides: 

             o   Catalog Management – catalog communications services, devices, 
                 features, and plans 

             o   Procure – enforce workflow management capabilities to request and 
                 approve fixed/mobile service and equipment orders 

             o   Provision – use over-the-air (OTA) provisioning to configure mobile 
                 devices (with usage/security policies) and install corporate applications 

             o   Track – track communications assets including configuration, 
                 ownership, and operational/connectivity status  

             o   Maintain – deploy usage/security policies and updates to mobile devices 

             o   Dispose – erase and dispose of mobile devices 

     

       Expense Management – manages the lifecycle of fixed and mobile 
        communications billings.  In particular, it provides: 

             o   Contract Management – a central repository to manage contracts and 
                 agreements 

             o   Billing – import service and equipment bills into a centralized repository 

             o   Audit – evaluate billing data against contracts (rates, terms) and asset

             o   Dispute – dispute and track billing, service, and asset exceptions with 
                 carriers/providers 

             o   Allocate – allocate expenses to business units, cost centers, and 
                 employees 

             o   Payment – automatically pay invoices (directly to vendor or feed A/P 
                 systems) based on predefined business rules 

             o   Optimize – evaluate contracts against actual usage to optimize billing 
                 contracts/plans 

     

                                                                                        11

                                                                                       234

Tangoe

                                                      Usage Management – monitors (real-time and historical) fixed/mobile 
                                                       communications asset usage and compliance with corporate security policies.  In 
                                                       particular, it provides: 

                                                            o   Secure – delete data from and disable mobile devices 

                                                            o   Policy Management – define security and usage policies 

                                                            o   Monitor – monitor device usage for problem identification, fraud 
                                                                detection, and misuse of services 

                                                            o   Real-Time – monitor device-level usage costs to identify usages in 
                                                                violation of corporate policy or expenses related to roaming charges 

                                                            o   Compliance – enforce usage policies to limit functionality and track non-
                                                                compliant behavior 

                                                            o   Performance – monitor/manage wireless server infrastructure 
                                                                performance and mobile device configurations 

                                                            o   Support – provide mobile device support capabilities on a stand-alone 
                                                                basis or in conjunction with an existing corporate help desk 

                                                    

                                              While Tangoe‟s main revenue driver is recurring subscription revenue (which comprises 
                                              ~90% of total revenues), we note the company also offers strategic consulting services 
                                              including sourcing (review and negotiate contracts with carriers), bill auditing (identify 
                                              billing errors), inventory optimization (align assets with business need), mobile 
                                              optimization (optimize mobile policies/assets/contracts with business need), and policy 
                                              administration (develop enterprise policies for communications assets and services). 

                                              Tangoe sees a large and growing opportunity in the TEM/MDM space, and we expect 
                                              the firm to devote the majority of its sales and marketing resources toward growing the 
                                              recurring revenue side of the house.  While the strategic consulting business is still 
                                              important to Tangoe, we do not expect the firm to actively grow this segment of the

Business Model 

Tangoe‟s TEM product is primarily delivered as an on-demand solution, whereas its MDM 
product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or on-premise solution (we note that Tangoe 
expects to migrate the MDM product to a SaaS architecture by the end of next year).  The 
firm has good visibility into its revenue stream each quarter, with about 90% of revenues 
recurring and the remaining coming from consulting and software licenses.  Tangoe‟s 
business model has proven to be relatively stable, as evidenced by over 20% recurring 
revenue growth during the „08/‟09 recession.  We note that Tangoe bills clients on a 
monthly basis.    

Tangoe‟s revenue model is levered to the dollar amount of communications spend 
managed (for fixed line contracts), number of devices managed (for mobile device 
contracts), and add-on functionality/services.  ASPs run north of $175K, with the top 100 
accounts averaging $574K.  MDM ASPs are lower than for TEM, which we expect to rise 
and which should help drive ASPs higher over the next few years.  About ~50% of 
revenues is fixed TEM, ~40% is mobile TEM/MDM, with the remaining ~10% coming from 
strategic consulting.  While MDM deal sizes are typically smaller than TEM deals, we 
believe MDM represents an emerging market and expect it will continue to grow from the 
less than 10% of total revenues it comprises today.     

Tangoe‟s target market ranges from small companies with several million dollars in 
telecom spend through multinational enterprises with over one billion dollars in telecom 
spend.  Contracts run for 24-60 months (with a typical contract averaging runs for 24-36 
months), and we note that Tangoe‟s customer base is pretty “sticky,” with retention rates 
in the mid-90s. 

Tangoe‟s quota-carrying sales team is compensated on annual recurring revenue added, 
which aligns the sales force with the firm‟s desire to drive sales in new accounts as well as 
penetrate existing accounts for incremental revenue opportunities.  While the sales cycle 
typically ranges from six to nine months, we note Tangoe can roll out a new 
implementation within 60-90 days. 

Tangoe sees a large and growing opportunity in the TEM/MDM space, and we expect the 
firm to devote the majority of its sales and marketing resources toward growing the 
recurring revenue side of the house.  While the strategic consulting business is still 
important to Tangoe, we do not expect the firm to actively grow this segment of the 
business and believe it will hover around 10% of revenues over the near term.   

As an aside, management disclosed that billings is not a metric that the company focuses 
on and believes it is a less important metric for Tangoe than it may be for other SaaS 
companies.  For example, while contracts run 24-60 months, Tangoe bills clients on a 
monthly basis and not one year (or more) in advance like other SaaS shops may.  
Second, much of Tangoe‟s deferred revenue makeup is related to legacy maintenance 
contracts (which is amortized annually) and will not be replenished with subscription 
contracts due to Tangoe‟s transition to a pure-SaaS shop.

                                             Recent Acquisitions & Strategic Alliances 

                                             Tangoe is not afraid to acquire technology, clients, and/or geographic presence.  
                                             Through much of its history, Tangoe has used acquisitions to augment its organic growth.  
                                             Over the past four years, Tangoe acquired five companies in order to obtain new 
                                             technology, grow its customer base, and extend its geographic reach.  Overall, these 
                                             deals allowed the firm to develop and integrate a holistic CLM offering and up-sell/cross-
                                             sell its combined CLM suite to a larger installed base.  We expect Tangoe to continue to 
                                             engage in tuck-in acquisitions over the next few years in order to continue scaling along 
                                             these three axes.  While Tangoe prefers cash-based deals, we note that management is 
                                             not averse to stock-based transactions. 

                                             Through these acquisitions and internal developments, Tangoe became one of the first 
                                             providers to integrate fixed and mobile CLM solutions as well as TEM and MDM solutions 
                                             in one platform.  The following section briefly highlights Tangoe‟s recent acquisition 
                                             history:     

                                                Telwares, Inc. – On March 16, 2011, Tangoe acquired Telwares‟ TEM business for 
                                                 $4.5M (with deferred cash payments of an additional $2.5M).  Through this 
                                                 acquisition, Tangoe extended its fixed/mobile capabilities by acquiring invoice 
                                                 management, call accounting, and MDM operations.  We note Telwares had ~75 
                                                 TEM customers that should contribute ~$8M in revenues during 2011.  Additionally, 
                                                 we expect Tangoe to migrate existing Telwares customers to Tangoe solutions over 
                                                 the next 12-18 months. 

                                                HCL Technologies – On January 25, 2011, Tangoe acquired HCL Technologies‟ 
                                                 Expense Management Services Inc. (HCL EMS) for $3M (with earnout payments of 
                                                 up to $3.4M).  Through this acquisition, Tangoe acquired TEM, invoice processing, 
                                                 and mobility management solutions.  We note that HCL had ~40 TEM customers that 
                                                 should generate ~$10M in revenues during 2011.  Additionally, we expect Tangoe to 
                                                 migrate existing HCL customers to Tangoe solutions over the next 12-18 months.   

                                                InterNoded, Inc. – On December 23, 2008, Tangoe acquired InterNoded, Inc., a 
                                                 provider of MDM solutions, for $3.3M.  Through this acquisition, Tangoe obtained 
                                                 MDM technology capabilities which enabled the firm to offer an integrated TEM and 
                                                 MDM solution.  

                                                Information Strategies Group, Inc. (ISG) – On July 28, 2008, Tangoe acquired ISG, 
                                                 a provider of telecom and IT expense processing services and technologies, for 
                                                 $11.9M.  Through this acquisition, Tangoe added international capabilities, acquired 
                                                 call accounting and bill chargeback/allocation technology, and grew its customer 
                                                 base. 

                                                TRAQ Wireless, Inc. – On March 9, 2007, Tangoe acquired TRAQ Wireless, Inc., a 
                                                 provider of mobile lifecycle management solutions, for $20.7M.  Through this 
                                                 acquisition, Tangoe acquired wireless expense management technology capabilities 
                                                 which enabled the firm to offer an integrated fixed and mobile TEM solution. 

                                             Expect Margin Expansion Over Time.  Tangoe delivered gross margins of 56.3% and 
                                             55.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We expect gross margins to trend down over 200 
                                             bps (to approximately 53%) in 2011 while the company digests the Telwares and HCL 
                                             acquisitions (HCL and Telwares have typically operated at lower margin structures).  We 
                                             note these integrations are on track and expect margins to increase back to 56% next 
                                             year as Tangoe fully integrates these purchases.  Over time (i.e., ~ three to five years), we 
                                             expect gross margins to trend higher toward management‟s long-term target of 61-63%.

                                                                                     Tangoe

Due to the large and growing market opportunity, we agree with the company‟s investment 
in R&D and S&M.  Despite these investments, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin (a 
metric used by Tangoe management) to come in at the mid-11% range in 2011 
(increasing from 10.0% and 7.8% in 2010 and 2009, respectively) and believe it should 
steadily increase toward the company‟s long-term target of 24-26% as the business gains 
critical mass. 

Strategic Alliances a Key Part of Tangoe’s Growth Strategy.  In addition to its direct 
sales efforts, Tangoe formed ~20 strategic alliances with a variety of channel 
partners/resellers including ACS, Dell, HCL, and IBM.  These partners enable Tangoe to 
extend its reach in the marketplace by reselling or white-labeling Tangoe‟s CLM solutions.  
Partners often perform lead generation, sales, and ongoing management of customer 
accounts.  They can also provide implementation and consulting services related to the 
solution, branded as being provided by the partner itself.   

Strategic alliances contribute approximately 25% to Tangoe‟s new sales, with the IBM 
relationship alone accounting for revenues of 10.6% and 11.8% in 2010 and 2009, 
respectively.  The IBM relationship is the most mature relationship, and Dell is one of the 
newest (formed in March 2011).  While Tangoe does not have exclusive relationships with 
its strategic partners, management discloses that Tangoe is entrenched with these 
companies due to the complexity surrounding CLM solutions (e.g., partners need to have 
intimate knowledge of the CLM product to sell, implement, and support it, and it is often 
difficult to maintain such expertise across a variety of solutions).  Further, Tangoe issued 
common stock warrants to IBM and Dell that should incentivize them to actively sell its 
solution.  Separately, Gartner notes that Tangoe‟s partner revenues alone outpace the 
total revenues of other TEM players. 

Management notes that gross margins for partner sales are roughly consistent with direct 
sales as partners typically mark up the offerings to their clients.  In order to continue 
expanding its market reach, we expect Tangoe to add one to two strategic relationships 
with business process outsourcing firms and system integrators over the next 12-24 
months.  

                                                                                         15

                                            Recent Results 

                                            Delivers solid 2Q11.  Tangoe released its 2Q11 quarterly results (its last complete 
                                            quarter as a private company) on August 23, 2011, that were in line with the company‟s 
                                            preliminary results provided in the S-1.  Overall, Tangoe delivered solid results across the 
                                            board and posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 on revenue of $26.0M, up 56% Y/Y and in line 
                                            with our estimates of $0.06 on revenue of $25.5M.  The results were led by healthy 
                                            recurring revenue growth, up 69% Y/Y to $23.5M from $13.9M.  Tangoe delivered organic 
                                            recurring revenue growth of 28% for 2Q11 and for 1H11, and recurring revenue comprised 
                                            90% of total revenue for the quarter (up from 83% in 2Q10 and 89% in 1Q11).  Last, 
                                            Tangoe posted adjusted EBITDA of $3.1M, up 90% Y/Y from $1.6M. 

                                            No signs of a slowdown.  Management highlighted it has not seen any impact to its 
                                            business from macro headwinds and notes its pipelines are strong and growing.  Recall 
                                            that Tangoe experienced solid demand during the last recession, as recurring revenue 
                                            grew over 20% (and against plan) during the „08/‟09 downturn.  Since that time, Tangoe‟s 
                                            value proposition has become even more attractive, as it now offers TEM and MDM in one 
                                            solution.   

                                            Customer retention rates are in the mid-90s, and the company added 25 new customers 
                                            during the quarter (it typically adds 20-30 a quarter).  Additionally, Tangoe rolled out the 
                                            latest version of its MDM suite, which contained device and application security 
                                            enhancements for Apple iOS and Android operating systems. 

                                            Acquisitions are on track.  Management highlighted that the HCL and Telwares 
                                            acquisitions are on track, and the company expects to complete the migrations over the 
                                            next 12-18 months.  We believe the company is ready to digest its next acquisition should 
                                            the opportunity for an acquisition present itself. 

                                            Issues 3Q11 and FY11 guidance.  Looking ahead, management expects 3Q11 non-
                                            GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.06/$26.3-26.7M.  The company also expects adjusted 
                                            EBITDA of $3-3.2M and 35.1M shares outstanding.  For FY11, the company now expects 
                                            non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.24-0.25/$101.4-102.2M.  The company also expects 
                                            adjusted EBITDA of $11.8-12.2M, 33.3M shares outstanding, and a tax rate of 8%.  
                                            Longer term, management is targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24-26%. 

                                            Strong execution and good visibility should lead to upside.  Based on Tangoe‟s 
                                            strong growth during 1H11, visibility into future revenue, business momentum, market 
                                            opportunity and increasing market awareness, and healthy balance sheet post-IPO, we 
                                            believe the company is poised to deliver a strong second half of the fiscal year and can 
                                            deliver at least 15-20% organic recurring revenue growth for the foreseeable future.  
                                            Altogether, we expect non-GAAP EPS/revenue of $0.06/$26.5M and $0.25/$102.0M for 
                                            3Q11 and FY11, respectively.

Competitive Landscape    

The CLM marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive, with competitors ranging 
from in-house solutions to third-party providers.  Often, in-house solutions are 
immature/manual in nature and do not offer the functionality, scalability, or productivity 
gains offered by Tangoe‟s CLM platform.  While third-party providers offer capable 
solutions, we note that they are point solutions and are not a complete fixed/mobile TEM 
and MDM suite.  As discussed in the “Recent Acquisitions & Strategic Alliances” section, 
business process outsourcing (BPO) firms and system integrators typically do not have a 
CLM solution of their own, and Tangoe believes there are opportunities to form additional 
strategic alliances similar to its partnerships with ACS, Dell, HCL, and IBM.   

The CLM industry has undergone a considerable amount of consolidation over the 
past few years.  Tangoe acquired five companies over the last four years alone, of which 
two (HCL, Telwares) were completed earlier this year (see “Recent Acquisitions & 
Strategic Alliances” for more information).  Other examples of M&A activity include 
Emptoris‟s acquisition of Rivermine in January 2011 and Vodafone‟s acquisition of TnT 
Expense Management and Quickcomm in October 2010.  Despite competitor acquisitions, 
Tangoe manages more fixed/mobile communications spend per year than any other IT 
and process outsourcing company.

We believe that Tangoe competes successfully in each of the aforementioned 
categories.  And unlike many of its competitors, Tangoe offers a complete suite of 
integrated fixed and mobile TEM/MDM solutions and can also boast of a diverse customer 
base.  Over time, we expect that competitors will ramp the quality and breadth of their 
CLM offerings, and we anticipate further consolidation as firms jockey to gain market 
share.

                                              Investment Risks 

                                              Although there are a variety of investment risks associated with investing in Tangoe, we 
                                              highlight our biggest concerns below: 

                                              History of losses.  Tangoe has a history of GAAP losses since its founding in 2000.  
                                              However, revenue has been growing steadily during this time, signaling the company‟s  
                                              reinvestment strategy is paying off.  While Tangoe is still not profitable on a GAAP basis, 
                                              we note that it has been adjusted EBITDA positive since 3Q08.  Additionally, Tangoe has 
                                              delivered positive net income on a non-GAAP basis since 2Q09, most recently at $1.7M in 
                                              2Q11.   

                                              CLM demand may not materialize.  The market for third-party CLM solutions is nascent, 
                                              and Tangoe expects it to continue growing over the next several years.  Due to macro 
                                              uncertainties, improvements in home-grown solutions, or simply a lack of awareness, the 
                                              demand for third-party CLM offerings (both domestically and internationally) may not 
                                              blossom as expected.  That said, Tangoe‟s business model has proven to be surprisingly 
                                              stable during previous periods of economic uncertainty, as recurring revenue grew over 
                                              20% (and against plan) during the „08/‟09 downturn.   

                                              Strategic alliances break down.  A pillar of Tangoe‟s growth strategy is its formation of 
                                              strategic alliances with channel partners/resellers including ACS, Dell, HCL, and IBM.  
                                              Several relationships were formed recently (for example, with Dell in March 2011) and 
                                              may not develop as expected.  Additionally, channel partners may choose to collaborate 
                                              more with Tangoe‟s competitors should they offer better contract terms or improve their 
                                              CLM solutions.  As a result, Tangoe‟s top line and bottom line could be significantly 
                                              impacted should it lose channel partners, partners do not deliver products/services 
                                              according to Tangoe‟s standards, alliances do not grow as expected, or indirect channel 
                                              margins deteriorate. 

                                              M&A activity or consolidation could negatively impact the company.  Tangoe 
                                              operates in a fragmented and competitive industry.  Over the past several years, 
                                              consolidation has been a key theme in the CLM space which we do not expect to change 
                                              over the near term.  While Tangoe has been a successful acquirer (closing five 
                                              acquisitions in the past four years), M&A represents a threat both internally (should 
                                              Tangoe fail to successfully integrate a target post-acquisition) and externally (should 
                                              competitors improve offerings/reduce pricing, resulting in customer losses or renegotiated 
                                              contracts).  Regarding the internal threat, we note that Tangoe has demonstrated skill in 
                                              successfully integrating targets upon acquisition. 

                                              Intensifying competition.  While Tangoe is a leading provider of CLM software and 
                                              services, the space is evolving.  Should other vendors with greater resources or brand 
                                              recognition decide to enter the market, Tangoe‟s standing in the marketplace could be 
                                              materially impaired.

Investment Thesis
n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
n  Largest player in a multibillion-dollar market that continues to grow
n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
   expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
n  Leverage in the model

Price Target Calculation
We arrive at our $14 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.1x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $107.5M. We note the SaaS
peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a pure SaaS-only shop (its
MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to SaaS architecture by end of
next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the "stickiness" of its installed
base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,  subscriptions  model),  its  robust  growth  rates  (40%  five-year  CAGR),
market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with
its peers, which leads us to our $14 price target.

Key Risks to Price Target
There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
price target.
