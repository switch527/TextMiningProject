                            services will transition to TNAV brand over time, meaning that new subs and

                            branded one. While this may indicate that Sprints commitment to TNAV 
                            solution is moderating, it also yields TNAV the opportunity to establish its own

                                       slightly below expectations.  The company looks for F1Q11 PF EPS of $0.23 on

                                       PF EPS is expected to be in the range $0.55-$0.60 on revenue of $180-$185mm

                                       additional information to build precise  subscription (now subscription and fixed 
                                       fee) and advertising revenue forecasts.  For the time being, we have assumed 
                                       conservative FY11 and FY12 growth rates (6% and 3% respectively) on the 
                                       overall revenue, and aligned our PF EPS estimates with management guidance.

                                       MRM and Mobile Advertising segments,   we will provide a more detailed and 
                                       precise revenue model. We are now modeling FY11 PF EPS of $0.57 on revenue 
                                       of $182.2mm, PF EBITDA $48.4mm, FY12 PF EPS of $0.49 on revenue of

                                       prospects associated with navigation and LB S solutions are offset by the risks of

                                     Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                     Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                     mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months. Long-term growth prospects 
                                     associated with navigation and LBS solutions are now offset by the risks of pricing 
                                     pressure at key customers, spurred by the availability of 'free' solutions from Nokia 
                                     and Google. 

                                     December 31, 2011 price target is $7.00.  The Price Target is based on an assigned 
                                     multiple of 7 (previously 6 times) revised CY12E PF EBITDA of $61.9 million; the 
                                     multiple is based on the comms software/services peer group multiple. We have 
                                     increased the multiple by one turn to reflect the reduced risk profile for the stock. 
                                     The market cap takes into consideration $112mm in cash, and zero debt. We use 45.5 
                                     million shares to calculate our per-share price target. 

                                     Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                     We could become more constructive on TNAV's prospects for any of the 
                                     following reasons: 
                                         •   Negotations with Sprint conclude with more favorable pricing terms than 
                                             we have assumed. 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   "Free" navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                     We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                     reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or negotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll-over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or  reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  
                                         •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                         •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                         •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not happen. 

                                                                                                                      3

                                            •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                                 leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying
