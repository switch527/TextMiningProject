Company Description: 
The Chefs' Warehouse is a leading distributor of specialt y food products in many key culinary markets in the 
United States. The company's core customers are chefs at leading independent restaurants and fine-dining 
establishments, as well as country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, and specialty food stores. The 
company distributes more than 11,500 food products, incl uding an extensive selection of distinctive and hard-
to-find specialty items, to over 7,000 customer locations in the United States. 
 
Discussion 
 
On October 27, The Chefs Warehouse posted Q3 2011 modified pro forma EPS of $0.19, which was above our 
estimate of $0.18 and versus $0.17 last year.  Relative to our target, the earnings upside mainly reflected higher 
than expected sales growth in the period.  On a GAAP    basis, the company reported a Q3 loss per share of 
$0.06, which included financing, tran saction, and other costs related to th e companys initial public offering 
completed in the quarter.  Management also noted that Hurricane Irene negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 in 
the quarter. 
 
Revenue increased 19.7% to $101.7 million versus our $98. 5 million target and $84.9 million last year.  Of the 
19.7% in revenue growth, 6.4% was from the Harry Wi     ls acquisition, and 2.7%  was from product mix and 
inflation, leaving real (organic) growth of 10.6%.     We are particularly impressed by these topline 
results, as we had been targeting organic growth of 7.5%.  Gross Profit margin was 26.2% versus our 
26.0% estimate and 26.0% last year, while operating income margin came in at 6.9% versus our 6.8% estimate 
and 6.9% last year.  
 
In terms of recent trends, management noted on the earnings conference call that the companys key metrics, 
such as new customers and product placements, continue  to reach all-time highs.   Management also indicated 
that their high-end restaurant customers appear to be holding up well in the current environment.  
 
We were encouraged to hear that the Harry   Wils acquisition appears to be performing well.   
Management decided to increase fleet  and staff support in Q3 to ensure  customer service was maintained to 
standard during the integration process.  The company gained over 500 new customers in New York over a 
short period of time with the acquisition and thought that it was a good investment to increase fleet capacity by 
30% to ensure customer satisfaction. Management has   since begun to pare back on the fleet additions and 
hopes to reduce the recent fleet additions by about half to a more normalized level. 
 
Key Growth Strategies.  The companys growth strategies are comprised of three key elements:  continue to 
pursue organic growth opportunities, further improve operating margins and target selective acquisitions.  We 
think The Chefs Warehouse has the potential to increase business with existing customers through expanded 
product selection, particularly the number of unique offerings. Management believes they are the primary 
distributor of specialty items for the majority of thei r customers and management  is focused on maintaining 
this position while working to become the primary specialt y distributor for a larger portion of their customers.  
We also think the company has the opportunity to       enhance their distribution network by adding new 
customers in existing markets.  We   think the companys combination of   traditional and specialty product 
offerings coupled with their ability to cultivate strong customer relationships should enable The Chefs 
Warehouse to continue to expand their customer base within existing markets. The organic growth 
opportunities, if successful, should enhance the oper  ating margin by leveraging   economies of scale in 
purchasing, warehousing, distribution and when combined with fixed cost leverage should result in improved 
profitability.  We also think opportunities exist within  the highly fragmented foodservice distribution industry 
for The Chefs Warehouse to pursue selective acquisitio ns which have the potential to expand the breadth of 
the companys distribution network, and further enhance operating efficiencies as well as product offerings 
and other capabilities.   
 
Company guidance.  Management reiterated FY2011 guidance  of modified pro forma EPS of $0.76-0.79, 
based in part on revenue of $384-$392 million.     Management also noted that their guidance range now 
includes a $0.01 negative impact from Hurricane Iren e and a $0.01 negative impact from the Harry Wils 
transition, neither of which it included previously.    On a reported basis, 2011 EPS is expected to be $0.41-
0.42.  In addition, the effective tax rate for the year is  expected to be 39%, and diluted shares outstanding are 
expected to be 20.8 million.   
 
Raising EPS Estimates.   We are raising our 2011 EPS estimate to $0.77 from $0.76 and our 2012 EPS 
estimate to $0.98 from $0.97, both of which reflect th e Q3 2011 earnings upside.  We note that with the Q3 
revenue upside, our 2011 revenue target is above managements guidance range.

The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.                                                                               EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

We continue to think that The Chefs Warehouse is well-positioned to generate EPS growth of approximately 
17% over the next 3-5 years annually. Our longer-term 3-5 year EPS growth rate is based in part on 7-10% real 
or organic sales growth, relatively consistent gross margins, and some leverage on the operating expense and 
interest expense lines.  We also think that selectiv           e acquisitions could further enhance the companys long-
term growth rate. 
 
Rating & Valuation.   We are maintaining our Outperform rating on CHEF shares, which reflects current 
valuation as well as our favorable view of the comp                 anys competitive positionin g within the foodservice 
distribution industry.  We believe that CHEF is poised  for growth given the companys presence in key culinary 
markets combined with their customer focus on serving the needs of chefs at independent restaurants and 
their product focus of sourcing specia lty food offerings.  We also think   that the companys growth potential 
could be further enhanced through sele ctive acquisition opportunities.  CH EF shares are trading at 14.2x our 
2012 EPS estimate versus a multiple of 16.0x for the peer group and our estimated 3-5 year growth rate of 17%. 
On a P/E-to-growth basis, CHEF shares are trading at a multiple of 0.8x versus a peer group PEG ratio of 1.6x. 
Over the next twelve months, we believe that CHEF shares may warrant a valuation range of $19-20 based on a 
multiple of 19-20x our FY2012 EPS es  timate. In our view, key risk factors that could affect share valuation 
include the inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, sales and commodity volatility, challenges related to 
sourcing products, and risks related to their geographic concentration.
