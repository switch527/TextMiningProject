                                              Investment Considerations 

                                               
                                              Exposure to Highly Desirable Bakken Infrastructure. TLLP’s High Plains system 
                                              connects the Bakken/Williston oil-producing area to Tesoro’s Mandan refinery—the 
                                              closest refinery to the Bakken oil fields. We believe that Mandan is one of the lowest-cost 
                                              options for Williston basin producers to get crude oil to market. While High Plains has 
                                              historically delivered volumes exclusively to the refinery, the intention now is to open it up 
                                              to third parties via connections to five different transportation pipelines. This should result 
                                              in higher utilization of the gathering system and allow for increased gathering activity as 
                                              drilling grows. We believe TLLP (through the High Plains system) provides unitholders 
                                              with the opportunity to invest in a scalable, profitable crude gathering system in one of the 
                                              fastest growing oil plays in the US. 
                                               
                                              Attractive Organic Growth Prospects. The purpose of separating TLLP from TSO was 
                                              to create an independent entity that exists to maximize the value of TSO’s midstream 
                                              assets. The asset base was historically utilized exclusively by its parent company. We 
                                              believe there is ample opportunity to increase utilization by allowing third parties access to 
                                              the assets. In addition, the company has already announced several small, highly 
                                              accretive growth projects designed to provide incremental services to the expanded 
                                              customer base. We anticipate these accretive projects to continue as TLLP establishes 
                                              itself as a new, independent entity. 
                                               
                                              Ample Dropdown Growth Available from Tesoro. TLLP’s relationship with Tesoro 
                                              Corp. (TSO) should provide opportunities for dropdown asset acquisitions. TLLP has 
                                              rights of first refusal on ten TSO assets should the parent decide to sell, transfer or 
                                              dispose of the assets. We estimate the potential dollar amount of growth projects from 
                                              TSO to be approximately $600-800M. We believe dropdowns from the parent will provide 
                                              the opportunity to grow TLLP substantially over time. We estimate that each $100M of 
                                              acquisitions completed by TLLP will result in approximately 6% DCFPU accretion 
                                              (assuming a 10x EBITDA multiple). As a result of the ownership of the general partner, 
                                              TSO has the incentive to promote growth at TLLP. TSO will receive an increasing 
                                              percentage of incremental distributions paid by TLLP as the MLP grows. Therefore, we 
                                              feel TLLP will benefit greatly from dropdown growth.   
                                               
                                              Low Financial Leverage Provides Flexibility to Acquire.  TLLP has relatively low 
                                              financial leverage with an estimated debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3x. Total debt outstanding 
                                              post-IPO is $50M and is being carried on the company’s $150M revolving credit facility. 
                                              This financial flexibility offers TLLP the opportunity to acquire assets and grow 
                                              distributable cash flow. We estimate that the first $200M of acquisitions can be completed 
                                              without issuing additional equity. That would leave the debt/EBITDA ratio at approximately 
                                              3.5x. 
                                               
                                              100% Fee-Based Cash Flows Backed by Long-Term Contracts. TLLP generates 100% 
                                              fee-based cash flows. The majority are backed by 10-year contracts with minimum volume 
                                              commitments. These contracts effectively remove cyclicality of the refining business from 
                                              TLLP’s cash flows. We believe that the long-term fee-based nature of TLLP’s business 
                                              model provides the stability and transparency necessary to pay consistent distributions.   
                                               
                                              Tariff Escalation: Interstate crude oil pipelines that are not located near competing 
                                              pipelines receive a FERC-regulated “indexed” tariff to mitigate market power. That tariff 
                                              increases or decreases based on the Producer Price Index (PPI; finished goods) plus an 
                                              escalator derived by the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). For the five 
                                              years ended June 30, 2011, the escalator is +1.3%. For example, in 2010, the projected 
                                              PPI is 4.28%. Add the 1.3% escalator and we get 5.58%. Indexed tariffs increase by 
                                              5.58% starting July 1, 2010. In addition, the FERC has recently finished its new five-year 
                                              review of the escalator and will implement PPI + 2.65% for the five years ended June 30,

2016. Even in an environment of slow economic growth and inflation (assume the PPI 
increases 2% in 2011), we will have mid-single-digit annual tariff increases on the High 
Plains system. 
 
Downside Protection from Unit Subordination: TLLP’s subordination structure provides 
some downside protection to common unitholders in the event that the company is unable 
to pay its minimum quarterly distribution (MQD). It also provides management an incentive 
to achieve stated financial goals. Approximately 49% of TLLP’s total units outstanding are 
subordinated. The 15.3M subordinated units are owned by TSO. In the case that TLLP is 
unable to pay the MQD of $0.3375 per quarter on all outstanding units, common units 
have the right to receive distributions of $0.3375 plus any arrearages before any 
payments may be made on the subordinated units. In addition, the subordination period 
will end (and the subordinated units will convert to common units), when a certain set of 
financial goals is achieved related to distribution payment and growth.  
 

Investment Risks 

 
Tesoro Credit and Concentration Risk.  TLLP’s current business model is heavily tied to 
Tesoro. Historically, TSO has been the only customer for TLLP’s assets and it will 
continue to contribute the majority of its cash flows into the future. We are confident that 
TLLP will expand its customer base to include third parties over time, but TSO will always 
play an important role in TLLP’s success. TLLP enjoys minimum volume commitments on 
the 10-year contracts it has with TSO which insulate it from the ups and downs of the 
refining business cycle. However, if TSO becomes insolvent for any reason, TLLP will be 
exposed. 
 
Refined Product Demand. The recent rise in crude oil prices has resulted in high profit 
margins for producers in the Williston basin. However, it has also resulted in higher 
gasoline and other refined product prices. Should crude oil and refined product prices 
continue to rise, this may lead to a demand response. In other words, it may erode refined 
product demand. TLLP’s infrastructure was built to support Tesoro’s refineries. Should 
demand for refined products decline, utilization of TLLP’s assets may fall. TLLP’s long-
term contracts with Tesoro serve to insulate the MLP’s cash flow from the refining cycle, 
but are contingent upon TSO refineries not being shuttered for 12 consecutive months. 
 
FERC Regulatory Risk: A large portion of TLLP’s cash flow is regulated by the FERC. 
For the most part, the FERC is a benign regulator that allows an attractive return, in our 
view. However, there is always the risk that comes along with a powerful regulatory body 
being responsible for ensuring “just and reasonable” rates. 
 

Interest Rates: The entire MLP group is vulnerable to potential increases in interest rates 
in two ways. First, MLPs rely on being able to secure capital at attractive rates in order to 
grow. Since MLPs typically pay out the vast majority of their cash flow, every new large 
organic growth project or acquisition requires capital raising in the form of both debt and 
equity to maintain target leverage ratios. Therefore, if interest rates rise, an MLP’s cost of 
debt rises, decreasing cash flow. Second, as interest rates rise, competing yield-based 
investments (such as municipal bonds) may depreciate in value causing yields to rise. 
This may make alternatives to MLPs relatively more attractive and result in lower 
valuations for MLPs.

                                             Growth Drivers 
                                             Bakken Production Growth 
                                             Bakken oil production growth leads to increasing transportation volumes on the High 
                                             Plains system. We believe Bakken production will increase dramatically over the next five 
                                             years (the PIRA Energy group forecasts nearly 40% crude production from 2012 to 2014). 
                                             Enbridge Energy Partners (EEP) forecasts production for 600,000 bpd in 2014, above the 
                                             current 350,000 bpd. There are currently 180 rigs drilling in the Bakken/Williston (as of 
                                             March 2011). 
                                              
                                             Accretive Organic Growth 
                                             TLLP has announced organic growth projects on the High Plains system in conjunction 
                                             with Tesoro’s Mandan refinery expansion that we anticipate to become accretive to 
                                             earnings beginning in 2Q12 and will boost High Plains volumes by nearly 10,000bpd.  
                                             TLLP has also announced organic growth capital spending of approximately $6.8M 
                                             relating to the expansion of services and capacity in the Terminalling, Transportation and 
                                             Storage segment that we estimate will come online later in 2011. 
                                              
                                             We anticipate TLLP’s early growth projects to be highly accretive. Management forecasts 
                                             these announced growth projects to have EBITDA multiples of 1.0-2.0x, which we believe 
                                             will significantly add to DCFPU. We also believe there are numerous existing bolt-on 
                                             expansion projects available (such as increasing capacity on the High Plains system to 
                                             interconnect with other pipelines) that will be highly accretive. 
                                              
                                             Anticipated Dropdown Acquisitions from TSO  
                                             Tesoro has granted TLLP the right of first refusal for 10 assets that we believe will 
                                             eventually be sold to the partnership. We currently forecast a $100M dropdown acquisition 
                                             in both 2012 and 2013 and believe the acquisitions will provide an accretive avenue for 
                                             growth for years to come. We project that each $100M acquisition will generate 
                                             approximately 6% accretion to DCFPU assuming the deals are done at 10x EBITDA, with 
                                             potential upside if TLLP were able to increase the total percentage of capacity utilized. We 
                                             currently estimate the total amount of assets available to be $600-800M, and believe that 
                                             TLLP will utilize this strategy to achieve outsized distribution growth.

                                                 TLLP has a solid balance sheet with a low level of financial leverage, and plenty of

                                                 Should interest rates rise, TLLP’s longer-term funding may be impacted as they have not 
                                                 locked into fixed rate, long-term debt.  Management has suggested that as growth 
                                                 continues, long-term debt will be used to maintain flexibility in the credit facility. 
                                                  
                                                 Debt/EBITDA (total debt as of the IPO divided by 2011 expected EBITDA) stands at 1.3x, 
                                                 with EBITDA/interest expense (2011 expected EBITDA/2011 expected interest expense) 
                                                 at 18.5x. Both metrics are substantially stronger than most MLP peers under

                                                 TLLP has approximately $100M available under its $150M credit facility. The relatively

Long Beach Marine Terminal                       Our price target of $Long Beach, CA30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM98,800 BPD). 
                                                 The assumptions underlying this price target are stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, 
                                                 stage two (years 3- 5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 
                                                 8.0%. The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015. The price 
                                                 target implies a total return of 30% over the next 12-18 months (including the anticipated 
                                                 2011-2012 distribution yield). (Note that our return calculations exclude applicable costs, 
                                                 including commission and interest.) 
                                                  
                                                 Furthermore, we believe that the current after-tax yield (using an annualized minimum 
                                                 quarterly distribution) compares favorably to other yield-based alternatives as seen in the

                                                     We also believe that the MLP business model offers some hedge towards rising interest 
                                                     rates unlike the fixed income comparisons in Exhibit 3. While rising rates do pose a risk to 
                                                     valuation on income producing securities, we feel that these fears are overstated. We 
                                                     believe that normally, rising interest rates signal economic strength or rising inflation. In a 
                                                     strengthening economy, there is a greater demand for the energy products that MLPs 
                                                     handle. This in turn boosts throughput volumes and thus, MLP revenue. During periods of 
                                                     inflation, crude oil and natural gas prices tend to rise. We feel that this would lead to more 
                                                     drilling, production and need for the infrastructure that MLPs provide. Additionally, some 
                                                     MLP business activities contain inflation-linked escalators. In our opinion, such gains 
                                                     would help boost the distributions. See the MLP Industry report released on August 24,

                                              TLLP is 58% owned by TSO and 42% by the public. The 56% LP interest combined with 
                                              the 2% GP interest (which gives TSO the incentive distribution rights (IDRs)) helps to align 
                                              the interests of TSO and TLLP.  TSO has a strong incentive to grow TLLP’s distribution to 
                                              achieve the “high splits.” The high splits are a GP’s “happy place” where the general 
                                              partner receives 50% of all incremental distributions paid. TLLP has an advantage vs. 
                                              other MLPs without a strong, well-aligned parent company.

                                                The Crude Oil Gathering segment, which consists of the High Plains system, is located in 
                                                the Williston Basin, one of the most prolific onshore crude oil basins in the US and 
                                                includes production from the more commonly known Bakken shale formation.   

                                                The High Plains system services a significant portion of the Bakken/Williston formation 
                                                through its approximately 700 miles of pipeline and storage system and expansive truck 
                                                fleet. The pipeline has current capacity to transport 70,000 bpd, while the truck fleet can 
                                                deliver an additional 23,000 bpd. The High Plains system utilizes 24 crude oil storage and 
                                                breakout tanks with a total combined capacity of 482,000 barrels, 13 proprietary and six 
                                                third-party truck receipt locations, 44 proprietary and eight third-party pipeline gathering 
                                                receipt stations (collection points) and 11 relay stations to deliver crude oil to Tesoro's 
                                                Mandan refinery.

         Historically, the Mandan refinery was the only destination for the High Plains system. 
         However, the existing system has five pipeline interconnects.  This is where we believe 
         TLLP can unlock further value. TLLP is currently testing High Plains to increase the overall 
         capacity above 70,000 bpd, as the bulk of the system is large enough to handle more 
         capacity (the spur to Mandan is the main bottleneck at 70,000bpd). As production in the 
         Bakken continues to increase, we believe that TLLP will be able to increase overall 
         capacity on the system and serve more clients than just Tesoro’s Mandan refinery.  
         Exhibit 8 displays the current interconnect potential for the High Plains pipelines. 
          

         We believe the High Plains system is strategically placed and offers a low cost advantage 
         to peers. The location of Tesoro’s refinery creates an opportunity for Bakken producers to 
         transport oil to market more quickly than other transportation options. We believe that 
         such an advantage puts the High Plain system in position to grow volumes and creates an 
         opportunity for highly accretive bolt-on growth projects.

         Terminalling, Transportation and Storage  

         The Terminalling, Transportation and Storage segment consists of eight refined products 
         terminals located in California, Utah, Alaska, Washington and North Dakota, a crude oil 
         storage facility, three short-haul crude supply pipelines and two short-haul refined product 
         delivery pipelines. The terminals have an aggregate truck and barge delivery capacity of 
         approximately 229,000 bpd while the crude storage facilities hold a total shell capacity of 
         approximately 878,000 barrels with plans to expand storage capacity in 2011 (see the 
         growth drivers section above). 

         We believe the Terminalling, Transportation and Storage segment offers safe, fee-based 
         cash flows that are protected by long-term contracts with Tesoro. Currently, TLLP has 
         contractual minimums on 100% of the storage capacity, 82% of the short-haul pipeline 
         throughput and 87% of the terminal throughput (see contracts). We believe that as TLLP 
         opens the assets to third parties, the excess capacity may be absorbed.

  Investment Thesis

  We initiate coverage of TLLP with an Outperform rating and $30 price target. It is currently our top pick among our MLP coverage. We
  believe  TLLP  represents  the  first  opportunity  since  WES  went  public  in  May  2008  to  own  a  100%  fee-based  (low-risk)  MLP  with
  significant dropdown and organic growth potential early in its life cycle. We forecast double-digit distribution growth CAGR for the next
  several  years  as  TLLP  expands  organically  and  completes  acquisitions.  Assets  include  a  large  crude  oil  gathering  system  in  North
  Dakota  and  Montana  that  provides  exposure  to  Bakken  formation  growth.  We  believe  the  Bakken  is  in  the  very  early  stages  of
  development and that TLLP provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

  Price Target Calculation

  Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
  stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3- 5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
  The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015.

  Key Risks to Price Target
  n  Weak refined product demand
  n  Potential to overpay for acquisitions
  n  Acquisition integration
  n  Rising interest rates
  n  Economic weakness
  n  Capital markets access
  n  Major change in MLP tax code
  n  FERC regulatory risk
  n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
  n  Counterparty credit risk
  n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
  n  Extreme weather
  n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
     units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
     a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
     borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
     before making an investment in the sector.
