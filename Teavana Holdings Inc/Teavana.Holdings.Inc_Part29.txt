       Highlights From Meetings With Management                                              Stock Rating:        Outperform 
                                                                                             Company Profile:Aggressive Growth     
           We recently hosted several days of investor meetings with Teavanas management, 
           during which investors focus centered on three main concerns: 1) new store 
           productivity, 2) the lack of mean ingful transaction growth in same -store sales, and 3) 
                                                                                             Symbol:               TEA (NYSE)

           Management reiterated that the class of 2011 stores is meeting plan, and we believe Fiscal Year End:        January 
           that new store productivity is at or above the higher end of the companystarget of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate :30%
           $600,000 to $ 700,000 in annual store sales.  Moreover, we believe that the analysis Dividend/ Yield:        None    
           that several other analysts have done imputing below-plan new store productivity is 
           fundamentally flawed in several ways, including failing to account for a 15-month           2010A   2011E   2012E
           rather than 12 -month comp base and failing to adjust for $600,000 in year-ago sales Estimates*
           from the now -discontinued SpecialTeas business (a wholesale and Internet business EPS  Q1    $0.05  A$0.09  $0.13

                                                                                                 Q3      $0.01  A$0.02  $0.04

                                                                                                 Q4      $0.24  $0.31   $0.41
           75%, which would imply new store productivity of $715,000 to $720,000 modestly       FY      $0.32  $0.45   $0.62
           above managements target (versus less than $650,000 without accounting for the       CY             $0.45   $0.62
           adjustment).  In  addition, nearly 10% of the new store base was opened near the very Sales (mil.)125  168    213

           Looking forward, however, investors sh ould be cognizant that new store productivity 
           over the next several years will likely trend downward (particularly in 2013 and  Trading Data (Thomson Financial)
           beyond), as Teavana further develops locations in B malls while growing the store Shares Outstanding (mil .)   37

           Teavanas current store base, management estimates roughly 70% are in A malls,    Average Daily Volume     257,541
           versus the expectation of roughly 50% when the company reaches 500 locations 
                                                                                             Financial Data (Thomson Financial)
           (250 A and 250 B malls).  However, as the sales productivity per st  ore migrates 
                                                                                             Long-Term Debt/Total Capital (MRQ)  NA 
           closer to $600,000 in first -year sales, occupancy costs will also decline, keeping the Book Value Per Share (MRQ)NA 
           payback period for new stores at roughly 18 months.                               Enterprise Value (mil.)    573.8
                                                                                             EBITDA (TTM)                25.4
           While comps have remained healthy (up 8.5% including e  -commerce in the third    Enterprise Value/EBITDA(TTM)22.6x
           quarter), investors have w orried that the dearth of meaningful transaction growth Return on E quity (TTM)    14.2
           (up 0.5% in the third quarter excluding beverage-only transactions versus a 0.1%

           Importantly, the 8% ticket incre ase reflects both increases in average unit retail $30
           (from mix shift rather than like -for-like price increases)  and increased units (or $25
           volume) per transaction.  As a result, we believe Teavanas increase in average ticket $20
           reflects:  1) trading u p of existing customers to more -expensive teas over time, 2) an $15

         William Blair & Company, L.L.C.
                Importantly, since tea is a consumable item with a long shelf life, increased volumes of tea purchased per transaction 
                can weigh materially on overall growth in transactions.   For example, if a portion of customers extend their  purchase 
                cycle to six weeks f rom four, the number of transactions from those customers would decline more than 30%  ,while 
                the average ticket  would increase proportionally.   As a result, the lengthening purchase cycles of some customers 
                could mask increased transactions from new custome   rs on a consolidated reported basis.  
                Admittedly, without knowing the average volume of tea sold per transaction, it is difficult to ascertain just how much 
                the increase in UPT is weighing on transaction growth as a result of lengthening purchase cycles.  However, field 
                checks of stores  indicate  that new customer growth remains healthy. In addition, Teavanas oldest class of stores 
                (2004 or older) continues to comp roughly in line with the overall bricks-and-mortar average of roughly 6%, which 
                intuitively  would be very difficult to achieve without the addition of new customers to the base.
                Inventory increased 79% year  -over-year,to $32.5 million ,at the end of the third quarter, reflecting  : 1) new store 
                openings,  2) the move to direct sourcing (which occu  rred in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in more in-
                transit inventory relative to the year  -ago quarter), 3) early receipts to take advantage of product and freight 
                discounts,  and  4) a greater depth of inventory to support holiday sales (particularly big-selling items). While we 
                understand the propensity to worry over the markdown risk associated with large increases in inventory, much of 
                Teavanas inventory increase is structural  ,given the move to direct sourcing (inventory was up 82% at the end of the 
                second quarter).   In addition, none of the increase is for seasonallyspecific product and instead reflects product that 
                Teavana sells year round, thereby virtually eliminating the markdown risk.
                Other key points  include:
                    Teavana is planning  on its normal post -holiday Heavenly Sale beginning December 26, which is utilized every 
                    year to clear out discontinued merchandise and tea.
                    Management still expects a 300 -basis-point improvement in operating margin by 2015, driven equally by gross 
                    margin (as the merchandise mix increasingly shifts to tea) and leverage on SG&A.  However, with a material 
                    benefit to gross margin from direct sourcing having already occurred, gross margin gains in the next few years 
                    will likely be much more muted.
                    Beverages, which have been deemphasized since 2006, are expected to stabilize at 3% to 4% of sales ,
                    representing about 20% to 25% of transactions (down from a peak of 8% to 10% of sales and roughly 40% of 
                    transactions) .
                    Management continues to expect a  vice preside nt of marketing to be selected this quarter, with the new hire 
                    expected to develop the marketing department as well as new initiatives such as a CRM system and a loyalty 
                    program (both of which could potentially help drive traffic in the second half of 2012).  
                    While managements main objective continues to be achieving 500 stores in the U.S. by 2015, we expect 
                    international to also be further explored on both a company-operated and licensed basis (with Western Europe 
                    the most likely next market for company  -operated stores after the first Canadian store recently opened).  In 
                    addition, we suspect Teavana will likely explore its potential in CPG, however likely not until 2013 or 2014 at the 
                    earliest.
                The 10 days before Christmas are Teavanas biggest selling   days of the year, with those  10 days accounting for 10% of 
                annual sales (versus roughly 20% for the four weeks prior to Christmas and 40% for the entire fourth quarter).  
                Encouragingly, our channel checks so far in the holiday season have been robust, and we believe Teavana is well 
                positio ned to potentially beat its mid single-digit comp guidance for the quarter, which could lead to earnings upside 
                versus guidance of $0.29 to $0.31 and our and the consensus estimates of $0.31. 
                At 24 times our 2012 estimates, Teavanas stock is now trading at a discount to its 30% long-term growth rate. We 
                would be buyers of Teavana at current levels, as we believe the story is clean with a long growth path ahead,  as

                evidenced by extraordinary sales productivity of $994 per square foot in 2010 (among the highest of all mall-based 
                retailers) and consistent sales performance across all geographies. Moreover,  Teavana is one of the fastest-growing 
                retailers in the United States, and we expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% to yield 
                annual revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to five years and EPS growth of 30%-plus.  We 
                reiterate our Outperform rating.

        Stock ratings, price targets, and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. uses a three-point system to rate stocks. Individual ratings
        and price targets (where used) reflect  the expected performance of the stock relative to the broader  market  (generally the S&P 500, unless 
        otherwise indicated) over  the next  12 months. The assessment of expected performance is a function  of near-, intermediate-, and long-term 
        company  fundamentals, industry  outlook, confidence  in  earnings  estimates, valuation  (and  our  valuation  methodology), and  other  factors. 
        Outperform (O)  stock expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M)  stock expected to perform 
        approximately in line with the broader market over the next 12 months; Underperform (U)  stock expected to underperform the broader market 
        over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not currently rated. The valuation methodologies used to determine price targets (where 
        used) include (but are not limited to) price -to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with the relevant market), P/E -to-growth-rate (PEG) 
        ratio, market capitalization/revenue multi ple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.

         William Blair & Company, L.L.C.

        Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by their nature tend to be more 
        volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over a longer -term horizon, of the business risk of the company 
        relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track 
        record, market  leadership,  distinctive  capabilities);  2)  financial  profile  (earnings  growth  rate/ consistency,  cash  flow  generation, return  on 
        investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, confidence in long-term 
        growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative to the broader  William Blair universe; Core Growth (C) 
        Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk is higher relative to 
        the broader William Blair universe.

        The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion of the   individual analyst and 
        are subject to change at any time.
