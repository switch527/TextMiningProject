INVESTMENT THESIS  

TeleNav is the largest Mobile Internet company providing navigation-related services into 
the rapidly growing wireless applications marketplace. It is the largest provider of 
primarily wireless carrier “branded” turn-by-turn navigation services in the world, with 
14.5M+ paying subscribers via 15 separate wireless carrier partners in 29 different 
countries. Despite its rapid growth, TeleNav’s US penetration rate within its wireless 
subscriber base is still less than 7%, with most international markets remaining essentially 
virgin territories. As companies such as Google, Nokia, Microsoft and others begin to 
enter/offer “free” turn-by-turn services, overall consumer awareness will grow, along with 
TeleNav’s carrier partners’ interests in maintaining a strong menu of competitive offerings. 
TeleNav’s business model is closely aligned with its carrier partners’ desire to stay relevant 
in the expanding marketplace for wireless applications. Beyond continued strong 
subscriber growth within an under-penetrated marketplace, TeleNav also has strong 
offerings in both fleet telematics and in-vehicle automotive navigation.  

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU (average revenue per user)-driven 
revenue model provides excellent visibility into the company’s future financial health, 
while a solid balance sheet, highlighted by no debt and low working capital requirements, 
allows the company to generate substantial cash flow with very strong financial flexibility 
to extend its leadership opportunities via acquisitions . We are initiating coverage of 
TeleNav (TNAV : NASDAQ) with a $14 target price and BUY recommendation. Our target 
price is based on 7x our 2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M, well supported by both 
comparable and DCF analysis.  

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

Incorporated in 1999 and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, TeleNav is a location-
based services (LBS) and Mobile Internet company. Its core product is voice-guided turn-
by-turn navigation on mobile phones, but the company also develops solutions that support 
a broad range of location-enhanced applications, such as mobile advertising, commerce 
and social networking. The company’s LBS solutions, delivered through a hosted service 
business model, provide consumers and enterprises with convenient and easy-to-use 
location-specific, real-time and personalized features and functions. TeleNav provides its 
solutions through a network of wireless carriers in the US, as well as through certain 
carriers in other countries. Most carrier partners choose to preload TeleNav’s solutions on 
their new phones. Sprint and AT&T are its largest customers and represented 61% and 
29% of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2009, respectively. Although the company does offer 
its solutions under the TeleNav brand, it is more commonly delivered as a white label 
solution through its 15 wireless network carrier partners in 29 countries. Wireless carrier 
partners offer TeleNav’s services on either a standalone basis (AT&T Navigator) or bundled 
with other voice and data services (Sprint “Simply Everything” plan). As of March 31, 
2010, TeleNav had 14.5M paid subscribers across more than 500 types of mobile phones, 
all major mobile phone operating systems and a broad range of wireless network 
protocols. This subscriber base represents less than 7% of its US wireless carrier partners’ 
total subscribers today. Other major partners include Ford (SYNC platform), HP, LG, 
Motorola, NAVTEQ, Nokia, Palm, Qualcomm, RIM, Samsung and TeleAtlas. The company 
employees roughly 800 engineers (50 in China), has eight US patents and 10 foreign 

                                                                                           

                                                                                          293

COMPANY SEGMENTS 

The large majority of TeleNav’s revenue comes from its voice-guided, real-time, turn-by-
turn mobile navigation service. The service offers real-time traffic alerts, route planning 
and updated points of interest (POI) among other features. The company offers its solutions 
to a lesser extent under the TeleNav brand through its two-way, Internet connected PND 
call TeleNav Shotgun. However, its offering is more commonly delivered as a while label 
solution through its wireless network carrier partners, with the most recognizable 
applications being AT&T Navigator and Sprint Navigation. 

In addition to its core product, TeleNav offers Mobile Resource Management (MRM) 
solutions for enterprises, in-dash navigation solutions for automotive users and solutions 
that support a broad range of location-enhanced applications, such as mobile advertising, 
commerce and social networking. These offerings contribute relatively little to the top line 
today, but are expected to increasingly gain traction in coming years.

In March 2010, TeleNav released usage data that show consumers use GPS navigation 
devices for more than just directions.  The data show that users also rely on these devices 
for finding nearby businesses and searching for local hotspots. The most searched for 
businesses by TeleNav users were Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Target, Best Buy and Bank of 
America. Pizza, Chinese food, burgers, American food and Mexican food topped the list of 
food searches. Also, the data revealed that more searches occurred in Los Angeles than in 
any other city and that more residents of Phoenix searched for gas prices than in any other 
city.

CUSTOMERS AND PENETRATION RATES 

Though TeleNav currently has 15 wireless network carrier partners in 29 countries, 
revenue from Sprint and AT&T make up the large majority of the company’s revenues 
today. In fiscal 2009, Sprint and AT&T represented 61% and 29% of consolidated revenue, 
respectively. As a result, there remain plenty of opportunities to grow the business through 
not only expansion of existing carrier relationships, but also through the addition of new 
carriers.

TeleNav’s current agreement with Sprint expires on December 31, 2011, but the 
company’s right to be Sprint’s exclusive provider expires on December 31, 2010. The 
current agreement with AT&T expires on March 19, 2011, and TeleNav is the exclusive 
provider of white-label GPS navigation services to AT&T Navigator during this time. 
Neither Sprint nor AT&T is required to offer TeleNav’s LBS, but the loss of either, or a 
change in pricing strategy, could be material. 

At the current 14.5M subscriber level, TeleNav’s US penetration rate is less than 7%. 
Management expects to announce the launch of one new domestic partner in 2010 and 
sees the international market representing approximately 10% of consolidated revenue by 
2012 (currently ~3%). The biggest opportunity here is China Mobile, which has 500M+ 
subscribers. Roughly 450K subscribers are paying for mobile maps and 50K subscribers 
have adopted turn-by-turn navigation, meaning that TeleNav has the potential to add 
meaningful subscribers to its base with the signing of China Mobile (expected next year).

REVENUE MODEL 

TeleNav’s services are offered by its wireless carrier partners on either a standalone basis 
or bundled with other voice and data services. The standalone service is provided via a 
monthly recurring charge (MRC), and although it drives a higher ARPU ($9.99/month; we 
estimate TeleNav gets approximately 50% revenue share per month from the carrier), it 
carries a lower gross margin than the bundled offering and overall MRC subscriber growth 
is much lower. In the bundled offering (i.e., bundled for free with a monthly data plan 
commitment), TeleNav gets slightly less than $1 per month per subscriber from the carrier. 
This lower ARPU is offset by much faster subscriber growth. This “white-labeled” strategy 
results in deeper integration with the carrier, an expanded subscriber base and higher 
revenues. Of its two largest customers, AT&T (29% of revenues) uses the MRC model today 
while Sprint (61% of revenue) typically bundles the service. We believe expanded consumer 
awareness of “free navigation” will drive more carriers to pursue a data plan bundled 
strategy, including AT&T. Management expects MRC price reductions in 2010 (baked into 
expectations), which should impact revenue in the near term but result in both higher 
subscribers and revenue in the long term. 

Average revenue per user (ARPU). As of March 31, 20Average revenue per user (ARPU). Average revenue per user (ARPU). Average revenue per user (ARPU). 10 (FQ3/10), TeleNav had 14.5M 
paying subscribers and an ARPU of $1.02. ARPU has trended lower as a result of the shift 
in end-user growth to bundled offerings and the company’s wireless partners’ white label 
offerings, both of which constitute lower monthly fees per end user. Despite the declines, 
ARPU is projected to grow higher starting by June 2011 from a changing user mix, an 
increase in AT&T MRC pricing and growing advertising revenue.

Gross and operating margin. As of March 31, 2010 (FGross and operating margin.Gross and operating margin.Gross and operating margin.Q3/10), TeleNav had gross and 
operating margins of 84% and 42%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to decline to 
around 76% in C2011 due to declining monthly ARPU, increased subscriber usage (which 
increases COGS), lower margin on the auto business and the addition of a backup data 
center and other infrastructure investments such as staging servers and IT expansion. 
Management expects long-term gross margin of 70%. Operating margin is also expected to 
decline from current levels due to higher operating expenses and increased headcount. 
Headcount and related costs make up roughly 65-70% of operating expenses. Management 
expects long-term operating margin of 25%-30%. Though gross and operating margins are 
expected to decline over the next couple of years, the long-term projections (70%+ GM and 
25-30% operating margin) still signal a healthy and stable business.

NOTHING IS FREE 

In October 2009, the turn-by-turn navigation market was turned on its head when news 
that the Motorola Droid (launched on Verizon) would launch with free turn-by-turn 
functionality supplied by Google. Only a few months later, in mid-January 2010, Nokia 
announced free walk and drive navigation applications, using Ovi Maps, on its 
smartphones. Initially, the new version of Ovi Maps was available for download on 10 
Nokia handsets, with more expected to be added over the ensuing weeks. By March 2010, 
all new Nokia GPS-enabled smartphones included the new version of Ovi Maps. Since the 
announcement, the application has been downloaded more than 10 million times.  

While free navigation alternatives from Google and Nokia (and most recently Microsoft) are 
likely to take some market share, it is also expected to stimulate a larger carrier response 
and drive greater awareness for these applications. As consumers become more aware of 
the available offerings, we believe that they will see that TeleNav’s solutions compare 
favorably to the alternatives. Also, keep in mind that Nokia has only about 3% market 
share in the US, and while Android-based phones are today estimated at about 9% market 
share and growing, only Android 2.1-powered devices are capable of supporting its 
navigation application. Additionally, most wireless carriers continue to heavily influence 
the user experience on both feature phones and smartphones. This trend is not expected to 
change in the near term. 

Perhaps the most critical point to understand, though, is that despite Google’s and Nokia’s 
solutions being offered for “free,” consumers will still need a data plan to utilize these 
services, which could run anywhere from $25-70 per month. Both Google and Nokia will 
look to monetize their free navigation services through mobile advertising, search 
subsidization and carrier revenue sharing. TeleNav’s carrier-branded services increasingly 
come bundled with the data plans (i.e., Sprint’s “Simply Everything” plan), so it is 
essentially just as free as the Google and Nokia applications.

CATALYSTS 

Numerous opportunities exist for TeleNav to grow its business beyond our current 
projections: 

1.  New carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North AmeNew carrier partnerships, particularly in North America. T-Mobile and Verizon are the rica.rica.rica.
    outstanding US carriers with which TeleNav has only a modest relationship. T-Mobile 
    currently has about 34 million subscribers, while Verizon has about 91M subscribers. 
    Management expects that the carriers will adopt a bundling strategy, which comes at a 
    lower ARPU, but increases both the install base and revenues. TeleNav had a prior 
    agreement with Alltel to be the exclusive white label provider of navigation services, 
    but when Alltel was acquired by Verizon in early 2009 Verizon elected to discontinue 
    selling mobile phones pre-loaded with TeleNav’s LBS. Additionally, many Verizon 
    phones come pre-loaded with competitor Network-In-Motion’s (NIM) navigation 
    application. NIM was acquired by TeleCommunication Systems in December 2009. 

2.  Major ramp at China Mobile. TeleNav is the exclusivMajor ramp at China Mobile.Major ramp at China Mobile.Major ramp at China Mobile.e provider of TBT solutions to 
    China Mobile (deal announced late last year), but revenue from the deal is not yet 
    contributing to current growth. China Mobile has 500M+ subscribers, of which roughly 
    450K are paying for mobile maps and 50K have adopted turn-by-turn navigation. Any

    Should revenue from advertising occur sooner and more broadly than anticipated,

    broadening of free navigation and the potential for higher growth aided by mobile

    recurring charge (MRC) model, which drives a higher ARPU ($9.99/month; we 
    estimate TeleNav gets 50% revenue share per month from the carrier), but it carries a 
    lower gross margin and much lower subscriber growth than a bundled offering. In the 
    bundled offering, TeleNav’s solution comes free when customers sign up for a data 
    plan and the company gets about $1 per month per subscriber from the carrier. AT&T 
    is expected to remain primarily a MRC strategy, but should it switch to a bundled 
    offering, TeleNav would be expected to benefit from a rapid expansion of subscriber 
    growth rates at AT&T. As an example, we estimate TeleNav subscribers grew from 
    approximately 500K to 8.0M+ in the two years following the bundle strategy launch at 
    Sprint. 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU-driven revenue model provides excellent 
visibility into the company’s future financial health, while a solid balance sheet, highlighted 
by no debt and low working capital requirements, allows the company financial flexibility 
in what is becoming a more competitive and challenging environment. Additionally, strong 
cash flow generation and low capital expenditure requirements facilitate growth from 
within.

ESTIMATES 

We are presenting our FQ4/10, F2010 and F2011 estimates below.  

For FQ4/10, we are forecasting revenue/net income of $47M/$10M. This assumes a paying 
subscriber count of 15.9M and gross margin of 81%.  

For F2011, our estimates are for revenue/net income of $215M/$40M, which assumes 
gross margin of 78%, operating margin of 31% and paying subscribers of 18M. 

Though gross and operating margins are expected to decline over the next couple of years, 
the long-term projections (70%+ GM and 25%-30% operating margin) still signal a healthy 
and stable business.

VALUATON AND RECOMMENDATION 

We are initiating coverage of TeleNav with a $14 target price and BUY recommendation. 
Our target price is based on 7x our F2011 EV/EBITDA estimate of $77M. We believe this 
multiple could prove conservative as TeleNav’s closest competitor, Network in Motion, was 
acquired by TeleCommunication Systems in December 2009 for almost 10x EV/EBITDA.   

TeleNav’s recurring subscription-based and ARPU-driven revenue model provides excellent 
visibility into the company’s future financial health, while a solid balance sheet, highlighted 
by no debt and low working capital requirements, allows the company financial flexibility 
in what is becoming a more competitive and challenging environment. Though gross and 
operating margins are expected to decline over the next couple of years, long-term 
projections still call for 70%+ and 25-30% levels, respectively, signaling a healthy and 
stable business. We see several additional upside opportunities (i.e., China Mobile, new 
Tier 2 North America carrier, material advertising revenue contribution, etc.) that are not 
included in management’s financial projections. 

Investment risks 
Investment risks include, but are not limited to customer concentration, competition, 
scalability, intellectual property and regulation.
