Meanings of Jefferies Ratings

Hold - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of plus 15% or minus 10% within a 12-month period.
Underperform - Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total negative return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month
period.

a 12-month period as these companies are typically more volatile than the overall stock market. For Hold rated stocks with an average stock price
consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is plus or minus 20% within a 12-month period. For Underperform
rated stocks with an average stock price consistently below $10, the expected total return (price appreciation plus yield) is minus 20% within a 12-
month period.
NR - The investment rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. Such suspensions are in compliance with applicable regulations and/
or Jefferies policies.

      2. Only stocks with a Buy rating are allowed to be included in the recommended list.
      3. Stocks are screened for minimum market capitalisation and adequate daily turnover. Furthermore, a valuation, correlation and style screen
         is used to ensure a well-diversified portfolio.
      4. Stocks are sorted to a maximum of 30 stocks with the maximum country exposure at around 50%. Limits are also imposed on a sector basis.
      5. Once a month, analysts are invited to recommend their best ideas. Analysts stock selection can be based on one or more of the following:
         non-Consensus investment view, difference in earnings relative to Consensus, valuation methodology, target upside/downside % relative
         to the current stock price. These are then assessed against existing holdings to ensure consistency. Stocks that have either reached their
         target price, been downgraded over the course of the month or where a more suitable candidate has been found are removed.
      6. All stocks are inserted at the last closing price and removed at the last closing price. There are no changes to the conviction list during
         the month.
      7. Performance is calculated in US dollars on an equally weighted basis and is compared to MSCI World AC US$.
