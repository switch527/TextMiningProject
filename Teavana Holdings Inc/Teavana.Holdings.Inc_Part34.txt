                                                  Overweight rating is from investors who question whether a stock should ever deserve a

                                                  especially against a choppy macroeconomic backdrop characterized by high unemployment 
                                                  and fiscal austerity.  We’re no strangers to valuation, and these are certainly valid concerns, 
                                                  but if our 15+ years of experience covering retail growth stocks has taught us anything, it’s 
                                                  that over-reliance on traditional valuation techniques for a proven, early-stage growth 
                                                  brand is an easy way to get burned. 
                                                   
                                                  The model we set forth represents an achievable and likely beatable set of assumptions 
                                                  through January 2014, and it is important to note several things about our projections.  
                                                  First of all, our model is predicated on growth of Teavana’s core company-owned stores 
                                                  and e-commerce operations.  The possibility of growth of the company’s small franchise 
                                                  business, the potentially powerful launch of a consumer-packaged-goods or business-to-
                                                  business line, and any future international store openings are all excluded from our model.  
                                                  As detailed throughout this report, we believe that such prospects represent potentially 
                                                  significant contributions to earnings, and we think it is important to be mindful of these 
                                                  opportunities.

                                                  For valuation purposes, we believe it is most appropriate to consider Teavana when 
                                                  compared to other high growth brands, particularly those with a healthy lifestyle niche.  As 
                                                  shown in Exhibit 1, TEA shares currently trade at 41x 2012 (FY13) EPS, which represents a 
                                                  premium to its peer group average of 26x.  We believe a premium valuation is justified in 
                                                  view of Teavana’s well-above average growth prospects, and we note that valuation for 
                                                  TEA is in line with its peer group when looking at 2012 PEG.

                                   Our price target of $27 is based on 35x our FY14 EPS estimate of $0.77, a premium to other 
                                   publicly traded lifestyle brands and retailers. However, few other companies, in our 
                                   opinion, have such a well mapped-out road of double-digit earnings growth. Even fewer are 
                                   early enough along in the process that outsized earnings growth can support a premium 
                                   multiple for an extended period of time as growth rates remain high, in our view.  We 
                                   believe our assigned multiple of 35x is appropriate given our expectation for 30% to 40% 
                                   EPS growth or more for the foreseeable future. 
                                    
                                   We also note that Teavana is slated to deliver about 70% of its annual earnings in the 
                                   upcoming fourth quarter.  Should we gain visibility or increased conviction in the 
                                   company’s ability to meet or beat our expectations, we would be inclined to review our 
                                   estimates and/or our price target as the fourth quarter unfolds.   
                                    
    Teavana - It’s Not A           Teavana is a specialty retailer of tea and tea-related merchandise, founded in 1997 with the 
    Restaurant                    opening of its first store in Atlanta.  In the fourteen years since the company’s founding, 
                                   Teavana has grown to 179 stores throughout the United States, offering proprietary loose 
                                   tea blends and a mostly exclusive assortment of premium teapots and kettles.  E-commerce 
                                   sales accounted for 7% of total revenue in FY11, and we believe e-commerce penetration 
                                   could likely exceed 10% in the next three to four years.  Teavana’s stores are located 
                                   primarily in high-traffic locations in malls and lifestyle centers.  Typical locations are 
                                   located in centers with a premium anchor and upscale co-tenants such as Williams-Sonoma, 
                                   Coach, and Chico’s.  Its stores are relatively small (800 to 900 square feet), but they are 
                                   highly productive, averaging about $1,000 per square foot. 
                                    
                                   Teavana’s merchandise assortment consists of loose tea and tea blends, tea-related 
                                   merchandise, and beverages.  As shown in the following exhibit, loose tea represents the 
                                   lion’s share of total revenue, with the remainder coming primarily from tea-related 
                                   merchandise such as teapots, kettles, brewers, mugs, and other accessories.  With the 
                                   obvious exception of prepared beverages, Teavana’s sales breakdown is similar in stores as 
                                   it is online.

     Competitive                      We believe Teavana fills a highly profitable, unoccupied niche in the competitive landscape.   
     Landscape Is Highly             The market for high-end loose tea and tea-related accessories is highly fragmented, and 
     Fragmented                      there are currently no other specialty retailers of similar size focusing specifically on tea.  As 
                                         shown in the following exhibit, Teavana’s competition in the U.S. market is highly 
                                         fragmented, with no major players exhibiting a strong brick and mortar presence.  We 
                                         believe that Teavana’s scale and leverage, with landlords as well as merchandise vendors, 
                                         enables it to achieve favorable merchandise and occupancy costs relative to what new 
                                         entrants to the market would have to pay.  Thus, we believe that Teavana will likely be able 
                                         to reach its 500 store goal before any formidable competition is able to enter the fray.

     U.S. Tea Market Is               We expect Teavana to benefit from growth in overall U.S. tea consumption, as well as 
     Ripe For Further                 outperformance of high-end specialty tea brands relative to mass brands typically sold 
     “High-End-Ification”            through the food, drug, and mass channel.  A number of industry groups project U.S. tea 
                                         consumption to increase at an 8% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years, and we 
                                         believe the domestic tea market is still very much in the early stages of the “high-end-
                                         ification” that has characterized previously homogeneous categories ranging from prepared 
                                         coffee to athletic apparel to cupcakes to headphones.  Whereas these categories had few 
                                         high-end, niche, or differentiated offerings widely available to consumers as recently as five 
                                         or ten years ago, we believe it is now considered commonplace among America’s upper-
                                         middle class to pay $4 for a latte from Starbucks, a $100 for a pair of lululemon yoga pants, 
                                         $5 for a Crumbs cupcake, or $70 for a pair of Skullcandy headphones.   
                                          
                                         What do these product categories all have in common?  They all target an end-use that has 
                                         widespread demographic appeal, and high-end offerings in each of these categories can 
                                         easily be marketed to or perceived by customers as having a strong value proposition, either 
                                         because of a low average ticket and opening price point (i.e. SBUX, CRMB), or because of a 
                                         low “dollars per use” ratio (i.e. LULU, SKUL).  We believe that tea could be undergoing a 
                                         similar transformation, with high-end specialty brands likely to substantially outpace the 
                                         overall category growth rate for the foreseeable future.  In addition to widespread 
                                         demographic appeal, we believe Teavana can easily communicate its value proposition to 
                                         upper-income customers who see themselves as savvy, cost-conscious consumers.  After all, 
                                         two ounces of Teavana’s basic loose teas costs under $4, and one could reasonably expect a 
                                         $200 cast iron teapot to last for decades and sustain hundreds (or even thousands) of uses.

    Teavana Represents           In the current era of low to no square footage growth, Teavana strikes us as a rare gem of a 
    A Unique Investment          good old-fashioned store growth story.  Teavana checks all of our boxes when it comes to 
    Proposition in                 compelling growth stories: it fills an unaddressed need in the market place; its offerings 
    Today’s Market               have broad demographic and regional appeal; its merchandise is predominantly 
                                   proprietary; and it has a successful operational track record of opening new stores.  Beyond 
                                   that, we note that Teavana’s growth story is quite unique in that its merchandise mix 
                                   naturally shifts to higher-margin loose tea sales as its store base matures.  Thus, when 
                                   Teavana’s store base begins to approach saturation and square footage growth decelerates, 
                                   margin growth will likely begin to accelerate. 
                                    
                                   Growth for Teavana over the next five years will likely stem primarily from new store 
                                   openings, as the company plans to expand its store base from 179 to 500 over the next five 
                                   years.  Given Teavana’s small box size and the widespread demographic appeal of its 
                                   merchandise offerings, we view this as a realistic growth plan.  Furthermore, we note that 
                                   Teavana’s current store base is spread evenly throughout the United States, and that sales 
                                   productivity and profitability varies very little by region.  As shown in the following 
                                   exhibit, we expect Teavana to grow its store base by 34% in FY12 and 31% in FY13.

    Merchandise Mix              Excluding prepared beverages, which account for less than 5% of total net sales, Teavana’s 
    Creates Unique                merchandise assortment has historically consisted of a roughly 50/50 split between loose tea 
    Sales/Margin                  and hard goods such as teapots and kettles, however, as shown in the exhibit below, it has 
    Trajectory                     been skewing towards a higher penetration of loose tea as a percentage of total sales over 
                                    the past five years.  This trend towards a greater proportion of loose tea sales is likely to 
                                    continue for the foreseeable future and has a favorable impact to gross margin, as loose tea 
                                    carries a considerably higher merchandise margin relative to the hard goods that Teavana

                                    The primary reason that loose tea is increasing as a percentage of the total mix is a simple 
                                    one, yet it is something rarely encountered in the wonderful world of publicly traded 
                                    specialty retailers.  When a new Teavana new store opens, most of the new store’s 
                                    customers are new to the Teavana brand, and many are new to drinking tea other than 
                                    mass-brand teabags sold through the food, drug, and mass channel.  When a new loyal 
                                    customer is acquired, which naturally tends to happen more in the first year or two the 
                                    store is open, our hypothetical new customer (let’s call her Patti Pekoe) quickly realizes that 
                                    microwaving a mug of water with a teabag in it just isn’t going to cut it anymore.  So she 
                                    buys a stainless steel tea kettle.  Then summer rolls around and she realizes she needs an 
                                    iced tea pitcher.  Eventually she caves and buys that cast iron teapot she’s had her eye on.  
                                    Now that Patti has an adequate arsenal of tea makers in her kitchen, her spending at 
                                    Teavana will likely shift away from hard goods and towards loose tea and blends.

     EBIT Contribution              Ok, so now Patti Pekoe has her cast iron teapot, stainless steel tea kettle, and iced tea 
     Likely Accelerates As           pitcher.  Now what?  She may still buy the occasional tea canister for herself or gift set for a 
     New Stores Mature            friend, but at this point in her tenure as a Teavana customer, her biggest hard good 
                                      purchases are likely behind her.  The evolution of the Patti’s spending pattern has two 
                                      unusual effects on the new store’s profitability.  Firstly, it leads to strong sales in year-one 
                                      for a new store as new customers stock up on hard goods such as teapots and kettles.  This 
                                      leads to a tough comparison in year-two, as the ratio of existing customers to new 
                                      customers increase.  The basket of hard goods that Patti bought in year-one could cost 
                                      anywhere from $150 to $450, and thus it is unlikely that her predominantly-loose-tea-
                                      spending in year-two will be enough to exceed her spending in year-one.  Therefore, unlike 
                                      most other retailers, Teavana’s newest class of comparable stores typically weighs on total 
                                      company same-store sales instead of lifting the chain higher. 
                                       
                                      The second unusual effect on the P&L owing to this spending mix shift is that margins for a 
                                      new store can quickly ramp up even with little to no increase in sales.  Patti may not spend 
                                      as much at Teavana in year-two as she does in year-one, but her basket of purchases in 
                                      year-two, which included a higher proportion of loose tea, likely entailed a substantially 
                                      higher gross margin.  To demonstrate this phenomenon, we have illustrated what we 
                                      believe the EBIT contribution could look like for a hypothetical new store.  As shown in the 
                                      exhibit below, we believe that new stores are likely to see lower same-store sales for the first 
                                      year or two, with EBIT-dollar contribution accelerating in years three and four.

    E-Commerce                  Teavana’s e-commerce revenues have grown at a CAGR of 56% since FY08, and in FY11 
    Becoming a Major             the channel represented 7% of sales.  Management expects to achieve 10% e-commerce 
    Share of  “Tea”-              penetration longer term, and we believe this will likely occur in the next three to four years.  
    Commerce                    The merchandise assortment and mix between loose tea and hard goods online is 
                                   comparable to Teavana’s brick and mortar locations, and we believe that a strong majority 
                                   of Teavana’s e-commerce customers are also brick and mortar customers.  Growth of the e-
                                   commerce channel will likely stem from new customer acquisition as Teavana grows its 
                                   store base towards 500 locations from its current total of 179.   
                                    
                                   We believe that e-commerce sales could potentially represent 12% to 15% of net sales over 
                                   the next five to seven years as multi-channel customers increasingly migrate online and as 
                                   customers utilize the website more and more as an educational tool.  Teavana has highly 
                                   functional mobile and tablet applications, including for the iPhone and iPad, which offer 
                                   full purchasing functionality, suggestions of new blends to try, and even a “tea timer” that 
                                   can tell customers when to stop steeping their tea depending on the type of tea and brewing 
                                   method. 
                                    
                                   The growing penetration of Teavana’s e-commerce business should be a natural to total 
                                   company operating margin, as we believe the online channel is more profitable and requires 
                                   minimal capital investment to support.  We believe that the average order size through the 
                                   e-commerce channel is approximately 20% higher than in stores, even after excluding 
                                   prepared beverages sold through the company’s stores.  Furthermore, we believe that the 
                                   recent launch of Teavana’s auto-ship program for loose teas, which enables customers to 
                                   receive periodic deliveries on any teas at the customer’s discretion, will likely help to further 
                                   increase the merchandise mix penetration of loose tea, which could have a significant 
                                   positive impact on gross margin.

    Real Estate Strategy            New store openings will likely be the primary driver of Teavana’s earnings growth, and we 
    Is On Solid Footing           believe the company’s real estate strategy is well positioned to support this growth.  We 
                                    expect Teavana to open 50 net new stores in FY12, which represents 34% unit growth.  For 
                                    FY13 and FY14, we are estimating unit growth of 31% and 27% respectively, which would 
                                    result in 326 locations by January 2014 versus management’s goal of reaching 500 locations 
                                    in five years. 
                                     
                                    Teavana’s stores are highly productive, averaging about $1000 per square foot with an 
                                    average box size of about 900 square feet.  Due to Teavana’s high sales productivity, small 
                                    box size, strong new store growth, and the high traffic volume its stores capture, we believe 
                                    Teavana is typically viewed as a highly attractive tenant for landlords of enclosed malls and 
                                    lifestyle centers.  Given the large white space in front of Teavana in terms of store growth, 
                                    we believe it is often able to take advantage of opportunistic rents.  As a result, 100% of 
                                    Teavana’s stores generate a positive four-wall EBIT contribution, which we believe is a 
                                    testament to Teavana’s demonstrated success in site selection.  Going forward, 
                                    management has indicated that it has identified about 150 future locations down to the 
                                    individual real estate center, which should alone be sufficient to ensure two to three years of 
                                    unit growth. 
                                     
                                    As shown in the exhibit below, new stores are typically highly productive from the start, 
                                    with an average payback period of about 18 months.  Teavana’s net sales plan for new 
                                    stores is approximately $600,000 to $700,000, and we believe that the contribution margin 
                                    of its stores doing that level had a contribution margin of 25% to 30% in FY11.

    Upside To +3% SSS            Over the past five years, Teavana has achieved average annual same-store sales growth of 
    Projection Would              about 6%.  Teavana’s merchandising and in-store execution initiatives, such as customer 
    Entail Substantial              education and proprietary blends, could likely result in continued mid- to high-single-digit 
    Upside to Earnings            same-store growth in the future.  In the interest of conservatism and in order to account for 
                                    a maturing store base, we are modeling a lower 3% increase in same-store sales through the 
                                    end of FY14.  Given Teavana’s high merchandise margins (particularly on its loose tea 
                                    offerings), we estimate that should Teavana achieve same-store sales in excess of our 3% 
                                    estimate, the EBIT margin on incremental sales would be approximately 50%.   
                                     
                                    Upside to our 3% same-store sales estimate would likely come from new customer 
                                    acquisition, as Teavana continues to educate consumers on the health attributes and 
                                    enjoyable qualities of tea.  Furthermore, we believe there could be opportunities for existing 
                                    customers to spend more than expected, as more experienced customers tend to increase 
                                    their purchasing frequency over time as well as experiment with more expensive loose teas 
                                    and blends. 
                                     
                                    As shown in the exhibit below, we believe the earnings impact from better-than-expected 
                                    same-store sales could be substantial.  We estimate that an 8% increase in same-store sales 
                                    in FY13, assuming no upside to our model for the rest of FY12, would likely add between 
                                    $0.06 and $0.07 of EPS upside to our model, resulting in EPS between $0.65 and $0.66.  For 
                                    FY14, 500 bps of same-store sales outperformance relative to our +3% estimate would 
                                    likely result in $0.08 to $0.09 in upside to our estimate of $0.77.

     Un-Modeled                     Our published EPS estimates call for a CAGR of approximately 35% over the next three 
     Opportunity: CPG              years--well above the growth rates for most of its specialty retail peers.  However, we 
     Business                        believe much of TEA’s incremental value lies beyond the scope of our model, which is 
                                       based only on the company’s existing brick and mortar and e-commerce channels.  Longer-
                                       term, we believe that Teavana could launch a viable consumer packaged goods (CPG) line, 
                                       which would leverage the company’s supply-chain capabilities and likely entail minimal 
                                       incremental overhead expense.   
                                        
                                       We believe Teavana is a strong candidate for a CPG line for several reasons.  As is the case 
                                       with the brick and mortar specialty channel, the competitive landscape for high-end teas in 
                                       the domestic CPG market is highly fragmented and the larger players primarily focus on tea 
                                       bags instead of loose tea.  Teavana’s price points and brand positioning would make it a 
                                       strong partner, in our opinion, for high-end grocery or natural foods stores.  Furthermore, 
                                       with Teavana on a trajectory to exceed $100 million in revenue from loose tea sales alone 
                                       next year, we believe Teavana’s scale and sourcing efficiencies would enable it to offer 
                                       high-end grocery stores a branded wholesale CPG offering at favorable economics relative 
                                       to the grocer pursuing a private label offering. 
                                        
                                       In the exhibit below, we have illustrated what we believe the potential impact of a CPG 
                                       business could be for Teavana.  Given the high merchandise margins Teavana enjoys on its 
                                       loose teas, we believe that even after taking into account packaging and other variable 
                                       product costs, Teavana would likely achieve very high product margins on a CPG line.  We 
                                       believe that Teavana could likely add $0.09 to EPS longer term, depending on its ability to 
                                       secure distribution to a sufficient number of doors.  To be clear, these projections are not 
                                       incorporated in our earnings model and are intended only to give a sense of the potential 
                                       longer-term profitability potential of a CPG line.

     Un-Modeled                    Over the next several years, we believe it is highly likely that management will seek to open 
     Opportunity:                    international stores as Teavana approaches its target of 500 stores in the United States.  We 
     International                    expect international expansion to take a two-pronged approach, with Teavana opening 
     Expansion                       company-owned stores in markets such as Canada and Western Europe, while utilizing 
     (Company-Owned)            franchise agreements to build its presence in less developed global markets.  Given the 
                                      world-wide consumption and awareness of tea, we believe that Teavana could be a viable 
                                      retail concept on every continent on the planet, with the possible exception of Antarctica 
                                      (and even in Antarctica, wouldn’t the few researchers and die-hard        Alien vs. Predator  fans 
                                      out there want a steaming hot cup of tea?).   
                                       
                                      U.S. retailers have a long history of successfully opening stores in Canada, and a shorter 
                                      (but perhaps more profitable) history of successfully expanding to Western European 
                                      markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy.  Markets such as Canada and 
                                      Western Europe typically feature similar real estate dynamics and traffic patterns to the 
                                      United States market, and we believe expansion into these markets represents is achievable 
                                      from an operational standpoint. 
                                       
                                      In the exhibit below, we examine the potential earnings power of international expansion 
                                      using company-owned stores.  Based on our work with other American specialty retailers 
                                      opening stores internationally, our assumptions include slightly higher sales productivity 
                                      and merchandise margins for international stores, partially offset by higher occupancy and 
                                      labor costs.  We believe that company-owned stores in Canada and Western Europe could 
                                      eventually account for $0.36 or more in sustainable annual EPS.

     International                    Middle East to be pursued through franchise arrangements.  We believe the global appeal of 
     Expansion                       tea creates the potential for a large customer base in less developed markets, and Teavana’s 
     (Franchised)                    high merchandise margins and flexible real estate requirements likely make Teavana an 
                                      attractive retailer for top-tier local retail operators to partner with.  On 9/2/11, Teavana 
                                      announced that it entered into a ten-year franchise agreement for development in eight 
                                      Middle Eastern countries with the Alshaya group, a leading franchisee with experience 
                                      operating stores with brands such as Starbucks, American Eagle, and Pottery Barn. 
                                       
                                      We fully acknowledge that part of Teavana’s success in the United States has stemmed from 
                                      its ability to grow the overall category of tea by introducing high-end loose tea and hard 
                                      goods that largely represent new category offerings for domestic consumers in new markets 
                                      where Teavana opens a store.  With this in mind, clearly Teavana will face a different set of 
                                      challenges and opportunities on each continent it enters.  While Teavana may find it 
                                      difficult to replicate its U.S. mall-based market positioning in markets such as China, we 
                                      believe there could be substantial opportunity for Teavana to penetrate such markets 
                                      through the travel retail channel, with duty-free stores in particular representing a big 
                                      opportunity. 
                                       
                                      There were 19 franchised Teavana locations at the end of FQ1, up from 15 at the end of 
                                      FY11.  All but two of these stores are in Mexico, and we believe these stores are performing 
                                      well for Teavana’s franchise partner in the region.  In terms of economics, Teavana 
                                      typically collects initial franchise fees in connection with newly franchised stores as well as 
                                      continuing royalty fees, which are based on a percentage of the franchised location’s 
                                      revenue.  Franchisees purchase their stores’ loose tea and hard goods on a wholesale basis 
                                      from Teavana. 
                                       
                                      As shown in the following table, we believe modest growth of Teavana’s franchised doors 
                                      by expanding into new geographic regions could add $0.10 to annual EPS longer term.  This 
                                      growth is based on a set of assumptions which we believe are likely conservative.  
                                      Specifically, our analysis is based on an initial franchise fee of $30,000 and a continuing 
                                      royalty fee of 4.5%.  Our analysis assumes productivity of $500,000 in net sales (to the 
                                      franchisee) per franchised location, which we believe is conservative given that Teavana’s 
                                      company-owned locations averaged more than $800,000 per door in FY11 and the company 
                                      targets $600,000 to $700,000 in first year sales for new domestic locations.

    Risk Factors                  Macro.   Consumer spending is dependent on such macro-economic factors as employment, 
                                   energy prices, consumer confidence, and personal asset values. 
                                    
                                   Competition.   Retail sector is mature, thus relegating the group to margin erosion during 
                                   times of slowdown in demand. 
                                    
                                   International Risks.   Teavana has only limited experience operating outside of the U.S. 
                                   market.  Further growth will depend on the ability to effectively source its products and 
                                   secure capable franchise partners. 
                                    
                                   Limited Ability to Hedge Costs.   Unlike other food commodities such as coffee, milk, and 
                                   frozen concentrated orange juice, tea futures are not traded on any major exchange, thus 
                                   potentially pressuring Teavana’s margins if costs rise. 
                                    
                                   Availability of Real Estate.   Teavana’s growth model is predicated on a high number of new 
                                   store openings.  Should Teavana find it difficult to secure an adequate number of 
                                   appropriate locations, growth targets could be at risk. 
                                    
                                   Dependence on Key Top Management.   We believe a disruption to the ranks could have a 
                                   potential negative impact should a key executive leave the company or join a competitor. 
                                    
                                   Limited Public Company Experience.   Teavana has limited experience operating as a public 
                                   company, and thus may initially find it difficult to manage investor expectations resulting 
                                   in increased stock price volatility.

  Note: Distribution of Ratings/IB Services shows the number of companies currently in each rating category from which Piper Jaffray and its affiliates received
  compensation for investment banking services within the past 12 months. FINRA rules require disclosure of which ratings most closely correspond with
  "buy," "hold," and "sell" recommendations. Piper Jaffray ratings are not the equivalent of buy, hold or sell, but instead represent recommended relative
  weightings. Nevertheless, Overweight corresponds most closely with buy, Neutral with hold and Underweight with sell. See Stock Rating definitions below.

  Rating Definitions

     Stock Ratings: Piper Jaffray ratings are indicators of expected total return (price appreciation plus dividend) within the next 12 months. At
     times analysts may specify a different investment horizon or may include additional investment time horizons for specific stocks. Stock
     performance is measured relative to the group of stocks covered by each analyst. Lists of the stocks covered by each are available at
     www.piperjaffray.com/researchdisclosures. Stock ratings and/or stock coverage may be suspended from time to time in the event that there
     is no active analyst opinion or analyst coverage, but the opinion or coverage is expected to resume. Research reports and ratings should
     not be relied upon as individual investment advice. As always, an investor's decision to buy or sell a security must depend on individual
     circumstances, including existing holdings, time horizons and risk tolerance. Piper Jaffray sales and trading personnel may provide written
     or oral commentary, trade ideas, or other information about a particular stock to clients or internal trading desks reflecting different opinions
     than those expressed by the research analyst. In addition, Piper Jaffray technical research products are based on different methodologies
     and may contradict the opinions contained in fundamental research reports.

      Overweight (OW): Anticipated to outperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Neutral (N): Anticipated to perform in line relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.
      Underweight (UW): Anticipated to underperform relative to the median of the group of stocks covered by the analyst.

     An industry outlook represents the analyst's view of the industry represented by the stocks in the analyst's coverage group. A Favorable
     industry outlook generally means that the analyst expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to improve over the investment
     time horizon. A Neutral industry outlook generally means that the analyst does not expect the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry
     to either improve or deteriorate meaningfully from its current state. An Unfavorable industry outlook generally means that the analyst
     expects the fundamentals and/or valuations of the industry to deteriorate meaningfully over the investment time horizon.
