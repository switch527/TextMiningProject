                                                           current prices. We expect distributions to increase to an annualized rate of

                                                           provides concentration risk. Lower refined product demand could reduce Tesoro

                                                           Our forecast is dependent on TLLP coming to financial terms with its parent on

Investment Thesis 
  Long-term, fixed-fee contracts with volume commitments provide cash flow security.  Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) generates 
   a substantial portion of its revenue under long-term, fee-based contracts with Tesoro Corp (“Tesoro” or “parent”).  These contracts 
   include minimum volume commitments and fees that are indexed for inflation, which both support stability of cash flows and limit 
   commodity exposure.  Under the agreements, TLLP provides pipeline transportation, trucking, terminal distribution, and storage 
   services to Tesoro, and Tesoro provides TLLP with minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil and refined products.  The 
   contracts include 10-year pipeline transportation in the Bakken on the High Plains system, a two-year trucking agreement in the 
   Bakken, and 10-year storage and terminalling agreements in TLLP’s Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage segment.  We also 
   expect TLLP to explore other opportunities to provide fee-based services through organic growth projects. 

  Solid near-term organic growth opportunities should be nicely accretive given conservative capital structure out of the box.  
   Tesoro Corp. has historically allocated minimal growth capex to its logistics assets because returns were not sufficient for the 
   refining company (typically 16–20% IRRs), and the assets were viewed as a cost center.  However, these returns are attractive for 
   an MLP structure, and we believe TLLP can spend relatively small levels of capex to optimize the asset base, fill existing capacity, 
   and add new capacity. TLLP exited its IPO with only $50 million in debt (revolver draw) and a leverage ratio of less than 1.0x 
   Debt / 2011 EBITDA. The partnership has additional borrowing capacity on its revolver of $100 million and can expand the 
   revolver by an additional $150 million through the accordion feature.  Given this borrowing capacity, we expect TLLP to easily 
   fund the next $100 million of organic growth capex and drop down payments through debt financing, which should make for more 
   accretive projects.  TLLP has earmarked $15.5 million of near-term organic growth capex over the next two years, which is 
   expected to generate run-rate EBITDA of about $10.5 million.  These projects will focus on filling High Plains system capacity in 
   the Bakken and capturing additional services in the Terminalling segment.  This implies very accretive projects at less than a 2.0x 
   EBITDA multiple and the ability to grow EBITDA by over 20% even assuming no drop downs occur.   

  Significant drop-down potential offers visible ongoing growth.  The initial assets dropped to TLLP in the IPO generate roughly 
   $50 million–$55 million of annual EBITDA.  Tesoro has also identified a portfolio of assets that it has agreed to give the right of 
   first offer (ROFO) to TLLP.  The ROFO assets include three product terminals, two pipelines, and four marine terminals.  Tesoro 
   Corp. has a work team in place focused on prioritizing the potential drop downs.  Some of the projects require more commercial 
   development than others, but we expect a deliberate and ratable asset drop schedule over the next several years (for comparison 
   purposes, the IPO process took six months and involved 10 assets, so we feel this ratable schedule is erring on the side of 
   conservatism).  In total, we estimate that the ROFO assets can generate annual EBITDA of $50 million–$80 million, which 
   provides nice visibility on growth. We model a $50 million asset drop every 6 months beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 using 
   an 8–9x EBITDA multiple (so roughly $5-6 million in annual EBITDA per drop). 

  Asset footprint in regions of high demand and production growth.  TLLP’s High Plains system is a premier crude gathering 
   system in the Williston Basin (Bakken Shale), which is one of the most prolific and active onshore oil producing basins in North 
   America.  RBC estimates North Dakota rig count to increase from 177 rigs currently to about 200 by year end 2011.  While 
   estimates for future Bakken production vary widely, we see some level of consensus for Bakken production to double within the 
   next five years (from about 400 Mbopd currently), and this could prove conservative if the current drilling pace holds.  Tesoro 
   recently announced that it is expanding its capacity at the Mandan refinery (the only refinery within 300 miles of the Bakken) from 
   58,000 Bopd to 68,000 Bopd, which will provide a near-term growth opportunity for TLLP (High Plains’ sole function right now is 
   to feed the Mandan refinery).  In addition, as production in the play grows, there is an increasing need for crude oil takeaway 
   capacity.  We believe that TLLP is well positioned to benefit from this trend, as High Plains is ideally situated to add interconnects 
   to third-party pipelines to increase utilization on the system (TLLP can push 70,000 Bopd to Mandan now, but the system can 
   handle over 100,000 Bopd if interconnects are negotiated). On the terminalling side, TLLP’s assets are primarily located on the 
   West Coast, which is an area of expected growth in refined product demand. 

  TLLP is low in the GP splits, which should benefit the limited partners. TLLP is currently in the 2% general partner splits, 
   which should provide the opportunity for acquisitions to be more accretive to unitholders.  The lower split level lowers the cost of 
   capital versus MLPs higher in the split. 

                                                                                                                                   2

       TLLP Investment Risks 

       We consider two sets of risks when looking at a master limited partnership. First are the risks that come from holding the asset class 
       (think of the different risk profile between sub-sectors, like a regulated pipeline asset versus gathering and processing asset). Second 
       are the risks associated with holding assets in a master limited partnership structure.  

       TLLP-Specific Risks 
         TLLP derives substantially all of its revenue from sponsor Tesoro Corp. and would be adversely affected if it does not satisfy its 
          commercial obligations to TLLP.      

         Lower refined product demand could reduce Tesoro refining margins and volumes of crude and refined products handled by TLLP.  

         The partnership’s assets are concentrated and reduced production in the Bakken Shale could reduce volumes gathered by the High 
          Plains system. 

         Our forecast is dependent on TLLP coming to financial terms with its parent on the drop down assets.  If TLLP does not come to 
          financial terms, or if these terms are not as favorable as our forecast, this could have an impact on our analysis.     

       Overall MLP Risks 
         Credit markets: Valuations are impacted by changes in overall interest rates and credit spreads. Rising interest rates or widening 
          spreads in the credit market tend to negatively impact the valuation of MLPs. 

         Trading liquidity: MLPs tend not to be traded as often as their corporate counterparts mainly due to accumulating tax deferrals. 
          Therefore, trading liquidity is limited in many of the public partnerships. 

         Potential conflicts with general partner: Most MLPs have a GP that is incentivized to grow the distribution pool (either by 
          increasing the distribution and/or issuing more LP equity). This conflict could allow the GP to reap higher economics on 
          transactions while the limited partners achieve minimal accretion or, worse, dilution. In addition, this potential conflict entices the 
          GP to add riskier assets to grow the distribution pool. Investors should pay particular attention to the incentive distribution rights 
          (IDRs) held by the GP; as the “splits” work higher, they could potentially increase the cost of equity capital for the partnership.   

       Valuation 

       Using our multi-stage dividend discount model (DDM) for the LP units, we calculate a 12-month price target of $28/unit, which 
       implies a yield of 5.7% on our one-year-out distribution estimate of $1.57/unit. Our DDM is based on our distribution estimates for the 
       four quarters starting one year out and then a five-year growth rate of 9% (from the current distribution rate, these assumptions result 
       in an annualized growth rate of 13% over the next five years).  We discount our DDM distributions at a rate consistent with our 
       interest rate expectations and the risk associated with an Average risk qualifier.  Our risk qualifier considers and weighs various risk 
       factors, including TLLP's trading liquidity, debt to forward EBITDA of 0.9x, forward total unit coverage of 1.1x, diversification, and 
       commodity exposure. 

       Comparable Company Valuation 
       We believe TLLP deserves a yield premium given the potential for above-average distribution growth over the next several years as 
       the drop down story unfolds.  Based on our analysis of comparable company valuations, TLLP is currently trading at an approximately 
       10% premium to the group on a yield basis. Note that our 2011 and 2012 EBITDA growth estimates assume additional debt balances 
       to complete asset acquisitions while the valuation multiples below use the existing net debt balance of approximately $47 million.

      Distribution Structure and Outlook 
      TLLP Poised to Deliver Outsized Distribution Growth:  TLLP has a minimum quarterly distribution (MQD) of $0.3375 per 
      common unit or $1.35 annualized, representing a 5.5% yield at the current price. We forecast total distributions of $0.9329 in 2011 
      and $1.6230 in 2012, representing 74% growth as the IPO year only includes a partial distribution. However, we expect TLLP to 
      deliver outsized distribution growth with an annualized distribution rate of $1.7730 in the fourth quarter of 2012, which represents 
      25% growth over the $1.4130 rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.    

      Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs):  IDRs, which are owned entirely by the general partner Tesoro Logistics GP, will not be 
      triggered until common and subordinated unit holders receive an aggregate distribution of $0.388125.  

      Subordinated Units:  Tesoro Corp. owns all of the 15.3 million subordinated units, or 49% of the total outstanding limited partner 
      interest. The subordinated units can receive the MQD only after the common units have received the MQD and any arrearages from 
      prior quarters. The subordination period ends after TLLP has paid the MQD for three consecutive years on or after June 30, 2014 or 
      150% of the MQD ($2.025) for the four quarters prior to that date.

Partnership Overview 
                                                                                 1
TLLP is a growth-oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corporation                         (TSO:    $ 24.14  : Sector Perform, Above Average Risk)              to operate its 

gathering and processing       , and short   - haul pipelines, trucking and terminalling logistics asset            s.  The partnership intends to operate its 

assets under long    -term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and pursue asset drop                        -down growth opportunities. The initial assets 

are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale, West Coast, Ro                       ckies and Alaska with potential drop          -downs near 

existing infrastructure.        

TLLP   was formed via an initial public offering on             April   19 , 2011  , when   Tesoro Corp     .,  as the sole selling shareholder      , sold   13 ,000,000 

common units at a price of $        21 .00  per unit   for  net proceeds of $246.6       million  .  TLLP   receive   d $3  million   for working capital w       ith the 

balance used to fund $2 million          of debt issuance costs and a $241.6           million   distribution to Tesoro. Additionally, the partnersh            ip 

concurrently entered a $150 million           cre dit facility and drew $50       million   to fund an additional distribution to Tesoro.             Following the 

offering and full exercise of the        1 ,9 5 0,000 over  -allotment option,      Tesoro Corp.     owns   0.3  million    common units,      all  15.3  million   

subordinated units     ,  and  0 .6 milli  on  GP units ( which   in total  represents a    5 2 .0% interest   ) .  Common unit holders own a          48 .0%  common 

interest.  

TLLP Incentive Distribution Rights Structure  

Tesoro Corp. owns a 2.0% interest in all distributions in addition to holding 100% of the incentive distribution rights above minimum 

and target distribution levels.  The incentive distribution rights entitle the general partner to receive increasing percentages, up to 48%, 

of distributions from operating surplus after pre-defined distribution targets.

Initial Assets Overview 
As part of the IPO, Tesoro Corp. contributed crude oil and refined products logistics assets with gross book value of $193 million to 
the partnership, supported by fixed-fee minimum volume agreements with Tesoro. The initial assets consist of a crude oil gathering 
system in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota and Montana, eight refined products terminals in the Midwest and Western US, and a 
crude and refined products storage facility and five short-haul pipelines in Utah. The partnership’s assets and operations are organized 
in two segments: Crude Oil Gathering and Terminalling, Transportation and Storage. Exhibit 4 summarizes the partnership’s initial

     Crude Oil Gathering Segment 
     The partnership’s common carrier High Plains system in North Dakota and Montana consists of 23,000 bpd truck-based crude 
     gathering capacity and 700 miles of pipeline and storage assets with capacity to deliver up to 70,000 bpd to Tesoro’s 58,000 bpd 
     Mandan, ND refinery (the only refinery within 300 miles of the Bakken). We believe the High Plains assets present significant organic 
     expansion opportunities, including capturing third party volumes and replacing truck-gathered volumes with higher margin pipe 
     connections. The partnership expects minimum contracted volumes under agreements with Tesoro to account for approximately 88% 
     and 97% of 2011 pipeline and trucking volumes, respectively Exhibit 5 provides a summary of the High Plains assets.

     Crude Oil Gathering Organic Growth Opportunities 
     Mandan Refinery Expansion: Tesoro parent recently announced plans to increase capacity at its Mandan refinery from 58,000 Bopd 
     to 68,000 Bopd, with expected in-service in the second quarter of 2012.  TLLP has identified $6.6 million of capital opportunities over 
     the next 12 months to support the Mandan expansion.  We expect this capex to drive an additional $6.4 million of EBITDA on an 
     annual basis after completion in the second quarter of 2012, which implies an approximately $4.3 million contribution to full year 
     2012 EBITDA.

24.0 Other Organic Growth Opportunities: Beyond what has been identified to support the Mandan refinery expansion, we believe 
     TLLP may also pursue opportunities to capture growing Bakken take-away demand in addition to its Mandan volumes.   
                                                            23.4
23.5
       Notably, referring back to 23.3
                                   Exhibit 5, TLLP has the potential to interconnect with pipelines at Portal, Fritz, and Fryburg in North 
        Dakota and with the Bridger Pipelin23.0
         23.0                               e in Richey, MT.  While TLLP can currently push 70,000 Bopd to the Mandan refinery (stated 
23.0
        capacity on the system), the physical capacity is over 100,000 Bopd if these interconnects can be negotiated.  Two or three o22.7f the 
        interconnects are very low capex requirements (basically turning a valve) and two or three of the interconnects are a bit more 
22.5
        capital intensive.  Regardless, we believe this is a nice source of potential growth. 

       We believe TLLP may look at opportunities to move crude oil away from the Bakken (including to the West Coast), and this could 
22.0
        include capital spent around Mandan to give the MLP that capability. 

21.5   Within the trucking segment, TLLP also may be able to better optimize its fleet over time, as the partnership currently utilizes 55% 
        third-party trucks.  This is primarily due to the difficulty to obtain and retain drivers, but if TLLP is able to increase its proprietary 
21.0    mix, we believe this could have some positive impact on results. 
         2009         2010         2011        2012         2013
       We also believe that the partnership will seek to engage producers to replace truck-gathered volumes with pipeline volumes, which 
        offers a higher margin.   

                                                                                                                                          8

Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage Segment  

The partnership’s Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage assets are located primarily on the West Coast and are comprised of eight 
refined products terminals and a refined products and crude storage facility with related short-haul pipelines serving Tesoro’s Salt 
Lake City refinery. The product terminals have 229,000 bpd aggregate truck and barge delivery capacity and primarily support 
Tesoro’s Los Angeles, Golden Eagle, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. The partnership expects minimum 
contracted volumes under agreements with Tesoro to account for approximately 86% and approximately 90% of total 2011 terminal 
and pipeline throughput, respectively. Exhibit 9 provides a summary overview of the refined product terminals.

     Terminalling, Transportation & Storage Organic Growth Opportunities 

     TLLP has identified $8.9 million of capital opportunities over the next nine months within the segment, which we expect to drive an 
     additional $4.5 million of annualized EBITDA when complete by the first quarter of 2012.  Spending on the projects, which are 
     outlined in Exhibit 12, will mostly occur in 2011 and we estimate an approximately $3.4 million impact to full year 2012 EBITDA.  In 
300.0
     general, we believe TLLP’s greatest opportunities within the terminalling segment will be tapping third-party volumes.  Third-party 
     volumes were not actively pursued under Tesoro’s control 244.7(so as to keep optionality open), but we believe the MLP will be better 
250.0
     positioned to optimize the existing asset base. In addition to the identified opportunities, we believe TLLP can pursue further 
     expansions and optimization opportunities, representing upside to our estimates.

The Drop-Down Opportunity 
TLLP has articulated a three-pronged strategy for distribution growth, which includes optimizing the existing asset base and capturing 
additional third-party volume, pursuing organic growth projects, and acquiring complementary logistics assets.  On the acquisition 
front, Tesoro has granted the partnership a right of first offer to acquire certain of its logistics assets, providing a pipeline of low-
hanging growth opportunities over the next several years.    

Right of First Offer (ROFO) Assets 
TLLP has right of first offer to acquire certain Tesoro logistics assets including terminals, pipelines, docks and storage facilities 
located in Alaska, California and Washington. Management has identified an inventory of assets with gross book value of $240 
million. Tesoro parent has a work team in place focused on prioritizing the potential drop downs.  Some of the projects require more 
commercial development than others, but we expect a deliberate and ratable asset drop schedule over the next several years (for 
comparison purposes, the IPO process took six months and involved 10 assets, so we feel this ratable schedule is erring on the side of 
conservatism).  In total, we estimate that the ROFO assets can generate annual EBITDA of $50 million–$80 million.   

We summarize the primary ROFO assets identified by the partnership in Exhibit 13.

Our cash flow and distribution growth projections assume TLLP consummates $50 million of asset drops every other quarter 
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 with an average transaction multiple of 8-9x EBITDA, which implies annual EBITDA 
contributions of $5.5 million–$6.25 million per transaction. During our forecast period ended December 2013, we assume five 
transactions totalling $250 million at a 9.0x EBITDA multiple resulting in an ~$27.8 million cumulative EBITDA contribution (see 
Exhibit 14 below). Our asset drop assumptions drive our outsized annualized distribution growth estimates of +25% and +23% for the 
fourth quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2013 respectively.  Our full year distribution growth estimates for 2012 and 2013 of 74% 
and 25% are skewed by the fact that 2011 is a partial distribution year.

        We believe TLLP’s solid financial position will allow it to deliver highly accretive growth through acquisitions in the near-term 

        without the need for additional equity raises in the foreseeable future. After the IPO, TLLP has only $50 million of debt outstanding 

        under its $150 million revolver which equates to ~0.9x Debt / forward EBITDA and ~12x of forward interest coverage.  In addition to 

        $100 million of current availability, the credit facility can ultimately be increased to $300 million with additional lender commitments.

        Balance Sheet 

        TLLP has $50 million of outstanding long-term debt, which was a $50 million draw on its revolver.  The partnership has an additional 

        $100 million of revolver availability, which we expect to be utilized over the next year to fund organic growth and drop down 

        acquisitions.  We expect debt/EBITDA to increase from ~0.9x currently to around 3.0x by year end 2012 and 3.5x by year end 2013, 

        which is at the high end of management’s comfort zone.  If the partnership undertakes larger or more numerous transactions than those 

        assumed in our model, an equity issuance would likely be necessary.  

        Debt covenants are fairly relaxed, as the credit facility allows debt/EBITDA to increase to 4.5x for an acquisition, thereby allowing it 
($ in MM, except per share data & ratios)
        to serve as a sort of bridge facility.  Longer2011 Quarterly Results

    The Bakken Shale Advantage 

    Well Positioned for Bakken Shale / Williston Basin Production Growth:  The Bakken Shale is a leading unconventional oil 
    producing zone within the Williston Basin, which extends across North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and parts of southern Canada. 
    After a 2008 study, the US Geological Survey classified the Bakken as the largest “continuous” oil accumulation assessed by it to 
    date, with 3.0 – 4.3 BBbls of technically recoverable reserves. TLLP’s High Plains assets are uniquely levered to Bakken production 
    growth which should remain robust as favorable economics drive increasing rig counts.

Valuation
Using our multi-stage dividend discount model (DDM) for the LP units, we calculate a 12-month price target of $28/unit, which
implies a yield of 5.7% on our one-year-out distribution estimate of $1.57/unit. Our DDM is based on our distribution estimates for the
four quarters starting one year out and then a five-year growth rate of 9% (from the current distribution rate, these assumptions result
in an annualized growth rate of 13% over the next five years). We discount our DDM distributions at a rate consistent with our interest
rate expectations and the risk associated with an Average risk qualifier. Our risk qualifier considers and weighs various risk factors,
including TLLP's trading liquidity, debt to forward EBITDA of 0.9x, forward total unit coverage of 1.1x, diversification, and
commodity exposure.

Price Target Impediment
Among the key issues that could impede our price target are:
 Acquisition risk;
 Damage to pipeline infrastructure;
 Commodity price risks;
 TLL is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro
  would negatively impact results.
 Trading liquidity in the units is relatively low; and
 Other risks, including prolonged declines in volumes, interest rates, and regulatory risk.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies and Alaska with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors, including total
revenues  of  the  member  companies  of  RBC  Capital  Markets  and  its  affiliates,  a  portion  of  which  are  or  have  been  generated  by

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy
RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,
Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7. We reserve the right to amend or supplement this policy at any time.

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls
RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.
