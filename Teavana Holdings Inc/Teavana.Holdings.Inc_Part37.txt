                          Teavanas stock valuation of 41 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reflects a premium to 
                          its peer group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers such 
                          as Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-
                          income consumers, such as Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon 
                          athletica. However, Teavanas long-term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-
                          growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As a 
                          result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.4 times exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 
                          times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient premium retailers such as Whole 
                          Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios of 1.3 to 1.7 times).  
                          While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas 
                          premium valuation is justified, based on its strong growth prospects and historically resilient 
                          sales trends, and we expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth 
                          with the potential for upside.    

                  Summary and Investment Thesis  
                  Founded in 1997 by current Chairman and CEO Andrew Mack and his wife, Nancy, Teavana is a 
                  rapidly growing specialty tea retailer, with about 180 domestic mall-based stores across 36 states 
                  (including 2 franchised locations) and 17 franchised stores in Mexico. Featuring a large selection of 
                  loose-leaf premium teas as well as tea-related merchandise, Teavana offers a differentiated and 
                  compelling mall-based experience with its inviting store format and highly trained staff.  
                  Teavanas store base has more than tripled in the past four years, and sales have grown at a 
                  compound annual rate of 38% over the same time frame, inclusive of growth of 38% in 2010 to nearly 
                  $125 million. Loose-leaf tea accounts for 56% of sales; tea-related merchandise, 40%; and prepared 
                  beverages, 4%. Teavanas average ticket is $36 in its stores ($46 excluding beverages) and $55 
                  online, with the company generating about 7% of sales through its e-commerce channel.  
                  Compelling Premium Tea Retailer With Impressive Sales Productivity 
                  Teavanas consumer appeal is illustrated by the companys strong sales productivity of $944 per 
                  square foot in 2010, with consistent performance across geographies. Moreover, Teavana has 
                  experienced positive same-store sales in each of the past five years, with only one quarter of negative 
                  comps (-1.6% in fourth quarter 2008), pointing to the resiliency of consumer demand for Teavanas 
                  products. Given the long shelf life of its products and low markdown levels, Teavanas gross margin 
                  was a healthy 62.9% in 2010, and Teavanas operating margin increased from 7.5% in 2008 to 18.8% 
                  in 2010.

                  Teavanas stores feature a Wall of Tea (roughly 100 tins of premium loose-leaf tea), a wide array of 
                  tea-related accessories and items, and highly trained store associates who educate consumers about 
                  Teavanas products and the tea-making process. With premium loose-leaf teas ranging from $3 to $40 
                  for two ounces (the minimum amount sold), Teavana offers an affordable yet premium healthy lifestyle 
                  indulgence, with two ounces yielding an average of 20 to 25 cups of tea translating to less than 
                  $1.80 per cup at the highest price point.  

                  The U.S. tea market has experienced robust growth, reaching $5.2 billion in sales in 2009, according 
                  to market research firm Mintel, with a compound annual growth rate of roughly 11% from 2004 through 
                  2009. We believe the U.S. market for tea still has plenty of room to grow, as the United States 
                  represented only about 9% of total worldwide tea sales of $56.6 billion in 2009, with per capita tea 
                  consumption well behind many other nations. Encouragingly, Mintel expects the tea market in the 
                  United States to continue to post steady growth, projecting an approximate 6% compound annual 
                  growth rate through 2014.

                   Excellent Store Productivity Yields Consistently Robust Store-Level Returns 
                   Teavana averaged sales per store of $844,000 in 2010 (up nearly 6% year-over-year), with all classes 
                   of stores (by age) experiencing gains. Moreover, Teavanas merchandise mix becomes increasingly 
                   more profitable as stores mature, as the mix naturally shifts toward high-margin loose-leaf tea as a 
                   store ages (also indicative of strong customer loyalty).

                   Encouragingly, Teavanas performance has been remarkably similar across all regions of the country, 
                   including the West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast, with each region consisting of roughly 25% of 
                   locations and contributing roughly 25% of sales. Teavanas average four-wall cash contribution margin 
                   was 30% in 2010, with all stores profitable.  

                   New-store sales productivity is targeted at $600,000 to $700,000 per year (although the company has 
                   easily exceeded that target each of the past two years) on a net cash investment of $200,000 to 
                   $250,000 per store, as a greater proportion of non-A malls are expected to account for future growth. 
                   New stores are anticipated to generate 25% cash contribution margins and cash-on-cash returns of 
                   about 75%, with a payback period of roughly 18 months.

          William Blair & Company, L.L.C. 

                  Ample Opportunity for Store Expansion 
                  From about 180 company-owned stores today, we believe that Teavana has the opportunity to nearly 
                  triple its U.S. store base, in keeping with managements goal of reaching 500 domestic stores by 2015. 
                  Should Teavana meet its objectives, it would be one of the fastest-growing publicly traded retailers, 
                  with 50 new company-owned stores expected in 2011 (up 34%) and 60 new stores in 2012 (up 31%).  

                  While Teavanas growth plans are aggressive, we believe they may also be necessary to cement the 
                  concepts first-mover advantage, particularly as others are likely to notice Teavanas highly profitable 
                  model now that the company is publicly traded. We believe there are 500 high-quality domestic malls 
                  that meet Teavanas requirements, and we see the potential for the company to augment its mall-
                  based locations with strategically placed street locations in the future. Teavana also has 17 franchised 
                  stores in Mexico, and we expect the company to explore additional international expansion 
                  opportunities in coming years through company-owned development and/or franchised agreements.  
                  To this point, Teavana recently announced a 10-year development agreement in the Middle East with 
                  Alshaya, a leading franchise operator of other concepts such as Starbucks, P.F. Changs, and The 
                  Cheesecake Factory.  

                  Over the longer term, we believe the Holy Grail would be for Teavana to evolve from a retailer into a 
                  market-defining brand, similar to what Starbucks has achieved over the past 20 years. While such 
                  stories are rare, we see parallels in Teavana bringing its European-style specialty tea retail experience 
                  to the United States to the way Starbucks introduced Americans to Italian-based espresso beverages. 
                  If Teavana can define the tea market in the way that Starbucks has dominated specialty coffee, we 
                  see the potential for meaningful brand extension opportunities in the premium grocery and foodservice 
                  channels (Starbuckss consumer packaged goods business accounted for 17% of its operating profits 
                  in fiscal 2010).  

                  We Expect 30% Annual EPS Growth Over the Next Three to Five Years 
                  We expect 25%-plus unit expansion and same-store sales gains of 3% to 4% per year will yield annual 
                  revenue growth in the high-20% range over the next three to five years. We expect a modest 
                  contraction in operating margin in 2011 given incremental infrastructure expenses associated with the 
                  companys new store support center, expansion of the companys distribution center, and the buildout 
                  of systems and marketing functions. In addition, we see the potential for a mix shift toward lower-
                  margin merchandise over the holidays this year, a category that management believes 
                  underperformed in 2010 (merchandise seasonally peaks as a percent of sales during the holidays).  

                  Despite the potential for infrastructure investments to constrain margins over the near term, we expect 
                  consistent operating margin improvement beginning in calendar 2012 and more so in calendar 2013 
                  given a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin loose-leaf tea as stores mature, the benefits of 
                  increased scale with suppliers, and leverage on fixed costs. Over the longer term, we believe 
                  operating margins in the low-20% range are achievable, versus 18.8% in 2010.  

                  Primarily reflecting strong sales growth, we project EPS of $0.44 this year (up 39%), $0.59 in 2012 (up 
                  34%), and $0.77 in 2013 (up 30%).  

                  Premium Stock Valuation Appears Fair Given Growth Prospects 
                  Teavanas stock valuation of 41 times our calendar 2012 EPS estimate reflects a premium to its peer 
                  group average of roughly 22 times, which includes specialty beverage retailers such as Starbucks, 
                  Caribou Coffee, and Peets, as well as other retailers that cater to higher-income consumers, such as 
                  Williams-Sonoma, Coach, Whole Foods Market, and lululemon athletica. However, Teavanas long-
                  term EPS growth rate of 30% eclipses even its fastest-growing peer (lululemon at 25%) and easily 
                  surpasses the peer group average of 18%.  As a result, although Teavanas PEG ratio of 1.4 times 
                  exceeds its peer group average of 1.2 times, its premium is in keeping with high-quality, resilient 
                  premium retailers such as Whole Foods, lululemon, Peets, and The Fresh Market (all with PEG ratios 
                  of 1.3 to 1.7 times).  

                  While we would not call for multiple expansion from current levels, we believe that Teavanas premium 
                  valuation is justified given its strong growth prospects and historically resilient sales trends, and we 
                  expect investors to be rewarded with healthy 30% annual EPS growth with the potential for upside. We 
                  are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and Aggressive Growth company profile.

                       Investment Risks  

                       Rate of Store Growth Could Strain Operations 

                       Teavanas plan to expand its domestic company-owned store base from about 180 stores today to 500 

                       stores over the next five years is ambitious and could strain the companys human resources while 

                       potentially damaging its distinctive culture based on extensive training and superior customer service. 

                       In the near term, Teavana plans to open 50 stores in 2011 (up 34%) and 60 stores in 2012 (up 31%), 

                       and we project 70 new stores in 2013 (up 27%). While we believe that Teavana is well positioned to 

                       execute on its plans for new stores, we view the companys ability to successfully open high-volume 

                       new stores as critical to the stocks performance.  

                       New Stores May Not Be as Productive as Existing Store Base 

                       Teavana has achieved sales productivity that is among the highest in mall-based retail. However, as 

                       the company grows, its proportion of A malls will decrease as Teavana enters a wider array of less 

                       productive malls, which could result in average unit volumes declining from current levels. 

                       Management is already handicapping for this potential outcome, modeling new store volumes at 

                       $600,000 to $700,000. Importantly, even at lower volumes, unit-level returns remain healthy, as stores 

                       within this sales bandwidth achieved cash contribution margins of 25% to 30% in 2010.  

                       Reliance on Single Product Category 

                       Teavanas business is concentrated on a single product premium loose-leaf tea and its related 

                       merchandise. Teavanas sales would likely be penalized by any negative news related to the quality or 

                       safety of tea or tea-related products.  

                       Exposure to Mall-Based Traffic Trends and Seasonality of Earnings 

                       Teavanas mall-based real estate strategy renders it susceptible to mall traffic trends. In addition, 

                       Teavana earns the bulk of its earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter of the year, which typically has 

                       roughly twice the revenue of any other quarter and contributes the vast majority of full-year earnings 

                       (75% in 2010). As a result, the company is particularly vulnerable to events that hinder consumer 

                       spending or mall traffic during the holidays. The first quarter is the second-most-profitable quarter for 

                       Teavana, with the second and third quarters only slightly profitable.  

                       Limited Float Post-Deal 

                       Teavana has a limited float following the companys IPO, as founder and CEO Andrew Mack still holds 

                       57% of shares and private-equity investor Parallel Investment Partners holds 19%.

                     Sharon Zackfia attests that 1) all of the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect his/her personal views 
                     about any and all of the securities and companies covered by this report, and 2) no part of his/her compensation was, 
                     is, or will be related, directly or indirectly, to the specific recommendations or views expressed by him/her in this report. 
                     We seek to update our research as appropriate, but various regulations may prohibit us from doing so. Other than 
                     certain periodical industry reports, the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals as deemed appropriate by 
                     the analyst.  

                     Stock ratings, price targets, and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. uses a three-point system to 
                     rate stocks. Individual ratings and price targets (where used) reflect the expected performance of the stock relative to 
                     the broader market (generally the S&P 500, unless otherwise indicated) over the next 12 months. The assessment of 
                     expected performance is a function of near-, intermediate-, and long-term company fundamentals, industry outlook, 
                     confidence in earnings estimates, valuation (and our valuation methodology), and other factors. Outperform (O)  stock 
                     expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M)  stock expected to perform 
                     approximately  in  line  with  the  broader  market  over  the  next  12  months;  Underperform  (U)    stock  expected  to 
                     underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR)  the stock is not currently rated. The 
                     valuation  methodologies  used  to  determine  price  targets  (where  used)  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  price-to-
                     earnings multiple  (P/E), relative  P/E  (compared  with  the  relevant  market),  P/E-to-growth-rate  (PEG)  ratio, market 
                     capitalization/revenue multiple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.  

                     Company Profile: The William Blair research philosophy is focused on quality growth companies. Growth companies by 
                     their nature tend to be more volatile than the overall stock market. Company profile is a fundamental assessment, over 
                     a longer-term horizon, of the business risk of the company relative to the broader William Blair universe. Factors 
                     assessed include: 1) durability and strength of franchise (management strength and track record, market leadership, 
                     distinctive  capabilities);  2)  financial  profile  (earnings  growth  rate/consistency,  cash  flow  generation,  return  on 
                     investment, balance sheet, accounting); 3) other factors such as sector or industry conditions, economic environment, 
                     confidence in long-term growth prospects, etc. Established Growth (E)  Fundamental risk is lower relative to the 
                     broader William Blair universe; Core Growth (C)  Fundamental risk is approximately in line with the broader William 
                     Blair universe; Aggressive Growth (A)  Fundamental risk is higher relative to the broader William Blair universe.  

                     The ratings, price targets (where used), valuation methodologies, and company profile assessments reflect the opinion 
                     of the individual analyst and are subject to change at any time.  

                     The compensation of the research analyst is based on a variety of factors, including performance of his or her stock 
                     recommendations;  contributions  to  all  of  the  firms  departments,  including  asset  management,  corporate  finance, 
                     institutional sales, and retail brokerage; firm profitability; and competitive factors.
