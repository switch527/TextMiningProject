    Tangoe as the clear leader in the underpenetrated  market of Communications                           OUTPERFORM

    margin    expansion,    we    see    mea ningful    EPS    growth.    We    believe    the      
    company’s recurring services  model provides good revenue visibility. Last,                           12-Month Price Target 
    given its core Telecom Expense Management (TEM) solution provides  solid 
    ROI, we see Tangoe as somewhat recession-resistant.                                                   $27             
                                                                                                           
 •  Market leader in the fast-growing and underpenetrated TEM market.  Being >3x                           
    bigger then the closest competitors, there is a general feeling among IT managers                     Scott Sutherland, CFA

 •  Sticky  recurring  model  provides  solid  revenue  visibility.  89%  of  Tangoe’s                     
    revenue in 2011 was related to recurring services and that  is expected to increase                    
    to 90-92%. Furthermore, we believe the solution is somewhat sticky after an initial     Company Information  
    investment in bill auditing and on-boarding of billing records. Last, with the average 
    recurring revenue of ~$150K for >800 customers, revenue is diversified.                  Shares Outst (M)                                         41.7

 •  Expect acquisitive strategy to aid growth and market dominance, but could 
    also pose integration risks.  Tangoe has acquired eight companies in the past                         52-Wk Range                     $8.01 - $23.05

    However,  we  believe  this  has  resulted  in  a  non-integrated  offering,  which  has              Cash/sh                                    $1.73  
    caused some customer concern despite the high ROI of TEM solutions.                   Enterprise Value (M)                                     $803.5

    somewhat rich. However, the model is in early stages of scale, and revenue growth                      
    remains  strong.  We  believe  solid  EPS  growth  should  justify  valuation,  but  is     Company Description

the symbol TNGO on the NASDAQ.  As of May 2012, Tangoe has 1,100 employees and 14 offices. 
We  like  Tangoe’s  leadership  in  the  large,  growing,  and  underpenetrated  markets  of  CLM,  TEM,  and   MDM  (mobile  device 
management). As the market leader with global scale, the argument that “you can’t get fired going with Tangoe” rings true. This should 
lead to additional share gains in these fast growing markets. We also believe the cost-savings of the TEM market could prove to be 
somewhat recession-resistant. As we believe complexity of telecom services and billing is increasing, we believe TEM solutions such 
as Tangoe’s should benefit as enterprises will find managing telecom costs and devices in-house more difficult. We see Tangoe gaining 
scale through solid organic and inorganic growth, which should lead to a doubling in EBITDA margins in the coming years.  
However,  we  are  concerned  about  the  early  stages  and  fragmented  markets  for  CLM  and  TEM,  which  has  led  to  a  plethora  of 
competitors  from  smaller  direct  vendors  to  systems  integrators  and  carriers.  In  addition,  we  wonder  if  customers  will  reduce 
dependence as their telecom expense management reaches more optimal levels via Tangoe’s solutions. We believe Tangoe also 
needs to justify its valuation through solid revenue growth and margin expansion. While the company does trade at a discount to some 
enterprise SaaS vendors, we do see Tangoe as a hybrid model with some custom and non-scalable services. Last, we see some risks 
regarding integration and distraction, given Tangoe’s aggressive acquisition strategy. Our checks indicate this has led to a somewhat 
fragmented offering from Tangoe. 
Overall, we are generally positive on Tangoe, as we see solid growth and margin expansion continuing and see the company as 
somewhat resistant to a slowdown in the global economy. While valuation appears somewhat rich, we expect solid EPS growth to be 
driven by 20%+ organic growth of recurring revenue (~90% of total revenue), M&A, and margin expansion. With 20% top-line growth 
and a doubling of EBITDA margins expected in the coming years, Tangoe looks much more reasonable on a P/E basis in the out years. 
We initiate coverage with an OUTPERFORM rating and $27 PT, which represents a 42x multiple on our 2013 cash-adjusted EPS 
estimate. This is in line with our long-term EPS growth rate of 37%, which we believe may prove conservative given the company’s 
leadership position in the fast-growing TEM market.

Key Investment Points  

Addressing a Large Untapped Market Opportunity in Telecom Expense Management 
According to Tangoe, enterprises spent $425 billion globally on fixed and mobile telecom in 2011. Tangoe currently manages $17.6 
billion or ~4.1% of the total spend globally, and Tangoe is by far the largest provider in the fragmented TEM market. We expect Tangoe 
to continue to penetrate this market through a combination of increasing customer penetration, new customers, regional expansion 
(namely Europe), and additional market share acquisitions. According to Gartner, the TEM market is expected to grow at a 22% CAGR 
from $894 million in 2010 to $1,951 million in 2014 (see Figure 1).

Increasing Complexity of Telecom in the Enterprise Should Favor TEM 
Historically, enterprises spent mostly on fixed voice services. However, over time, Internet, hosting, connectivity, wireless and other 
telecom services have penetrated the enterprise. This has increased complexity, the number of bills and vendors, and the number of 
connected devices in the enterprise. We believe this increases the challenges for enterprises to manage their telecom expenses in an 
efficient manner. Of note, through its ~750 customers at the end of 2011, Tangoe supports service coverage in over 180 countries and 
territories in over 125 currencies with support for approximately 1,700 different communications providers and 1,900 different billing 
formats. In addition, connected devices continue to proliferate in the enterprise. We expect smartphones to grow at a 30% CAGR from 
490 million in 2011 to 825 million in 2013. Gartner expects tablets to grow at a robust 44% CAGR from 60 million in 2011 to 369 million 
in 2016. We also see other connected devices penetrating the enterprise, further increasing complexity. Management has indicated that 
there is typically a 3% changeover in devices per month in the enterprise, which we expect to increase and further increase complexity. 
ROI Case for TEM Should Help Tangoe Navigate Potential Recessions 
Tangoe  provides  several  areas  to  support  the  ROI  to  its  clients  from  reduced  expenses  to  improved  productivity.  We  believe 
corporations  are  always  looking  to  reduce  expenses  in  a  non-disruptive  manner,  even  in  rough  economic  times.  Based  upon 
Wedbush’s proprietary Decision Metrics Survey, 29% of respondents indicated that service-provider savings was the top focus for 
savings. This compares to 59% indicating capital expense and 15% indicating labor. Service provider focused savings has ranged from 
19-36% over the past four years of our quarterly survey. We see several key areas of ROI from Tangoe’s solution including (1) reduced 
expenses  such  as  billing  errors,  overages,  unused  plans,  plan  optimization,  and  pooling;  (2)  increase  productivity  through  timely 
provision  of  devices,  applications,  and  access;  (3)  optimized  service  agreements  focused  on  capabilities  and  rate  structures;  (4) 
improved control and visibility through organization of bills and tools to analyze; and (5) better risk and policy management such as 
controlling unauthorized use, safety of sensitive data, and remote swiping of information.

Tangoe is the Market Leader with Scale and a Solid Track Record 
Tangoe currently has more than 1,100 employees supporting over 800 customers in over 180 countries and territories. Based upon our 
checks,  this  scale  has  proven  attractive  to  customers,  especially  multinationals  needing  global  support.  With  most  competitors 
generating <$20 million in recurring revenue in 2011, we believe this scale has proven to be a competitive advantage for Tangoe. 
Overall, Tangoe is at least 3x the size of its closest competitor, IBM. We point out that IBM is currently a key Tangoe channel partner, 
and recently acquired competitor Rivermine. That said, Tangoe’s management has indicated it is seeing Rivermine less in the market. 
However, we plan to closely watch this relationship. Checks also highlight Tangoe has a good track record keeping customers, which 
has led to a retention rate >90% according to the company. However, we caution that the TEM market remains in early stages.  

M&A Strategy Brings Additional Scale, Products, and Regions 
Since  2007,  Tangoe  has  made  eight  strategic  acquisitions.  Management’s  goal  is  to  gain  scale,  add  new  products,  and  expand 
regionally. In terms of scale, we believe it is a competitive advantage in the TEM market. Several acquisitions including TRAQ Wireless, 
ISG, HCL-EMS, Telwares, ProfitLine, and ttMobiles have improved scale and international presence. TRAQ Wireless and InterNoded 
brought MDM capabilities, while Anomalous Networks brought rTEM (real-time TEM), which enhances both Tangoe’s TEM and MDM 
products. In Figure 8, we go into further detail regarding Tangoe’s acquisitions. Thus far, we have been impressed with Tangoe’s M&A 
strategy as it has remained focused on its three-pronged strategy and the company has shown prudence in terms of price. 

Recurring Revenue Model Provides Solid Visibility 
Tangoe primarily provides its solutions on a SaaS-like basis after shifting from a perpetual license model in 2006. In 2011, 89% of 
revenue was tied to recurring technology and services and this is expected to trend to 90-92% in the coming years with the remainder 
coming from strategic consulting, software licenses and other revenue. We estimate Tangoe is currently generating ~$150K in annual 
recurring revenue per customer per year for its >800 customers with no customer >10% and IBM the only 10%+ reseller. With contracts 
ranging 2-5 years and renewal rates >90%, Tangoe has solid revenue visibility. 

Inherent Leverage Should Lead to Solid Margin Expansion with Solid Recurring Revenue Growth 
With data centers and a platform in place that recognize over 125 currencies and 1,900 billing formats with connections to more than 
1,700  communications  service  providers,  Tangoe  should  see  increasing  economies  of  scale  as  it  brings  on  additional  clients. 
Management’s target goal is to double EBITDA margins from 12.1% in 2011 to 24-26%. Management expects this to occur through 
improved gross margin (scale and revenue mix) and leverage in R&D and G&A, while investing in S&M. However, we point out that we 
expect Tangoe to have some ongoing margin pressure given it will be unlikely to fully automate its customer solutions, which should 
always require some custom/manual work. This is typically tied to billing formats that cannot be digitized and upfront services to get 
clients up and running.

Risks 

CLM and TEM is a Fragmented and Early Stage Market 
We see solid growth opportunities, but the CLM and TEM markets are still emerging and highly fragmented. While there is lots of 
headroom for TEM, the market could develop more slowly than expected, which could temper the high growth rates Tangoe has 
enjoyed.  We  also  believe  this  has  led  to  various  types  of  competitors,  from  smaller  direct  competitors,  divisions  of  much  larger 
companies, and even service providers themselves. We believe this could create confusion and various types of pricing in the market 
and even aggressive pricing in order to gain share during the developing years of the TEM market. 
Potential Diminishing Customer Returns 
We believe the ROI presented by Tangoe’s solution is very significant. However, we believe as initial efficiencies are addressed that 
additional ROI may be harder to come by. If customers realize or even perceive ROI is decreasing, they could reduce spending on 
Tangoe’s solutions or even feel they could take some work back in house. That said, given devices in the enterprise turn over ~3% 
monthly; ongoing M&A in enterprises, carriers, and billing systems; continued employee turnover; new types of telecom services and 
billing plans; and the increasing trend of BYOD (bring your own device), we believe there will always be meaningful inefficiencies to 
address in CLM. 
Ongoing M&A Strategy Could Pose Integration Risks and Distractions 
Tangoe has acquired eight companies in the past five years (see Figure 8). While most of these acquisitions have been moderate in 
size, we believe the number of acquisitions could prove a challenge to integrate simultaneously and a distraction to the business. 
Based on our checks, we believe technology platforms of previous acquisitions have not been fully integrated, leading to a fragmented 
offering. Going forward, we expect the company to continue to be acquisitive. In addition, Tangoe is still on the hook for $17 million in 
contingent consideration and deferred acquisition payments related to several of these acquisitions, which would create a drag on cash 
generation.  Last,  the  returns  on  acquisitions  may  not  meet  expectations.  Of  note,  while  we  believe  Tangoe  has  been  a  prudent 
purchaser, revenue from the HCL, Telwares, and ProfitLine acquisitions are down YoY, which we believe is due to some customer loss.  
Standardization or Increased Simplicity of Billing Provided by Operators 
The  driving  force behind  TEM  is  a complex  market of billing  and  operations support  systems,  and an increasingly diverse  set  of 
connected devices. As noted previously, Tangoe interfaces with >1,900 billing formats. Should consolidation in the BSS (Business 
Support Systems) and OSS (Operations Support Systems) markets continue and lead to more standardized billing formats, the need 
for third-party TEM solutions could be reduced. Likewise, an increased dominance of a device and/or O/S could also simplify billing. For 
example, Apple and Google have created their own payment systems and wallets, which could relegate carriers to billing for data usage 
(gigabytes) only. As Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems continue to gain share, this risk could increase. 
Increasing Dependence on Channel Partners 
Tangoe currently generates ~25% of its bookings through ~27 alliance partners of which ~two-thirds is through IBM, HP, Dell, and 
Xerox (ACS). Other key alliance partners include Bell Canada, Singtel, ISI, SPN, mobility, Insight, Advocate, webb, Pivotel, GQ AAS, 
Intersel, and others. We believe the increasing reliance on partners could reduce visibility into the pipeline and increase dependence on 
select partners. In addition, certain key channel partners such as IBM, which generated ~10% of Tangoe’s revenue in 2011, could 
appear  to  be  becoming  more  competitive  with  IBM’s  acquisition  of  Emptoris,  whose  Rivermine  subsidiary  has  historically  been 
competitive with Tangoe. Last, IBM and Dell have both been awarded performance warrants and IBM has the right of first refusal to bid 
for Tangoe.  
Varying Flavors of Competition 
We believe CLM, TEM, and MDM are all emerging markets with various types of competitors, from smaller direct competitors, divisions 
of much larger companies, and even service providers themselves. We highlight the TEM competitive landscape in tiers in Figure 10. 
We believe some smaller competitors could prove irrational with pricing in order to gain share, which could prove disruptive. Smaller 
competitors could also be more regionally focused, thus making it harder for Tangoe to penetrate certain markets. We believe larger 
competitors such as systems integrators (SIs), could offer scale, size, global presence, and a bundle of services to compete more 
effectively with Tangoe. Even partners such as IBM with its acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine, could become more competitive, though 
we do not see this as likely near term. In addition, carriers such as AT&T and Vodafone offer TEM services. Of note, we would highlight 
Vodafone’s  acquisition  of  two  TEM  companies,  Quickcomm  and  TnT  Expense  Management.  However,  we  believe  carrier-based 
solutions may prove challenging as most enterprises purchase telecom services through multiple operators in multiple countries. In 
MDM, Tangoe is more of an emerging competitor that is going up against several larger and more established competitors. Tangoe’s 
angle is the integration of its TEM and rTEM capabilities.

Company Overview 
Tangoe  provides  Communications  Lifecycle  Management  (CLM)  solutions  globally  to  a  range  of  enterprises,  helping  manage  the 
growing fixed and mobile telecommunications expense for its customers. CLM is a combined offering of telecommunications expense 
management (TEM) and mobile device management (MDM) services. The CLM market is accelerating as telecom expenses rise. 
Gartner estimates that TEM revenue will grow at a CAGR of 22% from $894M in 2010 to $1.951B in 2014. This market should grow at 
the expense of in-house TEM solutions, which we believe have proven inefficient. As of May 2012, Tangoe is the market leader in TEM, 
controlling $17.6B, or 4.1%, of the $425B in annual global enterprise telecommunications spend. 
 
Tangoe  operationalizes  its  CLM  via  its  On-Site  Communication  Management  Platform  (CMP)  software.  The  software  provides  a 
comprehensive solution for Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) and Mobile Device Management (MDM) and facilitates 
asset management, expense management, and usage management for communications assets and services. In addition to the CMP 
software,  Tangoe  provides  strategic  consulting  services  including  sourcing,  strategic  advisory  services,  bill  auditing,  inventory 
optimization, mobile optimization, and policy administration. The company has a diverse mix of clients and offers a value proposition 
that includes delivering a substantial ROI, and increasing internal efficiency through centralization of enterprise communications efforts.  
 
Tangoe commenced operations in February 2000 in Orange, CT as a provider of fixed TEM solutions. The company has since grown 
through organic growth and M&A expansion (acquired eight different companies in the past five years) and is viewed as the premier 
provider of a comprehensive fixed and mobile TEM solutions and an emerging player in MDM solutions. Following its IPO on 7/27/2011,

Products and Services 

CLM grows in conjunction with an ever-expanding communications environment. Adoption of connected devices and technologies such 
as smartphones, Voice over IP (VOIP), and tablets has resulted in a growing global telecommunications expense for enterprises and 
increased complexity.  In-house solutions are often inefficient and result in reduced productivity, security risk, inaccurate financial 
reporting, and dramatically increased expenses (a phenomenon referred to as “bill shock”). Figure 3 below illustrates a high-level view 
of the areas within the enterprise that Tangoe’s technology interacts with and provides. From a high level, Tangoe will review take in 
digital versions on telecom bills and details. Once on-boarded, Tangoe will monitor and analyze the flow of telecom expenses and help 
enterprises manage the costs in an efficient manner. Tangoe has also moved into MDM, which can help manage “bill shock” given the 
explosion  in  mobile  data  usage.  For  example,  Tangoe’s MDM  solution can  help alert  IT  managers  when employees are  roaming 
internationally without an international roaming plans.

On Site Communications Management Platform  
Tangoe enables CLM through its On-Site Communication Management Platform (CMP), which consolidates fixed and mobile TEM to a 
single location. Tangoe’s CMP provides TEM and real-time TEM (rTEM) solutions by providing on-site communication via third-party 
enterprise systems and Tangoe’s client groups, and providing accurate, real-time data and logs of communications. This software has 
three segmented packages, which provide a holistic CLM service: asset management, expense management, and usage management. 
Tangoe’s CMP represents most of the company’s visible recurring revenue. Tangoe engages in long-term subscription-based contracts 
with it customers ranging from 24-60 months.  
 
Strategic Consulting and Other Services   
Aside from CMP, Tangoe provides strategic consulting services, which consists primarily of services related to contract negotiations 
and bill audits. Contract negotiation fees include both fixed project fees and incentive fees driven by the amount of savings that the 
company  is  able  to  generate  over  the  customer’s  existing  communications  rates.  These  fees  are  recognized  when  fixed  and 
determinable, usually when the customer and carrier execute the contract. Bill audit fees are driven by the amount of savings that the 
company is able to generate by reviewing current and prior communications invoices against the customer’s existing contracts. These 
fees are recognized when fixed and determinable, usually when the carrier agrees to issue a credit or refund to our customer. Other 
strategic  consulting  services  include  sourcing,  strategic  advisory  services,  inventory  optimization,  mobile  optimization,  and  policy 
administration.

Revenue Model 

Tangoe generates revenue from two main operations:   its recurring technology and services revenue and its strategic consulting, 
software licenses and other revenue.  Prior to 2006, the company derived its revenue on a transactional, non-recurring basis.  The 
recurring technology and services revenue primarily consists of operations from Tangoe’s CMP platform, and is generated through a 
24-60 month subscription service, which includes a base charge and then additional charges based on customer threshold levels of 
telecom spend. The revenue is recognized at a given rate during the course of the subscription.  Strategic consulting services revenue 
consists mostly of bill auditing and contract negotiation fees.  Both bill auditing fees and contract negotiation fees rise relatively to the 
amount of savings provided, incentivizing customers through a value proposition.  

For TEM, management takes on customers with annual telecom spend as low as $5 million to well over $500 million. With $17.6 billion 
of annual spend under management and an estimated 890 customers, we calculate an average spend per customer of ~$20 million. 
We currently estimate management garners 0.7% of this spend per customer on recurring subscription-basis with a goal to increase 
this to 1.1-1.2% due to increased customer penetration and new modules. For MDM, Tangoe gets paid per device under management 
in a very wide range of $1-15 annually. Management indicated that it currently has 2.5 million devices under management.

Strategy 

Tangoe maintains a tripartite growth strategy: (A) increased scalability, (B) technological growth, and (C) international expansion.  The 
specific mechanisms to enable this strategy are as follows: 
•   Increase customer base (A/C)  - Tangoe aims to continue adopting new customers. This has been accomplished through a hybrid 
    of  organic  growth  and  inorganic  growth  via  augmentation  of  competitors  and  expansion  into  MDM  services.  The  last  five 
    acquisitions (HCL-EMS, Telwares, ProfitLine, Anomalous, and ttMobiles) has brought in >255 customers to Tangoe’s customer 
    base of well more than 800 enterprises. Looking forward, Tangoe anticipates continuing this trend through the addition of sales and 
    marketing personnel, so it can effectively market to new enterprises.   
•   Continue trend of successful acquisitions (A/B/C)  - Tangoe has synergized its organic growth with its acquisitions, increasing 
    its scalability, technological capabilities, and international presence, while eliminating competitors in a highly fragmented market.  
    Through its pipeline of acquisitions, Tangoe is developing a more comprehensive CLM solution, providing a portfolio of TEM, 
    rTEM, and MDM solutions to enterprises globally.  Looking forward, Tangoe will continue practicing this three-fold acquisition 
    philosophy—gaining scalability, increasing technological capabilities, and penetrating international markets.  
•   Further penetrate international markets (C)  – Development of Asian, European, and Latin American markets provide a rich, 
    potential growth driver for TEM and MDM solutions.  On an annual basis, Tangoe manages $4.6b in international communications 
    expense, which equals 27.4% of its total managed communications expense.   The uncertainty global enterprises face regarding 
    TEM and MDM, combined with the inefficiency of first-party solutions logically points to the proven value proposition offered by 
    Tangoe.  With the acquisition of ttMobiles, Tangoe has established a presence in the UK.  Tangoe offers a globally capable 
    software solution, offering support for 1,700 different communications carriers (80% of global communications carriers) and 1,900 
    different formats in 16 different languages processed by 97 global invoice processing centers.  To continue expansion, Tangoe 
    plans  to  continue  growing  new  customers  and  operations  in  global  markets  both  by  hiring  additional  sales  and  operations 
    personnel, and by further localizing their CMP software. 
•   Use  and  continue  building  successful  strategic  alliances  (A)   -  Tangoe  has  existing  strategic  alliances  with  major  global 
    enterprises such as Dell, IBM, and Xerox, and additional mobile service relationships with Bell Canada, SingTel, Starhub, and 
    Telefonica.    Currently,  25%  of  Tangoe’s  bookings  are  coming  from  partners.  Looking  forward,  Tangoe  seeks  to  make  more 
    alliances and leverage these alliance relationships in conjunction with sales efforts to increase its customer base and operations.  
•   Continue providing and further extend CLM solution (B/C)  - Tangoe is the leader in providing CLM solutions, and seeks to 
    continue expansion of its consolidated fixed and mobile CLM solution through further technological and service development, and 
    localization into new domestic and international locations.   
•   Renew  and  expand  existing  customer  relationships  (A)  –  Management  currently  believes  it  has  penetrated  the  existing 
    customer opportunity by ~30% and sees opportunity to expand globally with multinationals and by selling additional modules and 
    applications that drive additional ROI.  As new technologies and connected devices such as VoIP, smartphones, and tablets 
    become  more  readily  adopted  by  enterprises,  Tangoe  will  grow  its  CLM  solution  to  accommodate  increased  expenses  of 
    communications assets and services.  This expansion will be seen in TEM, but more so in MDM.

Mergers and Acquisitions  

Tangoe’s  M&A  strategy  is  driven  by  three  primary  characteristics:    increase  of  scale,  technological  capabilities  and  international 
presence.  Its M&A strategy catalyzed Tangoe’s penetration of MDM solutions, and its expansion into the global market.  Its history of 
M&A is as follows: 
 
TRAQ Wireless —On March 9, 2007, Tangoe merged with TRAQ Wireless, a provider of wireless TEM solutions.  With the merger of 
TRAQ Wireless, Tangoe not only increased its business scale, but also penetrated the wireless TEM space and expanded its platform 
to include MDM functionalities.  This merger aligned Tangoe with the flourishing enterprise MDM demand, and allowed it to provide a 
consolidated package of both fixed and wireless TEM. 
 
Information Strategies Group (ISG) —On July 5, 2008, Tangoe acquired ISG, a provider of telecommunications expense processing 
services and technology.  With the acquisition of ISG, Tangoe improved the functionality of its expense management service, and 
enhanced its technological profile with ISG’s call accounting product and billing chargeback and allocation software.  
 
InterNoded Inc. —On December 23, 2008, Tangoe acquired InterNoded, a global provider of MDM solutions.  With the acquisition of 
InterNoded, Tangoe expanded its business scale by gaining new customers, and strengthened its global MDM solution.  
 
HCL-EMS —On January 5, 2011, Tangoe acquired HCL Expense Management Services (HCL-EMS), a provider of fixed and mobile 
TEM solutions.  With the acquisition of HCL-EMS, Tangoe grew its scalability, gaining multiple processing centers, operation personnel, 
new customers, and new operations.  Moreover, Tangoe stretched its global reach by augmenting a competitor in global TEM space. 
 
Telwares —On March 16, 2011, Tangoe acquired Telwares’ division of TEM, and announced a strategic global alliance with Telwares.  
Tangoe continued to increase the scale of its business, acquiring Telwares’ invoice management, call accounting, and MDM solutions. 
 
ProfitLine —On December 19, 2011, Tangoe acquired ProfitLine, a global provider of TEM and MDM services.  With this acquisition, 
Tangoe digested a global provider of TEM and MDM solutions, increasing Tangoe’s scale by integrating new personnel, customers, 
and operations. 
 
Anomalous Networks —On January 10, 2012, Tangoe acquired Anomalous Networks, a provider of real-time TEM (rTEM) solutions 
for  communications  devices  such  as  smartphones,  tablets,  PCs,  and  modem-enabled.    Adding  rTEM  to  its  technological  profile 
furthered Tangoe’s CLM capabilities in both fixed TEM and MDM, as rTEM functionality allows Tangoe to provide services such as 
“predictive cost intelligence, ‘bill shock’ prevention, user alert acknowledgement tracking, usage anomaly detection, and enhanced 
policy enforcement.”  This process results in better TEM data accuracy. 
 
ttMobiles —On February 21, 2012, Tangoe acquired ttMobiles, a MDM services and solutions provider to UK enterprises.  Tangoe 
again extended its global reach, and focused specifically on the European market.  Tangoe also integrated ttMobiles sundry functions 
including  mobile  sourcing,  provider  migration,  localized  charge  auditing,  personal  call  management,  cost  control,  recorded  call 
management, fleet administration, and complete outsourced mobile management.

Customers 

 

Tangoe claims a customer base of over 800 that stretch across a range of enterprise verticals. Based upon our analysis, we believe 
Tangoe is nearing 900 total customers. Tangoe acquires customers through a combination of internal wins and M&A. Of note, in 2011, 
we  estimate  Tangoe  added  255  customers  with  105  added  organically  and  150  through  the  acquisitions  of  HCL,  Telwares,  and 
ProfitLine. In Q1, we estimate Tango added 135 customers with 35 added organically and 100 added through the acquisitions of 
Analogous Networks and ttMobiles. Our checks with certain customers indicate a solid ROI for Tangoe’s solution and comfort given the 
company’s  size,  global  coverage,  and  investment  in  new  technology  (e.g.,  MDM).  However,  some  customers  expressed  concern 
regarding the lack of a fully integrated offering due to the numerous acquisitions though we believe these comments are tilted towards 
customers acquired mostly via acquisitions. Overall, Tangoe claims a >90% renewal rate.

Competitive Landscape 
Tangoe leads a highly fragmented TEM market with a diverse customer base and broadest offering of mobile and fixed CLM.  However, 
Tangoe faces competition in different forms, which we have segmented into three separate tiers.  The tiers are defined as follows: 
      •       Tier 1—These companies are Tangoe’s premier competitors.  These enterprises command a significant stake in the global 
            TEM market, and directly compete with Tangoe’s core revenue and can steal potential growth. 
      •       Tier 2—These companies operate on a much smaller scale than those in Tier 1.  Their main threat is that they operate in the 
            North American region, which threatens Tangoe’s core revenue. 
      •       Tier 3—Similar to Tier 2, these companies operate on a smaller scale than Tier 1.  However, their primary operations are in 
            Latin America or Europe, which is distanced from Tangoe’s core revenue, but they threaten Tangoe’s potential growth.

In the MDM market, Gartner considers Tangoe a niche challenger. While there are several strong players in enterprise MDM such as 
Mobileiron, AirWatch, Fiberlink, Zenprise, Good Technology, we believe Tangoe’s strategy in MDM is to enhance its TEM offering and 
to provide a more comprehensive CLM solution.

Q2, 2012 and LT Guidance and Outlook 

For Q2, Tangoe expects revenue of $35.0-35.5 million, up 34-36% YoY. EBITDA is expected to be $4.3-4.5 million with an EBITDA 
margin of 12.5% at the midpoint. Pro forma EPS is expected to be $0.09, up from $0.06 in Q2 2011 and flat with $0.09 in Q1. Total 
shares are expected to be 41.7 million, which includes the majority of the effect of the 2.2 million share follow on offering on April 3, 
2012, which generated $37 million of net proceeds to the company. The offering was part of a larger 8.0 million share offering, which 
included 5.8 million shares from selling stockholders. 
For 2012, Tangoe slightly increased revenue and EBITDA guidance, while lowering EPS guidance by $0.01 due to a $0.02 dilutive 
impact from its follow on offering. Management now expects revenue of $142.3-144.3 million, up 36-38% YoY. EBITDA is expected to 
be $20.2-20.7 million with an EBITDA margin of 14.3% at the midpoint. Pro forma EPS is expected to be $0.41-0.42 based on 41.3 
million shares (was 39.5 million previously). 
Long-term, management expects recurring revenue to increase to 90-92% of total revenue from 89% in 2011. Gross margin is expected 
to increase to 61-63% from 53% in 2011. EBITDA margin is expected to increase to 24-26% from 12% in 2011. The 1200-1400 basis 
point improvement in EBITDA margin is expected to be driven by the 800-1000 increase in gross margin, lower R&D and G&A spend 
on a percentage basis, and higher S&M spend on a percentage basis. 
Our estimates are in line with guidance and consensus estimate for 2012 but slightly above for 2013. Longer-term, we expect Tangoe 
to hit the lower end of its target model by 2016.

Valuation and Recommendation 

Comparative Analysis  
For comparison, we measured Tangoe against a group of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies (Figure 13). We compared 
the companies on the basis of enterprise value to sales, enterprise value to EBITDA, price-to-free cash flow, P/E and P/E to growth. 
Among Telecom Software peers, Tangoe currently trades at a discount to its mid- and large-capitalization peer group on a 2013 PEG 
basis. It trades deservedly at a premium on other metrics due to its superior growth and more predictable SaaS model. Tangoe trades 
at a discount to SaaS peers on all metrics except being inline on EV/sales.

Discounted Cash Flow 
We performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis in which we measure the sensitivity of Tangoe’s 12-month price target to different 
assumptions regarding the discount rate and terminal growth rate to our estimated 2017 year cash flow. We used 12.5% as a discount 
rate and 7% as a terminal cash flow growth rate. As a result, we arrive at an average 12-month valuation of $27. We also provide a 
range of values by varying the discount rate from 11.5% to 13.5%, and the terminal growth rate from 5% to 9%.

Valuation Summary 
We rely on our DCF analysis to arrive at a price target of $27. This represents a 42x multiple on our 2013 cash-adjusted EPS estimate. 
This is in line with our long-term EPS growth rate of 37%, which we believe may prove conservative given the company’s leadership 
position in the fast growing TEM market and likely upside to EPS estimates. 
 
Risks 
Risks to the attainment of our price target include slower adoption of TEM and MDM among enterprises, standardization of billing, 
increased competition, and integration risks with M&A strategy.

Disclosure information regarding historical ratings and price targets is available at  http://www.wedbush.com/ResearchDisclosure/DisclosureQ212.pdf 
 
Investment Rating System:   
Outperform: Expect the total return of the stock to outperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Neutral: Expect the total return of the stock to perform in-line with the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) coverage 
universe over the next 6-12 months. 
Underperform: Expect the total return of the stock to underperform relative to the median total return of the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team) 
coverage universe over the next 6-12 months. 
 
The Investment Ratings are based on the expected performance of a stock (based on anticipated total return to price target) relative to the 
other stocks in the analyst’s coverage universe (or the analyst’s team coverage).* 
 
Rating Distribution                                                  Investment Banking Relationships 
(as of June 30, 2012)                                                (as of June 30, 2012) 
Outperform:58%                                                       Outperform:14% 
Neutral: 36%                                                         Neutral: 0%

The Distribution of Ratings is required by FINRA rules; however, WS’ stock ratings of Outperform, Neutral, and Underperform most closely 
conform to Buy, Hold, and Sell, respectively. Please note, however, the definitions are not the same as WS’ stock ratings are on a relative 
basis.  
 
The  analysts  responsible  for  preparing  research  reports  do  not  receive  compensation  based  on  specific  investment  banking  activity.  The 
analysts receive compensation that is based upon various factors including WS’ total revenues, a portion of which are generated by WS’ 
investment banking activities.
