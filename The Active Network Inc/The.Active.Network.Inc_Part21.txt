Valuation
We value ACTV using a blended approach on our 2012 estimates using 15x EV/EBITDA, a 3% FCF yield and 3.5x revenue. We take
an average of these three metrics to arrive at our $22 price target. These multiples are in range of the rest of our coverage universe, and
we believe they are justified given the high revenue visibility and rapid EBITDA growth.

Price Target Impediment
1) Margin expansion does not play out as expected.
2) Large contracts material to financial statements are lost during periodic re-bidding process.
3) Complications from M&A integration.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.
