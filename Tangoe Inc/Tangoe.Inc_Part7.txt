 Tangoe completed its follow-on offering of 9.2m shares, of which 7m were 
                                                                                            Price/price relative 
 secondary and 2.2m primary, at $18.50 per share.  Business for the company 
 remains strong as integration of recent acquisitions is proceeding well.  We                  20
 believe the company will stay disciplined in its acquisitions as the focus shifts 
 away from scale to geographic and technology-focused assets.  We update our                   16
 model for the new primary shares and reiterate our Buy rating, raising our PT to 
                                                                                               12
 $25 from $20. 
                                                                                                8
 Recent acquisitions were well-chosen 
                                                                                                 7/11                                                                          1/12
 Acquisitions during 2011 were focused on gaining scale.  After the HCL and                            Tangoe, Inc.
 Telwares deals early in the year, Tangoe acquired Profitline in December 2011,                        S&P 500 INDEX (Rebased)   
 gaining about $15m in annual revenue and 50 customers, including Starbucks, 
                                                                                            Performance (%)                             1m          3m        12m
 BASF, NASA, DoD and the US Postal Service, about $5m in annual revenue 
 from the government sector alone.  With almost $35m new scale related                    Absolute 5.3        28.6               
 revenue acquired through these three assets, Anomalous Networks was a                      S&P 500 INDEX                               2.5           9.1           4.9
 purely technology play followed by ttMobiles gets Tangoe about 50 customers    
  and 50 staff very familiar with the UK market.  See page 4 for a summary. 
 Estimates for FY12 leave headroom 
 Early guidance for FY12 embeds about $20m in acquired revenue, effectively 
 about 16% organic growth at the midpoint, whereas recent organic growth has 
 consistently been above 20%.  We believe this leaves adequate headroom for 
 the company to beat estimates as we progress through the year.  The process 
 of integrating acquisitions is fairly standardized at the company, but we note 
 there were five acquisitions in the past 15 months vs. only three in the years 
 prior to 2011. 
 Reiterate Buy rating, raising PT to $25 from $20 
 Our $25 price target (from $20) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of 
 $0.55 (from $0.48), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x (slight premium to group 
 given market leadership position), and an estimated five-year growth rate, net 
 of dilution, of 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed 
 profitability from new projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking 
 expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

Discussion and exhibits 

Tangoe completes secondary 

Tangoe completed its follow-on offering of 9.2m shares, of which 7m were secondary 
and 2.2m were primary, at $18.50 per share.  Business for the company remains strong 
as integration of recent acquisitions is proceeding well.  We believe the company will 
stay disciplined in its acquisitions as the focus shifts away from scale to geographic and 
technology-focused assets.  We update our model for the new primary shares and 
reiterate our Buy rating, raising our PT to $25 from $20.

Progress since IPO 
Below we list significant developments since the companys IPO: 

         Tangoe went public on July 27, 2011, issuing 8.8m shares (7.5m primary) at 
         $10.  Green shoe of 1.3m secondary shares was exercised 

         Two quarters of beat-and-raise since IPO 

         Three acquisitions since going public 

         Spend under management went from about $14bn to about $17bn 

         Customer count grew from 615 to 750 

         Employee count grew from 757 to about 1,000 

         Tangoe has been positioned as a Leader in Gartners Magic Quadrant report 
         published in March 2012 

Recent acquisitions were well-chosen 
Acquisitions during 2011 were focused on gaining scale.  After the HCL and Telwares 
deals early in the year, Tangoe acquired Profitline in December 2011, gaining about 
$15m in annual revenue and 50 customers, including Starbucks, BASF, NASA, DoD and 
the US Postal Service, about $5m in annual revenue from the government sector alone.  
With almost $35m new scale related revenue acquired through these three assets, 
Anomalous Networks was a purely technology play followed by ttMobiles, which gets 
Tangoe about 50 customers  and 50 staff very familiar with the UK market.  Two 
smaller remaining players in the TEM sector are Symphony SMS (part of Symphony 
Service Corp, an outsourcing vendor) and Rivermine, now part of IBM after its 
acquisition of Emptoris.

 Estimates for FY12 leave headroom 
 Early guidance for FY12 embeds about $20m in acquired revenue, effectively about 16% 
 organic growth at the midpoint, whereas recent organic growth has consistently been 
 above 20%.  We believe this leaves adequate headroom for the company to beat 
 estimates as we progress through the year.  The process of integrating acquisitions is 
 fairly standardized at the company, but we note there were five acquisitions in the past 
 15 months vs. only three in the years prior to 2011. 

 Customers from the HCL and Telwares acquisitions are beginning to be migrated after 
 the businesses themselves were integrated into Tangoe.  With over half of Tangoes 
 staff in customer-facing roles, we expect customer migration to be fairly smooth, but 
 like with other software migrations, the process can often depend on the needs and 
 internal processes at the individual customers.  Profitline customers are more likely to 
 be migrated next year, as its still early days since the acquisition.  

 Figure 4 below shows the organic growth profile of the company since 2008.  Inorganic 
 contribution in FY11 was $19.9m and the companys guidance for FY12 embeds about 
 $20m in acquired revenue, about $14.5m from Profitline, $1m from Anomalous 
 Networks and $4.5m from ttMobiles.

Figure 4 plots organic growth for total revenue and recurring revenue.  We note that the 
company doesnt disclose organic recurring revenue separately.  We assume that of the 
$19.9m in total inorganic revenue in FY11, about $17.5m was recurring, with the rest in 
consulting or professional services.

 Reiterate Buy rating, raising PT to $25 from $20 

 Our $25 price target (from $20) is based on a CY13 uFCF/share estimate of $0.55 (from 
 $0.48), an EV/uFCF/G multiple of 1.2x, and an estimated five-year growth rate, net of 
 dilution, of 33%. Risks include integration of acquisitions, delayed profitability from new 
 projects not ramping fast enough and customers taking expense processing in-house 
 after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

Deutsche Bank may engage in securities transactions, on a proprietary basis or otherwise, in a manner inconsistent with the view taken in this research report. In addition, others within Deutsche Bank, including 
strategists and sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this report constitute the current judgement of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change 
without notice. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof in the event that any opinion, forecast or estimate set forth herein, changes or

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within  the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies 
to value the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for 
"Hold" rated stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at 
http://gm.db.com to determine the target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price 
fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not 
necessarily indicative of future results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy f rom customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a 
proprietary basis.
