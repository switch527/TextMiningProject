   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $45.22.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $39 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of return
   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $45.90.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Investment Thesis 

TLLP is a fee-based, growth-oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to own, operate and 
acquire crude oil and refined products logistic s assets. In other words, TLLP was formed 
to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its l      ogistics infrastructure business. Initially, 
substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under various 
long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume commitments. 
Over the next several years, there is visible   growth from, 1) organic projects tied to its 
strategies in the Bakken shale; 2) multi-year  inventories of dropdown assets from Tesoro 
Corp, and the 3) development of third party businesses. 

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.7 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 51% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights. 

Additional Color 

■   Management Guidance. 

    o   1Q12 growth capital spending s     hould approximate $7mm plus $1mm for 
    maintenance capex. 

    o     1Q12 EBITDA should approximate $14 to $15  million. Additional pipeline repairs 
    are expected to total $0.5mm. 

■   Growth in Trucking Volumes:  TLLP relied more on third party trucking services in 
    4Q11 to move incremental Bakken crude to Tesoro Corps (TSO) Anacortes refinery. It 
    is significantly cheaper to use its proprie tary fleet and management targets reducing 
    third party contracts from 65% (in 4Q11) to 10-20%. 

■   Growth Projects Update:   Management provided detail on its estimated capital 
    expenditure to be spent over the next 2 years. The projects totaling $105mm are 
    expected to generate annual EBITDA of $42.5mm.  As noted earlier, the value of the 
    Martinez terminal dropdown will be $80mm and future dropdowns totaling $50mm 
    every year going ahead.

■     Credit and Liquidity.   As of 12/31/2011, TLLP had total liquidity of $108.3mm 
      including $8.3mm in cash and $100mm available under its credit facility. The company 
      expects to increase its credit facility to $300mm (from $150mm) in 2Q12 concurrent 
      with the dropdown of the Martinez terminal.  

■     Potential Dropdowns from Tesoro Provide Visible Growth Opportunities.  Tesoro 
      still has logistics assets with total aggr  egate book value of $240 million that may be 
      sold to TLLP. This compares to approximately $193 million for the initial assets 
      contributed to TLLP. Furthermore, Tesoro announced a project to deliver 30,000 bpd 
      of Bakken crude oil to its Anacortes refinery via rail on 7/15/2011. Tesoro will build an 
      unloading facility to accommodate the unit trai                         n. Once completed, Tesoro plans to 
      offer the facility to TLLP.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O): The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute total return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the average total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the analyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculation and a 15% and a 
7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and 7.5% thresholds 
replace the +10-15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. 
**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, 
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward.  
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
*An analysts coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $36 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, 
distribution compounded annual growth rate of 13.1% over the next five years and 6.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth rate of 
1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $36 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destruction and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

This report is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction 
where such distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Credit Suisse AG, the Swiss bank, or its subsidiaries or its affiliates 
(CS) to any registration or licensing requirement within such jurisdiction. All material presented in this report, unless specifically indicated otherwise, is under copyright to CS. None of 
the material, nor its content, nor any copy of it, may be altered in any way, transmitted to, copied or distributed to any other party, without the prior express written permission of CS. All

The information, tools and material presented in this report are provided to you for information purposes only and are not to be used or considered as an offer or the solicitation of an 
offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report 
constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appropriate to your individual circumstances or otherwise 
constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or completeness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this report. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.

        4Q11 Results Overview   

        Tesoro Logistics Partners (TLLP) reported 4Q11 results that were below expectations primarily due to higher costs in the Crude Oil 

        Gathering segment related to maintenance repairs on the High Plains system and higher utilization of third-party trucking capacity in 

        the Bakken. Exhibit 1 provides an overview of 4Q11 results compared to prior quarters and RBC expectations.

       $100 million in 2013. For scale, the partnership had guided to a base annual EBITDA run-rate of $53 million at the time of the April 

       2011 IPO. As shown below, the organic growth portfolio has a highly attractive return profile. In addition to the Martinez Crude 

       Terminal (~$8 million in annual EBITDA), TLLP maintains significant optionality to acquire ROFO (Right of First Offer) drop-down 

       assets from TSO amounting to 125% of the original book value of the partnership (including Martinez). Our current estimate of ~$15 

       million of drop-down EBITDA in 2012/2013 represents only 20–30% of the total available ROFO EBITDA of $50–80 million.

       New Estimates Still Imply Leading Distribution Growth    

       As shown below, TLLP guided 1Q 2012 EBITDA below our original expectation of $17.1 million on elevated third-party trucking 

       costs and refined product seasonality in the Terminalling, Transport and Storage segment. However, management expects to increase 

       proprietary trucking utilization during 2012 and has guided for significant volume growth on the High Plains system in the second half

Valuation
We derive our 12-month price target of $36 for TLLP using our multi-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our DDM is based
on our distribution estimates for the four quarters starting one year out followed by a five-year growth rate of 10%, which, from the
current distribution, implies a five-year CAGR of 15.9%. Our long-term distribution schedule assumes that over the subsequent 11
years growth converges to the 1% perpetual rate. We discount our distributions at a 8.5% discount rate, which incorporates our interest
rate expectations and a risk premium based on TLLP-specific risks and is consistent with an Average risk qualifier. Our $36 price
target implies a yield of 5.2% on our one-year-out annualized distribution of $1.86 per unit.
Price Target Impediment
Key issues that could impede our price target include acquisition risk; damage to pipeline infrastructure; commodity price risks; and
competing pipeline solutions in the Bakken. TLLP is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any
inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro would negatively impact results. Other risks include prolonged declines in volumes,
interest rates, regulatory risk, and relatively low trading liquidity.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth-oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies, and Alaska, with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents analyst's best idea in the sector; expected to provide significant absolute total return over 12 months with a
favorable risk-reward ratio.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trade Ideas

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.

                                          fourth quarter of 2011. The distribution represents a 3.6% increase over the $0.35/unit ($1.40/
                                          unit annualized) for the third quarter of 2011.
                                          We are maintaining our 2012 distribution estimate at $1.575/unit and our 2013 distribution
                                          estimate at $1.83/unit. Our estimates provide a 16.2% growth rate in 2013. This compares quite
                                          favorably to the 7.1% estimated average growth in 2013 for liquids-based partnerships under
                                          our coverage. Our distributable cash flow estimates are $2.12/unit for 2012 and $2.60/unit in
                                          2013, which equates to coverage ratios of 1.3x and 1.4x, respectively.

                                         Estimates
                                         We are lowering our 2012 EBITDA estimate to $75.8 million from $79.6 million and keeping
                                         our 2013 EBITDA estimate at $100.1 million. We are reducing our 2012 DCF estimate to $66.3
                                         million from $69.4 million and maintaining our 2013 DCF estimate at $83.7 million. Our higher
                                         estimates primarily reflect slightly higher costs in 2012.

   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $38.08.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Q4 Takeaways 
 
     •    Activity levels in the Bakken Shale remain st             rong. In Q4, TLLP hand          led incremental volumes 
          primarily through third-party truck  carriers, which resulted in higher operating costs. Management 
          plans to increase the utilization of TLLPs proprietary trucking operations in Q1 and add to its fleet in 
          the spring to handle the anticipated ramp-up in vo              lumes. Managements target is to increase the 
          trucking mix to approximately 80-90% proprietar y/10-20% third party from  about 35% proprietary 
          in Q4 2011. 
 
     •    Management provided Q1 2012 EBITDA guidance of $14-15MM. Capex should approximate $8MM 
          including $1MM of maintenance capex. 
 
     •    TLLP plans to fund the Q2 dropdown of the Martinez  crude oil terminal with borrowings on its credit 
          facility. The partnership expects to expand the size            of its facility to $300MM concurrent with the 
          acquisition.  
 
Q4 2011 Results Modestly Below Our Forecast 
 
TLLP reported Q4 2011 EBITDA of $14.1MM versus our estimate of $15.6MM and consensus of $15.2MM. The 
slight variance from our forecast was primarily attributable to higher-than-expected operating and 
maintenance and G&A expenses (i.e. $13.7MM versus ou                  r estimate of $10.7MM). The impact of higher Q4 
expenses was partially offset by higher-than-anticipated revenue from both the crude oil gathering and 
terminalling segments (i.e. $27.8MM versus our esti  mate of $26.2MM). The partnership reported EPU of 
$0.37 versus our estimate and consensus of $0.40. 
 
Q4 DCF per unit was $0.40 versus our estimate of $0.44.  TLLP raised its distribution 3.6% sequentially to 
$0.3625 per unit, in line with our expectations. Q4 di             stribution coverage was 1.1x  (or excess cash flow of 
$1.3MM).

Crude oil gathering segment EBITDA was $6.6MM versus our estimate of $7.4MM. Q4 expenses were higher 
than anticipated due to repairs on the High Plains Pipeline and third-party trucking costs. However, revenue 
exceeded our expectations based on both stronger-than-anticipated pipeline throughput and average revenue 
per bbl. Q4 pipeline volumes averaged 60,064 bbls/d (versus our estimate of 59,530 bbls/d) and average 
pipeline revenue per bbl increased to $1.37 (versus our estimate and the Q3 rate of $1.35). Trucking volumes 
also exceeded our expectations and increased 13% sequentially to 27,007 bbls/d (versus our estimate of 23,879 
bbls/d).  
 
Terminalling, transportation and stor age segment EBITDA was $9.0MM, which was in line with our forecast. 
The impact of slightly higher-than-anticipated term            inalling volumes of 137,378 bbls/d (compared to our 
estimate of 134,852 bbls/d) and revenue per bbl of $0.79 (versus our estimate of $0.77) essentially offset the 
impact of slightly higher-than-forecast operating and maintenance expense in Q4.  
 
2013 EBITDA Guidance Reaffirmed--Dropdown/Projects Remain On Track 
 
Management continues to expect TLLP will generate $100MM of EBITDA in 2013, which is a meaningful 
increase from the partnerships current run rate of approximately $62MM. The anticipated improvement in 
cash flow is supported by contributions from approximately $100MM of identified organic growth investments 
scheduled to be placed in service in 2012-13. In general, the timing of and total capital expenditures remain 
unchanged from managements previous guidance communicated on December 5, 2011. However, we note that 
management increased the projected EBITDA associated with these investments to $42.5MM from $30MM 
due, in part, to higher anticipated volumes for the Stockton terminal storage and LA terminal permit 
expansion projects. We calculate an attractive average EB ITDA multiple of 2.4x for TLLPs portfolio of growth 
projects.

TLLPs 2013 EBITDA guidance also reflects an $8MM                benefit from the pending ac quisition of the Martinez 
crude oil marine terminal from its GP sponsor Tesoro  Corp (TSO). Management indicated that the drop-down 
remains on track to occur in early Q2 2012 but has not  disclosed the acquisition price. For modeling purposes, 
we are assuming an acquisition price of $75MM (or a 9.375x EBITDA multiple). 
  
Outlook For 2012 Unchanged--Introducing Our 2013 Forecast 
 
We are maintaining our 2012 DCF per unit and distribution per unit estimates of $2.09 and $1.61, respectively. 
TLLP should be able to deliver distribution growth of            16% year over year and generate a solid distribution 
coverage ratio of 1.3x. For 2012, we forecast TLLP wi ll generate EBITDA of $74.6MM, which represents a 29% 
($17MM) increase over proforma 2011 results. The anticipated year-over-year improvement is driven primarily

For 2013, we forecast EBITDA and DCF per unit of                         $109.9MM and $2.66, respectively. We estimate TLLP 
could deliver distribution growth of  24.3% in 2013 and generate a covera ge ratio of approximately 1.3x. Our 
2013 forecast is predicated on: (1) an assumed $100MM dropdown in Q1 2013 (at an EBITDA multiple of 10x), 
(2) a full-year benefit from $22MM of  growth projects to be completed in  2012, and (3) a partial-year benefit 
from $79MM of investments that are expected to be in service in 2013.

No Change To Our Valuation Range Of $35-37 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is predicated on a combination of   a dividend discount model and price-to-DCF multiple. 
Our DDM yields a valuation of $37 per unit, and assumes  a long-term distribution growth rate of 1.25%, and a 
required rate of return of 8.5%. The low-end of our va  luation range reflects a pric e-to-DCF multiple of about 
16.5x our 2012 DCF per unit estimate. Risks to TLLP                       trading in our valuation range include: a slower-than-
forecasted rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.

                                       Organic projects and dropdowns support growth 
                                       TLLP has approximately $97mm of organic pr            ojects (net of parent reimbursements) 
                                       through 2013. In addition, TLLP plans to do        its first dropdown in early 2Q11, which we 
                                       estimate at $65mm. The combined $162mm of or ganic projects and dropdown is expected 
                                       to generate approximately $50mm or an attrac          tive blended multiple of 3.2x (assuming 
                                       organic projects at 2.3x and dropdown at 8.0x). Cash flow stability from the expansion 
                                       capex is supported by long-term contracts with TSO.  

                                       In December 2011, TLLP announced $80mm of  new organic projects, comprised of crude 
                                       gathering and truck volume expansions in           the Bakken and refined product terminal 
                                       expansions. In the Bakken, TLLP is adding         approximately $53mm of new projects to 
                                       increase crude gathering capacity on its High         Plains system and trucking capacity to 
                                       accommodate TSO’s growing demand for Ba  kken crude. Combining TSO’s 10,000 bpd 
                                       Mandan refinery expansion, 30,000 bpd Anacort es rail project and gathering expansions in 
                                       the Bakken, TLLP’s High Plains system is expected to add 50,000 bpd of new volumes by 
                                       2013, raising its total volumes to more than 100,000 bpd. 

                                       On the trucking side, TLLP is expanding its fleet and expects volumes to increase 10,000 
                                       bpd to 35,000 bpd by 2013. In addition, TLLP        lengthened its trucking contract with TSO 
                                       from 2 years to 5 years and increased mini mum volume commitments from 22,000 bpd to 
                                       27,000 bpd in 2012 and 32,000 bpd in 2013. The remaining new projects comprise 
                                       approximately $27mm for terminal expansions   at Los Angeles, Stockton and Mandan. 
                                       Including previously announced storage proj        ects, TLLP plans to invest approximately 
                                       $40mm on terminal projects through 2013, wh           ich is expected to increase volumes by 
                                       40,000 bpd to approximately 185,000 bpd.

                                        First dropdown expected early 2Q12 
                                        Management announced the first dropdown will be the Martinez, CA crude oil marine 
                                        terminal serving TSO’s 166,000 bpd Golden Eagle  refinery (TSO’s largest refinery). Expected 
                                        close is early 2Q12. While management did not provide a purchase price (terms still being 
                                        discussed), we assume a pric  e tag of approximately $65mm based on 8x multiple on 
                                        EBITDA of $8mm.  

                                        The Martinez crude oil marine terminal is       comprised of 145,000 bpd of wharf capacity, 
                                        425,000 bpd of storage capacity and interconnecting pipes. Similar to other TLLP assets, the 
                                        Martinez terminal cash flows will be supported by a 10-year contract with TSO with 
                                        minimum volume commitment for 90% of projected volumes of 70,000  bpd. Given TLLP’s 
                                        high liquidity ($100mm of availability on $150mm revolver) and low leverage (Debt/EBITDA 
                                        1x), we expect the dropdown and growth projec  ts to be financed with debt. In addition, 
                                        TLLP anticipates expanding its revolver from  $150mm to $300mm in association with the 
                                        Martinez dropdown.  

                                        4Q Review 
                                        Q4 EBITDA $14.1mn vs. our estimate of $15.5mn and consensus $15.3mn. Distributable 
                                        cash flow was $12.6mn vs. our $13.5mn estimate. Variance to our estimates was 
                                        attributable to higher operating expenses more  than offsetting higher crude pipeline and 
                                        trucking volumes. Costs increased due to higher third-party trucking costs and repairs to 
                                        the High Plains Pipeline (from last summer rain). The Partnership increased its quarterly 
                                        distribution 3.6% QoQ and 7.4% above its initial quarterly distribution, to $0.3625 per unit 
                                        ($1.45 annualized), above our $0.35 estimate. Distribution coverage came in at 1.11x.

Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 07-Feb-2012, USD 33.38), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect       or (the "sector
coverage universe"). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors 
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or 
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i       n an advisory
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $33 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of return
   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $38.08.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Raising TLLP Valuation To $31-33 Per Unit On Accelerated Distr. Growth Outlook 
           
We are raising our valuation range to $31-33 from $26-              28 per unit to reflect a higher forecast five-year 
distribution compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of               14.1% versus our previous estimate of 10.0%. Our 
accelerated distribution growth outl ook is supported by TLLPs higher-t           han-anticipated growth capex budget 
for 2011-13 (i.e. $100MM versus our previous estimate of $68MM), which is also expected to generate a more-
attractive average return relative to our previous assumption (i.e. EBITDA multiple of 3.3x versus our previous 
estimate of 3.8x). For 2011-16, we are now forecasting  total growth capex of $299MM at an average return of 
4.3x EBITDA, up from our previous estimate of $143MM of expenditures at an average return of 4.7x EBITDA. 
 
We are also assuming TLLPs first dropdown (i.e. the Martinez crude oil marine terminal) will be a $75MM 
acquisition (or a 9.375x EBITDA multiple) to be comple  ted by Q2 2012 versus our previous assumption of a 
$100MM transaction consummated at a 10x EBITDA multip le in Q1 2012. We continue to forecast a $100MM 
dropdown in 2013 and $150MM of annual dropdowns at an EBITDA multiple of 10x in 2014-16.   
 
Our valuation range of $31-33 per unit is predicated   on a combination of a divi dend discount model (DDM) 
and price-to-DCF multiple.  Our DDM yields a valuation of $33 per unit, and assumes a long-term distribution 
growth rate of 1.25%, and a required rate of return of 9.0%. The low-end of our valuation range reflects a price-
to-DCF multiple of about 15x our 2012 DCF per unit es  timate of $2.10. Risks to the units trading below our 
range include slower-than-forecast rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.

TLLP currently yields 4.4% and trades at 2011E and 2012 E price-to-distributable cash flow multiples of 17.5x 
and 15.1x, respectively. This compares to small-cap pipe line MLP peer group medians  of 7.2%, 10.9x, and 9.6x 
respectively. On a price/DCF-to-growth (analogous to PEG) basis, TLLP is trading at an attractive ratio of 0.8x,

Our Distribution Forecast Could Prove Conservative Based On TLLPs Target Coverage Ratio 
 
TLLP targets a distribution coverage ratio of 1.1x. Based  on our 2012 and 2013 coverage ratio forecasts of 1.3x, 
this suggests that annual distribution growth in 2012  and 2013 could exceed our estimates of 16% and 24%, 
respectively, if management opts to pa y out more cash flow, in line with its coverage target. We estimate that 
TLLP could increase its 2012 and 2013 distribution            per unit by 32% and 20%, respectively, assuming a 
distribution coverage ratio of 1.1x. Under this scenar  io, however, the projected five-year distribution CAGR 
remains 14%, as TLLPs higher near-term growth potentia l is essentially offset by lower growth rates for the 
later years. Hence, our DDM-based valuation of $33 per unit would be unchanged.

Notably, TSOs analyst/investor day presentation on December 5, 2011, contains a slide on the companys 
expectations for the equity value of TLLP to increase to $1.4B in 2013 from $0.7B at its IPO. Growth of $0.7B 
in value appears to be split about two-thirds to th        e LP units and one-third to   the GP, which implies an 
incremental GP equity value of approximately $235MM. As suming a cash flow multiple of 22x for the GP, this 
would imply approximately $11MM of distributions to th            e GP in 2013. This is in line with the estimated 
distributions to the GP based on a 2013 distribution per  unit of $2.21 assuming a distribution coverage ratio of 
1.1x (see Figure 3). Assuming a 2013 GP equity value of about $235MM, the 2013 LP equity value would 
approximate $1.165B, or $38.18 per LP unit ($1.165B/30.5MM units). Based on a 2013 distribution per unit of 
$2.21 (under the 1.1x coverage scenario) and a stock pr         ice of $38.18 for TLLP, this implies a yield of 5.8% 
versus the current yield of 4.4%.

$100MM Of Organic Investments Should Yield                            Attractive Returns And Significant Volume 
Growth 
 
TLLP plans to invest $100MM of growth capex throug                    h 2013 and expects the projects will generate an 
incremental $30MM of EBITDA, which implies an attrac  tive average multiple of 3.3x. The partnership has 
earmarked 60% of the expenditures to grow its Bakken bu siness (High Plains System), which should result in 
an increase of about 50Mbbls/d in   gathering volumes (i.e. total estima ted volumes to exceed 100MBbls/d 
versus 59.5Mbbls/d in Q3 2011) and an increase of ab              out 11Mbbls/d in trucking vo lumes (i.e. total estimated 
volumes of 35Mbbls/d versus 23.9Mbbls/d in Q3 2011)  by 2013. The remaining $40MM of growth capex are 
related to projects to expand TLLPs terminal capaciti es and services, which should increase volumes by more 
than 40Mbbls/d by year-end 2013.

Crude Oil Gathering (High Plains System) . TLLP has budgeted growth capex of $60MM tied to organic 
growth opportunities in the Bakken Shale, which is ex pected to generate $20-25MM of incremental EBITDA. 
TSO is undertaking an expansion of its Mandan Refi                   nery to increase the capacity to 68Mbbls/d from 
58Mbbls/d in H1 2012. As the primar  y source of supply to the refinery, TLLPs High Plains System should 
realize a 10Mbbls/d increase in gathering volumes when the expansion is placed in service. Additionally, TSO 
is constructing a unit train (loading and unloading facilities and dedicated rail cars) to deliver up to 30Mbbls/d 
of Bakken crude oil to its Anacortes refinery by the en             d of 2012. Management anticipates that this project 
should result in an increase of 30Mbbls/d in High Pl            ains volumes and the assets (when completed) would be 
added to TLLPs portfolio of dropdown candidates. TLLP also plans to invest capital to connect the High Plains 
System to alternative destinations, which should add 10Mbbls/d of throughput beginning in 2012. 
 
The partnership intends to expand its trucking fleet to help alleviate takeaway constraints in the Bakken. 
Management expects trucking volumes will increase to   35Mbbls/d from 23.9Mbbls/d in Q3 2011. Notably, 
TLLP has amended its trucking agreement with TSO, which provides for a longer term and higher fixed 
minimum volume commitments. The partnership is to ch                    arge a mileage-based trucking rate, ranging from 
$1.95-4.71 per barrel, and a dispatch fee of $0.50-0.55  per barrel instead of a per barrel-based trucking rate, 
which we estimate is $2.72 per barrel currently. The mileage-based rate is to be adjusted annually based on the 
rates of third-party trucking carriers  transporting crude oil in Montana and North Dakota (subject to certain 
stated restrictions).

Crude Oil Takeaway Constraints Are Creating Increased Gathering Opportunities 
 
Similar to TLLP, other MLPs have benefitted from higher lease gathering margin in areas where crude oil 
production is regionally constrained.  Demand for infrastructure to transp ort crude production to market has 
increased, particularly in the new emerging shale plays. This demand has increased the value of the 
crude/lease gathering services, allowing crude gatherers (such as Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. [PAA] and 
Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. [SXL ]) to increase margin for gathered barrels. The increase in demand for 
crude lease gathering services is also being driven, in part, by the spread between WTI and Brent (or LLS) 
crude prices, incentivizing producers to pay a premium to deliver their production barrels to market.  
 
MLPs have responded to the increase in takeaway de   mand by expanding crude ga thering infrastructure; for 
example, several MLPs have ordered additional crude gathering trucks. PAA intends to expand its fleet by 34%, 
adding 180 trucks in 2011 to a current fleet of 530 truc ks within its supply and logistics segment. SXL plans to 
expand its truck fleet to 200 by year-end from approximately 140. 
 
We anticipate logistical constraints in crude oil shale plays to persist over the next 12-18 months as regional 
production outpaces takeaway capacity. While lease gath ering margin could decline  as additional trucks are 
placed into service, we believe overall lease gathering cash flow should remain at elevated levels in 2012 as 
MLPs would essentially be swapping margin for higher volume. Given the recurring nature of this margin, we 
believe MLPs are likely to pay out the increase in lease gathering profits in the form of higher distributions. 
 
Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage. TLLP is investing $40MM of growth capex through 2013 to 
expand its terminal capacities and services. The in   vestments should generate  $5-10MM of incremental 
EBITDA and increase terminalling volumes by more than 40Mbbls/d by year-end 2013. The partnership plans 
to expand the capacity at the Los Angeles, Mandan, an d Stockton terminals and gr ow third-party volumes at 
Boise, Burley, Vancouver, and Stockton. The partnership  also plans to continue its infrastructure optimization 
efforts (e.g. Los Angeles) and has b een successfully in generating an in cremental 20Mbbls/d in volumes thus 
far in 2011.  
 
Details On First Dropdown--Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal 
         
TLLP plans to acquire the Martinez Crude Oil (Golden Ea gle) Marine Terminal located in Martinez, California, 
from its GP sponsor TSO. The terminal is located on the Sacramento River near the Golden Eagle Refinery (see 
description below) and has access to the San Francisco Ba y. Assets include a dock, five crude oil storage tanks 
with 425Mbbls of capacity, and related pipelines. Th   e facility supplies TSOs Golden Eagle refinery and 
Martinez Terminal with crude oil from marine vessels. The wharf capacity is 145Mbbls/d. The projected 
volume is 70Mbbls/d (48% utilization) and compares to average crude oil throughput of 49.8Mbbls/d in 2010. 
TLLP has secured a ten-year (with  two five-year renewals) fee-based ag reement with TSO with a minimum 
volume commitment on 90% of projected volumes. The transaction is expected to close in early 2012, and is to 
be funded through the partnerships revolving credit facility. 
 
Acquisition Should Be Highly Accretive To DCF 
         
Management projects annual EBITDA from the Martinez terminal asset to be $8MM and annual maintenance 
capex to approximate $0.5MM. Assuming  an acquisition cost of $75MM, this implies an EBITDA multiple of 
9.4x. Notably, we estimate a $75MM cost for the drop  down based on managements  guidance of $1.5MM of 
incremental annual DD&A expense and the implied average depreciable life of 50 years assumed for TLLPs 
identified growth projects (i.e. $1.5MM x 50 year  s=$75MM). Our previous model incorporated a $100MM 
dropdown in Q1 2012 at an EBITDA multiple of 10.0x. 
 
We estimate the acquisition could be about $0.17 accret  ive to DCF per unit predicated on the partnerships 
financing plans (i.e. 100% with its credit facility). Ou r accretion forecast assumes 2012 annualized EBITDA of 
$8MM, in line with guidance, 100% short-term financing, an average interest rate of 3.1% on TLLPs revolving 
credit facility, and maintenance cape x of $0.5MM (or 6.25% of EBITDA), in line with guidance. Notably, we 
estimate the accretion to DCF per unit decreases to about $0.08 assuming 50% equity/50% debt financing at a 
yield of 4.4% and long term interest rate of 7.5%.

Overview of TSOs Martinez Refinery 
                
TSOs Martinez, California, (Golden Eagle) refinery       is located approximately 30 miles northeast of San 
Francisco on 2,206 acres in Martinez, California. It is TSOs largest refinery and the second-largest refinery in 
northern California, with 166Mbbls/d of refining capacity. In 2010, the Martinez refinery processed an average 
of 124Mbbls/d of crude oil and other feedstock. It pr                                         oduces transportation fuels including CARB gasoline, 
CARB diesel fuel, conventional gasoline, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and petroleum coke. 
                
The Martinez refinery receives crude oil from numerous  proprietary and third-party assets. It receives foreign, 
Alaskan, and California crude oil through its two mari                                         ne terminals, which have access to the San Francisco 
Bay, and third-party pipelines. Martin ezs refined products are distribute d through TLLPs Stockton and soon 
to be acquired Martinez terminals, TSOs marine and refined products terminal, and third-party terminals. 
 
Balance Sheet/Liquidity Update 
                
The partnership had $118MM of liquidity (including cash) as of the end of Q3 2011. TLLPs 2012 total debt 
should approximate $177MM (i.e. $51MM outstanding at year-end 2011, $75MM for the Martinez terminal 
acquisition, and $51MM of 2012 orga  nic capex spending net of excess cash flow. We believe that TLLP will 
exercise the accordion feature of its credit facility to increase the size to $300MM. This would provide the 
partnership with the flexibility to undertake additional                                         acquisitions and organic growth initiatives without 
issuing long-term debt or equity next year. We forecast   that the partnership could end 2012 with a pro forma 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3x.

Raising 2012 And 2013 DCF Estimates 
 
We are raising our 2012 and 2013 DCF per unit estima                                 tes to $2.10 and $2.66, respectively, from $1.98 and 
$2.18. Our 2011 DCF per estimate of $1.81 is unchange d. Our 2013 EBITDA forecast of $101MM (excluding a 
$10MM benefit from our $100MM dropdown assumption in Q1 2013) is essentially in line with managements 
guidance of $100MM. We are also increasing our 2012                                 and 2013 distribution per unit estimates to $1.61 and 
$2.00, respectively, from $1.59 and $1.83.  
 
Our revised 2012 and 2013 DCF estimates reflect the net impact of the following adjustments/assumptions: 
 
      1)    Estimated annualized EBITDA contribution of $8  MM from the acquisition of  the Martinez marine 
             terminal assuming the transaction cost $75MM and closes by Q2 2012. This compares to our previous 
             $100MM dropdown assumption in Q1  2012 at an EBITDA multiple of 10x (annualized EBITDA of 
             $10MM). 
       
      2)   Forecasted 2011-13 growth capex   of approximately $150MM (inclu ding approximately $50MM of 
             assumed incremental spending above the $100MM of identified projects) and an average return of 
             3.8x EBITDA. This compares to estimated growth capex of $68MM and an average return of 3.8x 
             incorporated in our previous model. 
 
      3)   Lower estimated 2012 interest expense of $4.0MM (versus our previous estimate of $7.1MM) based 
             on a smaller estimated dropdown of $75MM financed                                       on TLLPs credit facility at an estimated 
             interest rate of 3.1%. This compares to our prev  ious estimate of a $100MM acquisition funded with 
             debt at an interest rate of 6.5%.

                                   High return expansion projects support growth 
                                   On 12/5, TLLP announced $80mm of new organic projects and its first drop down. 
                                   Combining $11.5mm of EBITDA from previously  announced organic pr ojects, $18.5mm of 
                                   EBITDA from the new organic projects an     d $8mm from the drop down, 2013 EBITDA 
                                   guidance is $100mm, which is higher than our previous $88mm estimate and up 
                                   significantly from TLLP’s current $62mm run rate. The $80mm of new organic projects are 
                                   expected to be done at attractive multiples of 4X EBITDA and backed by long-term 
                                   contracts with TSO.  

                                   New organic projects in Bakken and West Coast terminals 
                                   The $80mm of new organic projects are compri sed of crude gathering and truck volume 
                                   expansions in the Bakken and refined product terminal expansio  ns. In the Bakken, TLLP is 
                                   adding approximately $53mm of new projects to  increase crude gathering capacity on its 
                                   High Plains system and trucking capacity to accommodate TSO’s growing demand for 
                                   Bakken crude. Combining TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan refinery expansion, 30,000 bpd 
                                   Anacortes rail project and gathering expansions in  the Bakken, TLLP’s High Plains system is 
                                   expected to add 50,000 bpd of new volumes by 2013, raising its total volumes to more than 
                                   100,000 bpd.  

                                   On the trucking side, TLLP is expanding its fleet and expects volumes to increase 10,000 
                                   bpd to 35,000 bpd by 2013. In addition, TLLP   lengthened its trucking contract with TSO 
                                   from 2 years to 5 years and increased mini mum volume commitments from 22,000 bpd to 
                                   27,000 bpd in 2012 and 32,000 bpd in 2013. 

                                   The remaining new projects comprise approximately $27mm for terminal expansions at Los 
                                   Angeles, Stockton and Mandan. Including previously announced storage projects, TLLP will 
                                   invest approximately $40mm on terminal projects through 2013, which is expected to 
                                   increase volumes by 40,000 bpd to approximately 185,000 bpd.  

                                   First drop down expected 1Q12, to be debt financed 
                                   Management announced the first drop down will be the Martinez, CA crude oil marine 
                                   terminal serving TSO’s 166,000 bpd Golden Eagle  refinery (TSO’s largest refinery). Expected 
                                   close is 1Q12. While management did not provide a purchase price (terms still being 
                                   discussed), we assume a pric  e tag of approximately $65mm based on 8x multiple on 
                                   EBITDA of $8mm. 

                                   The Martinez crude oil marine terminal is   comprised of 145,000 bpd of wharf capacity, 
                                   425,000 bpd of storage capacity and interconnecting pipes. Similar to other TLLP assets, the 
                                   Martinez terminal cash flows will be supported by a 10-year contract with TSO with 
                                   minimum volume commitment for 90% of projected volumes of 70,000 bpd.   

                                   Given TLLP’s high liquidity and low leverage, we expect the drop down and growth projects 
                                   to be financed with debt.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors

month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i        n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.

Investment Thesis

We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100% fee-based (low-risk) MLP with significant dropdown and
organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit  distribution  growth  CAGR  for  the  next  several  years  as  TLLP
expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that
provides  exposure  to  Bakken  formation  growth.  We  believe  the  Bakken  is  in  the  very  early  stages  of  development  and  that  TLLP
provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation
We derive our $34.50 price target by combining our DDM ($36 value) with a target yield methodology ($33 value). The
assumptions  underlying  our  DDM  are  stage  one  (years  1  &  2)  growth  of  12%,  stage  two  (years  3-5)  growth  of  12%,  a
terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%. The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.47 and is achieved in
2016. The assumptions underlying our target yield methodology are a forecasted annualized distribution in 4Q12 of $1.65
divided by a target yield of 5%. We assign a 50% weighting to each methodology.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisition
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.

Valuation
We derive our 12-month price target of $35 for TLLP using our multi-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our DDM is based
on our distribution estimates for the four quarters starting one year out followed by a 5-year growth rate of 12%, which, from the
current distribution implies a 5-year CAGR of 17.4%. Our long-term distribution schedule assumes that over the subsequent 11 years
growth converges to the 1% perpetual rate. We discount our distributions at a 9.0% discount rate, which incorporates our interest rate
expectations and a risk premium based on TLLP-specific risks and is consistent with an Average risk qualifier. Our $35 price target
implies a yield of 5.1% on our one year out annualized distribution of $1.80 per unit.

Price Target Impediment
Among the key issues that could impede our price target are:
 Acquisition risk;
 Damage to pipeline infrastructure;
 Commodity price risks;
 TLLP is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro
  would negatively impact results.
 Trading liquidity in the units is relatively low; and
 Other risks, including prolonged declines in volumes, interest rates, and regulatory risk.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies and Alaska with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trade Ideas

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.

                                            Updated 2012 Plan
                                            Tesoro announced its 2012 business plan, which should result in 2013 EBITDA of $100 million.
                                            The highlights of the plan are capital expenditures of $100 million between 2012 and 2013 and
                                            the acquisition of a crude oil terminal from Tesoro Corporation.
                                            The partnership plans to spend $60 million on its High Plains System, which should continue to
                                            benefit from growth in the Bakken. This system should realize benefits from growth at Tesoro
                                            Corporation's Mandan and Anacortes refineries. In addition, the partnership is expanding its
                                            trucking fleet to increase volumes. Capital spending should total $60 million, which should
                                            result in an EBITDA contribution of $20 million to $25 million. The capital spending includes
                                            some previously announced projects.

                                            Spending  on  the  Terminals  segment  is  budgeted  at  $40  million,  which  should  lead  to
                                            an EBITDA contribution of $5 million to $10 million. The partnership's goal is to grow
                                            terminalling volumes over 40,000 barrels per day by the end of 2013.

                                            The  partnership's  first  dropdown  from  its  parent  will  be  the  Martinez  Crude  Oil  Marine
                                            Terminal in Martinez, CA. The asset should generate $8 million in EBITDA annually and is
                                            supported by a 10-year commitment with two five-year renewals. The transaction should close
                                            by the end of 1Q12 or the beginning of 2Q12 and should be financed with Tesoro's credit
                                            facility. The purchase price has not been disclosed yet.

                                            Distribution
                                            We are maintaining our 2011 distribution estimate at $0.9548/unit, increasing our 2012 estimate
                                            to $1.56/unit from $1.54/unit and upping our 2013 estimate to $1.83/unit from $1.70/unit. Our
                                            estimates provide a 17.3% growth rate in 2013. Our distributable cash flow estimate are $2.22/
                                            unit for 2012 and $2.60/unit in 2013, which equates to coverage ratios of 1.4x for both years.
                                            Our estimates do not include any further asset dropdowns.

                                            Estimates
                                            We are keeping our 2011 EBITDA estimate at $42.2 million and increasing our 2012 EBITDA
                                            estimate to $79.6 million from $72.8 million. We are maintaining our 2011 DCF estimate at
                                            $39.5 million upping our 2012 DCF estimate to $69.4 million from $67.1 million.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $33 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of return
   of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $38.08.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Tesoro Logistics L.P. 
Price as of 12/6/2011: $29.53 
 
Sector Rating: Small Cap Pipeline MLPs, Overweight 
 
 
TLLP announced preliminary financial expectations for 2013. Net      ­net, the guidance is positive and above our prior
expectations. In total, the partnership expects to generate $100MM of EBITDA in 2013, which is above our previous estimate
of $83MM (excluding our assumed 2013 drop  ­down of $100MM). Growth will be supported by a combination of organic
growth expenditures and an expected 2012 drop  ­down of the Martinez Crude Oil Marine terminal from the GP sponsor
Tesoro Corp. (TSO). While the size of the potential 2012 drop down appears to be smaller than our previous estimate (i.e.
$80MM assuming a 10x multiple versus our previous estimate of $100MM), TLLP's growth capex budget for 2012           ­13 of
$100MM is well above our previous forecast of $56MM. We maintain our positive outlook on TLLP and our Outperform
rating. 
 
First Drop­Down Identified. TLLP expects to acquire the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal in 2012 as its first 2012 drop ­
down from sponsor TSO. Management anticipates additional drop ­downs throughout 2012 and 2013. The acquisition will be
funded through available capacity on the partnership's revolving credit facility. The Martinez Marine Terminal has a
projected volume of 70,000 Bbl/d, a wharf capacity of 145,000 Bbl/d, storage capacity of 425,000 Bbl/d, and transportation
pipelines connected to Tesoro's Martinez, CA Refinery.  The partnership has contracted a ten­year commitment (i.e. two five­
year renewals) with committed capacity equal to 90% of projected volumes. TLLP projects the asset will generate $8MM in
annual EBITDA with $0.5MM of annual maintenance capital expenditures. Assuming the asset is sold to TLLP at a 10x
EBITDA multiple, the drop down could total approximately $80MM.

Price as of 12/6/2011: $29.53 
 
Sector Rating: Small Cap Pipeline MLPs, Overweight 
 
 
TLLP announced preliminary financial expectations for 2013. Net      ­net, the guidance is positive and above our prior
expectations. In total, the partnership expects to generate $100MM of EBITDA in 2013, which is above our previous estimate
of $83MM (excluding our assumed 2013 drop  ­down of $100MM). Growth will be supported by a combination of organic
growth expenditures and an expected 2012 drop  ­down of the Martinez Crude Oil Marine terminal from the GP sponsor
Tesoro Corp. (TSO). While the size of the potential 2012 drop down appears to be smaller than our previous estimate (i.e.
$80MM assuming a 10x multiple versus our previous estimate of $100MM), TLLP's growth capex budget for 2012           ­13 of
$100MM is well above our previous forecast of $56MM. We maintain our positive outlook on TLLP and our Outperform
rating. 
 
First Drop­Down Identified. TLLP expects to acquire the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal in 2012 as its first 2012 drop ­
down from sponsor TSO. Management anticipates additional drop ­downs throughout 2012 and 2013. The acquisition will be
funded through available capacity on the partnership's revolving credit facility. The Martinez Marine Terminal has a
projected volume of 70,000 Bbl/d, a wharf capacity of 145,000 Bbl/d, storage capacity of 425,000 Bbl/d, and transportation
pipelines connected to Tesoro's Martinez, CA Refinery.  The partnership has contracted a ten­year commitment (i.e. two five­
year renewals) with committed capacity equal to 90% of projected volumes. TLLP projects the asset will generate $8MM in
annual EBITDA with $0.5MM of annual maintenance capital expenditures. Assuming the asset is sold to TLLP at a 10x
EBITDA multiple, the drop down could total approximately $80MM.

TLLP announced preliminary financial expectations for 2013. Net      ­net, the guidance is positive and above our prior
expectations. In total, the partnership expects to generate $100MM of EBITDA in 2013, which is above our previous estimate
of $83MM (excluding our assumed 2013 drop  ­down of $100MM). Growth will be supported by a combination of organic
growth expenditures and an expected 2012 drop  ­down of the Martinez Crude Oil Marine terminal from the GP sponsor
Tesoro Corp. (TSO). While the size of the potential 2012 drop down appears to be smaller than our previous estimate (i.e.
$80MM assuming a 10x multiple versus our previous estimate of $100MM), TLLP's growth capex budget for 2012           ­13 of
$100MM is well above our previous forecast of $56MM. We maintain our positive outlook on TLLP and our Outperform
rating. 
 
First Drop­Down Identified. TLLP expects to acquire the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal in 2012 as its first 2012 drop ­
down from sponsor TSO. Management anticipates additional drop ­downs throughout 2012 and 2013. The acquisition will be
funded through available capacity on the partnership's revolving credit facility. The Martinez Marine Terminal has a
projected volume of 70,000 Bbl/d, a wharf capacity of 145,000 Bbl/d, storage capacity of 425,000 Bbl/d, and transportation
pipelines connected to Tesoro's Martinez, CA Refinery.  The partnership has contracted a ten­year commitment (i.e. two five­
year renewals) with committed capacity equal to 90% of projected volumes. TLLP projects the asset will generate $8MM in
annual EBITDA with $0.5MM of annual maintenance capital expenditures. Assuming the asset is sold to TLLP at a 10x
EBITDA multiple, the drop down could total approximately $80MM.

Investment Thesis 

TLLP is a fee-based, growth  oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to own, operate and 
acquire crude oil and refined products logistic s assets. In other words, TLLP was formed 
to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its l      ogistics infrastructure business. Initially, 
substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under various 
long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume commitments. 
Over the next several years, there is visible   growth from, 1) organic projects tied to its 
strategies in the Bakken shale; 2) multi year  inventories of dropdown assets from Tesoro 
Corp, and the 3) development of third party businesses.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.5 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 50% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights.

Martinez Crude Oil Terminal Dropdown 

TSO plans to dropdown Martinez Crude Oil Mari ne Terminal to TLLP in early 2012. The 
company projects the EBITDA contribution from the dropdown at about $8 million 
annually. We model the dropdown at an EBITDA   multiple of 10 times, on approximately 
$80 million. TLLP expects to finance the entire   deal with its available revolver (that is 
expandable to $300 million). We have modeled the acquisition as 50/50 debt/equity to be 
conservative, with cost of debt at 6.0% and an annual maintenance capital expenditure of 
$0.5 million. We expect the dropdown to be in the range of $0.07 - 0.11 or 4.4% - 7.4% 
accretive to cash flow, depending on the mu     ltiple of the dropdown transaction. The 
terminals projected volume is 70,000bpd with minimum volume commitments of 
65,000bpd. In addition, the terminal has a wharf capacity of 145,000bpd and storage 
capacity of 425,000 barrels.  

 

Focus on Bakken Shale 

TLLP plans to expand its High Plains system to accommodate increasing crude production 
from the Bakken Shale. Management targets to grow system volumes to over 100,000bpd 
by 2013. This is supported by expansion at TSOs Mandan refinery (+10,000 bpd) and 
Anacortes refinery (+30,000bpd).  

The Bakken Shale play is one of the premier oil plays in North America today. This 
unconventional play extends from North Dakota and eastern Montana in the United States 
into the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Bakken Shale play in 
North Dakota is currently the most actively drilled oil play in the US. According to the Land 
Rig Newsletter, the current rig count is 143 (all time high was 157 in September 2011). Oil 
production was at 463,754 bpd, up from 342,876 bpd in January 2011 and 137,642 bpd in 
January 2008, according to the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC).

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O): The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute total return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the average total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the analyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculation and a 15% and a 
7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and 7.5% thresholds 
replace the +10-15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. 
**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, 
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward.  
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $33 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 
12.0%, distribution compounded annual growth rate of 8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth 
rate of 1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $33 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destruction and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report

constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or completeness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this report. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.

Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Q3 Takeaways 
 
     •    TLLP continues to assess drop-down opportunities   and plans to provide an update on its growth 
          initiatives during Tesoro Corp.s (TSO) Analyst an           d Investor Day on Decemb  er 5. In addition to 
          potential acquisitions, management is analyzing pote ntial investments to expand TLLPs footprint in 
          the Bakken and further enhance the utilization of its assets. Notably, our model reflects an assumed 
          $100MM drop-down in Q112 at an EBITDA multiple of 10x. 
 
     •    Crude oil trucking volumes should remain relatively level at approximately 24,000 Bbls/d until 2012. 
          Activity levels in the Bakken is expected to ramp up next year when TLLPs High Plains expansion 
          project is placed into service in Q212. Manageme  nt indicated that there ma y be an opportunity to 
          grow its trucking business as volumes on TLLPs system pick up. 
 
     •    TLLP continues its efforts to secure additional ou  tlet connections between the High Plains System 
          and third-party regional pipelines in the Bakken. The partnership could potentially provide additional 
          volumes to feed into the announced expansions of these pipelines. 
 
 
Q311 Results Ahead Of Expectations 
 
TLLP reported Q311 total EBITDA of $17.7MM, beating our estimate of $14.4MM, consensus of $15.3MM, and 
proforma Q211 results of $13.8MM. Th e variance from our forecast was primarily attributable to higher than 
expected revenues for both the crude oil gathering and terminalling segments and lower than anticipated 
operating expenses. DCF/unit was $0.56, which was also above our estimate of $0.42 due to Q3 operating 
results.  TLLP raised its distribution for the first time   since its IPO to $0.35 per  unit, which was earlier than 
anticipated and above our forecast of $0.34. Q3 distribution coverage was strong at 1.6x (or excess cash flow of 
$6.3MM). The partnership reported EPU of $0.49 versus our estimate of $0.37 and consensus of $0.44.

throughput increased 6% sequentially  as volumes recovered from weather related disruptions experienced in 
Q2 (i.e. from 78, 929 Bbls/d to 83,409 Bbls/d, compared  to our estimate of 80,710 Bbls/d). Average pipeline 
revenue per Bbl increased from $1.24 in Q211 to $1.35 in Q311 (vs. our estimate of $1.25), while trucking 
revenue per barrel increased from $2.86 in Q211 to $2.9  0 in Q311 (vs. our estimate of $2.95). The pipeline 
rate benefitted from a 7% increase (FERC PPI-based adjustment) effective 7/1/11.  
 
Terminalling. Transportation and Storage segment EB                                  ITDA was $11.5MM versus our forecast of $8.3MM. 
Segment operating and maintenance expense of $1.4MM was lower than our estimate of $3.5MM primarily 
due to the inclusion of a $2MM credit for the sale of                             product collected under TLLPs terminal loss allowance 
provision. Management anticipates operating expenses will increase sequentially in Q4 based on an anticipated 
$1MM decrease in the credit. The impact of higher than anticipated terminalling volumes of 144,997 Bbls/d 
(compared to our estimate of 134,579 Bbls/d) more than                                      offset slightly lower than forecasted short-haul 
pipeline throughput (i.e. 69,658 Bbls/d vs. our estimate of 71,395 Bbls/d). Notably,   terminalling volumes from 
third-parties (not TSO) increased sequentially by approximately 1,000 Bbls/d.  
 
TLLP Provides EBITDA Guidance And Project Update 
 
Management expects the partnership will generate                                   annualized EBITDA of $62MM ($15.5MM quarterly) 
excluding the anticipated benefit from announced growth   projects. This forecast was slightly higher than our 
previous Q4 estimate of $14.4MM and compares to our revised forecast of $15.6MM.

Outlook For 2012 
 
For 2012, we forecast TLLP will generate EBITDA of $75.4MM, which represents a 28% ($16MM) 
improvement over proforma 2011 results. The increase in our cash flow estimates is driven primarily by 
contributions from an assumed $100MM drop-down transaction in Q112. Our forecast also reflects the benefit

Raising 2011 DCF Estimate 
 
We are raising our 2011 DCF per unit estimate to $1.81   from $1.65 previously primar ily to reflect Q3 results. 
Our 2011 distribution per unit forecast increases to $1.39 from $1.36 based on the higher than anticipated rate 
declared for Q3. We are also raising our 2012 distribu                                   tion per unit estimate from $1.55 to $1.59, which 
represents a 14.8% year-over-year increase. There is no change to our 2012 DCF per unit estimate of $1.98.

Raising Valuation Range To $26-28 Per Unit 
 
We are raising our valuation range for TLLP by $1 per un                                      it to $26-28 to reflect a slightly higher five-year 
distribution CAGR forecast of 10.0% versus 9.6% previously. Our valuation range is based on: (1) a three-stage 
distribution discount model assuming a 9% required rate of return and a 1.25% long-term growth rate and (2) 
a price-to-distributable cash flow                     multiple of about 13x our 2012 esti                       mate. Risks to TLLP trading in our 
valuation range include: a slower-than-forecasted rate                                 of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic 
concentration.

Valuation
We derive our 12-month price target of $30 for TLLP using our multi-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our DDM is based
on our distribution estimates for the four quarters starting one year out followed by a 5-year growth rate of 8%, which, from the
current distribution implies a 5-year CAGR of 13.1%. Our long-term distribution schedule assumes that over the subsequent 11 years
growth converges to the 1% perpetual rate. We discount our distributions at a 9.0% discount rate, which incorporates our interest rate
expectations and a risk premium based on TLLP-specific risks and is consistent with an Average risk qualifier. Our $30 price target
implies a yield of 5.8% on our one year out annualized distribution of $1.72 per unit.

Price Target Impediment
Among the key issues that could impede our price target are:
 Acquisition risk;
 Damage to pipeline infrastructure;
 Commodity price risks;
 TLLP is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro
  would negatively impact results.
 Trading liquidity in the units is relatively low; and
 Other risks, including prolonged declines in volumes, interest rates, and regulatory risk.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies and Alaska with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trade Ideas

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure eligible
clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution may be
done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please contact
your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC  Capital
Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on its proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains market color and
commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the securities of subject companies discussed in this or other
research reports. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink: https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects
the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the security of a subject company in the coming days or weeks, based on
market  and  trading  events.  A  Short-Term  Trade  Idea  may  differ  from  the  price  targets  and/or  recommendations  in  our  published
research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of
the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that the security of a subject company that is
considered a long-term 'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary
selling pressure in the market; conversely, the security of a subject company that is rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered
susceptible to a short-term downward price correction. Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system,
and RBC Capital Markets generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas.
Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor
circumstances  and  objectives,  and  investors  should  make  their  own  independent  decisions  regarding  any  Short-Term  Trade  Ideas
discussed therein.

                                       High-return organic projects should drive double-digit distribution growth 
                                       TLLP has 7 projects totalling $29mm gross or   $20.5mm net (parent will reimburse TTLP 
                                       $8.5mm for Connolly gathering and Salt Lake City/Burley ethanol blending projects) and 
                                       expected to generate incremental EBITDA of $11.5mm, translating to a 1.8x multiple. Of the 
                                       7 projects, 3 are in the emerging Bakken.         The $6mm High Plains expansion will add 
                                       pumping, tankage and truck unloading capaci ty related to TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan, ND 
                                       refinery expansion. Expected EBITDA is $5mm and in-service date is 2Q12. The $1.5mm 
                                       Rangeland interconnect project will connect TLLP’s High Plains pipeline system to 
                                       Rangeland’s North Dakota terminal and pipeline. Expected EBITDA is $1.5mm and in-service 
                                       date is 2Q12. The $4mm Connolly gathering project will build a new gathering expected to 
                                       transport 1,500 bpd of crude. TSO will reimburse TLLP the $4mm cost. The project is 
                                       EBITDA neutral, as it replaces trucked         barrels with piped barrels. However, Connolly 
                                       provides TLLP with a new gathering hub for future expansions. Expected            in-service date is 
                                       1Q12. The remaining projects are terminal expansions in Los Angeles and Stockton, CA and 
                                       ethanol blending in Burley, ID (Salt Lake comple ted in 2Q11) with expected in-service dates 
                                       from 1Q12 to 4Q12.

                                       No update on first dropdown but we expect color at Dec analyst day 
                                       TLLP is in discussions with TSO regarding   the first asset dropdown. However, no further 
                                       color such as size or type of asset was prov  ided during the 11/8 earnings conference call. 
                                       We believe TLLP will provide more detail on it s dropdown schedule at the 12/5 analyst day 
                                       in New York. We forecast TLLP to do a $50mm dropdown in 1Q12.  

                                       Balance sheet update 
                                       At the end of 3Q, TLLP had $100mm of availability on its $150mm revolver. Debt/EBITDA 
                                       was below 1x. Given its low leverage, TLLP will li kely not raise equity for its current slate of

                                          3Q Review 

                                          3Q EBITDA $17.7mm was vs. our $14.2mm estimate and $14.3mm consensus. 
                                          Distributable cash flow was $17.2mm vs. our $12.6mm estimate. Upside to our estimates 
                                          was driven by higher-than-expected crude gathering and terminalling volumes, lower-than-
                                          expected maintenance capex and gain from pr  oduct sale under terminal loss allowance. 
                                          TLLP posted its first distribution bump s          ooner than we forecasted. The Partnership 
                                          increased its quarterly distribution 3.7%          QoQ to $0.35 per unit ($1.40 annualized). 
                                          Distribution coverage was a healthy 1.58x in 3Q. In addition, management slightly increased 
                                          its quarterly EBITDA run rate by $0.5mm to $15.5mm.

Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sector (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s          ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i              n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Investment Thesis

We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100% fee-based (low-risk) MLP with significant dropdown and
organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit  distribution  growth  CAGR  for  the  next  several  years  as  TLLP
expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that
provides  exposure  to  Bakken  formation  growth.  We  believe  the  Bakken  is  in  the  very  early  stages  of  development  and  that  TLLP
provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation

Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3-5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2016.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisition
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.

Buy  - anticipates  appreciation  of  10%  or  more  within  the  next  12  months,  and/or  a  total  return  of  10%  including  dividend  payments,
and/or the ability of the shares to perform better than the leading stock market averages or stocks within its particular industry sector.

Neutral - anticipates that the shares will trade at or near their current price and generally in line with the leading market averages due to
a perceived absence of strong dynamics that would cause volatility either to the upside or downside, and/or will perform less well than
higher  rated  companies  within  its  peer  group.  Our  readers  should  be  aware  that  when  a  rating  change  occurs  to  Neutral  from  Buy,
aggressive trading accounts might decide to liquidate their positions to employ the funds elsewhere.

Sell  - anticipates  that  the  shares  will  depreciate  10%  or  more  in  price  within  the  next  12  months,  due  to  fundamental  weakness
perceived in the company or for valuation reasons, or are expected to perform significantly worse than equities within the peer group.

                                          Crude Oil Gathering Segment
                                          Segment  income  of  $6.6  million  was  higher  than  our  estimate  of  $6.2  million.  Pipeline
                                          throughput of 59,530 barrels per day (bpd) was higher than our modeled number of 58,570
                                          bpd, while trucking volume of 23,879 was above our forecast of 23,500 bpd. Operating and
                                          maintenance expense and depreciation expense were below our estimates, while general and
                                          administrative expenses were above.

                                          Terminalling - Transportation & Storage Segment
                                          Segment income of $10.2 million was higher than our estimate of $6.8 million. Terminalling
                                          throughput of 144,997 bpd was well above our modeled number of 120,000 bpd, while short-
                                          haul pipeline throughput of 69,658 was above our forecast of 65,500 bpd. Operating and
                                          maintenance expense of $1.4 million was significantly lower than our estimate of $3.6 million
                                          and depreciation expense was below our estimate, while general and administrative expenses
                                          were above.
                                          The results benefited from a $2 million credit, which will be reduced to $1 million going
                                          forward. Volumes should be lower in the fourth quarter due to seasonality.

                                          Tesoro previously announced a distribution of $0.35/unit ($1.40/unit annualized) for the third
                                          quarter of 2011. The distribution represents a 4% increase over the pro rated $0.2448/unit for
                                          the second quarter 2011 distribution. The distribution was in line with our estimate.
                                          We are maintaining our distribution estimates at $0.9548/unit for 2011, $1.54/unit for 2012,
                                          and $1.70/unit for 2013. Our estimates provide a 10.4% growth rate in 2013. This compares
                                          quite favorably to the 5.7% estimated average growth in 2013 for liquids-based partnerships
                                          under our coverage. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $2.15/unit for 2012 and
                                          $2.30/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.4x for both years.

                                         We are raising our 2011 EBITDA estimate to $42.2 million from $38.9 million and our 2012
                                         EBITDA estimate to $72.8 million from $65.2 million. We are increasing our 2011 DCF
                                         estimate to $39.5 million from $34.8 million and our 2012 DCF estimate to $67.1 million from
                                         $58.4 million. Our higher estimates primarily reflect lower expenses, higher revenues, and
                                         lower cash interest expense.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $27.50 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of
   return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

Valuation/Risks
n  We have a Buy rating on TLLP and a $27.50 price target. Our price target is derived through a two-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate of
   return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

                                                              coverage ratios would be 1.2x for both years.

                                        Executive Summary 
                                         
                                        We are initiating coverage of Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) with a Buy rating and a 
 
                                        $27.50 price target. Tesoro Logistics is a crude oil and refined products Master 
 
                                        Limited  Partnership  (MLP)  that  gathers,  transports,  and  stores  crude  oil  and 
 
                                        distributes, transports, and stores refined products. The partnerships assets consist 
 
                                        of a crude oil gathering system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin area of North 
 
                                        Dakota  and  Montana,  eight  refined  products  terminals  in  the  Midwestern  and 

                                        Western United States, and a crude oil and refined products storage facility and 
                                        five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 
                                         
                                        Tesoros results are primarily driven by revenues generated from the gathering, 
                                        transporting, and storing of crude oil and refined products. The partnership does 
 
                                        not  generally  own  the  products  and  does  not  trade,  so  there  is  minimal  direct 
 
                                        commodity price exposure. The majority of its revenue is derived from Tesoro 
 
                                        Corporation under long-term, fee-based contracts that include minimum volume 
 
                                        commitments. 
 
                                         

                                        Tesoros growth should be driven by acquisitions and organic growth projects. 
                                        Growth spending should total approximately $18 million for 2011 and 2012. 
                                         
                                        As of December 31, 2010, the gross book value of the logistics assets that Tesoro 
                                        Corporation contributed to the partnership was approximately $193.0 million and 
 
                                        the gross book value of the company's retained logistics assets on which Tesoro 
 
                                        has a right of first offer was approximately $240.0 million.  
 
                                         
 
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
 
                                        $1.70/unit in 2013. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $1.87/unit for 

                                        2012 and $1.98/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.2x for both years. Our 
                                        estimates provide a 10.4% distribution growth rate in 2013.  
                                         
                                        Investment Thesis 
                                         
                                        We believe Tesoro is a good investment for several reasons, including: estimated 
                                        2013 distribution growth at 10.4%; our price target provides 18% upside from the 
                                        units current price; several avenues for growth, including dropdown acquisitions; 
                                        agreements with its parent that provide for minimum volume commitments; and it 
                                        should remain in the low distribution split levels over the near term. 
                                         
                                        We  believe  Tesoro  will  be  able  to  grow  its  operations  through  dropdown 
                                        acquisitions and benefit from Tesoro Corporations desire to expand its logistics 
                                        asset base. The partnership could also benefit from undertaking organic growth 
                                        projects and joint acquisitions with Tesoro Corporation. We believe Tesoro has 
                                        various opportunities for growth that should enable it to increase its distribution.

Tesoro Logistics LP                                                                                              October 13, 2011

                                         
                                        The majority of Tesoros revenue is derived from Tesoro Corporation under long-
                                        term, fee-based contracts that include minimum volume commitments. Under these 
                                        agreements, Tesoro will provide services to Tesoro Corporation and in turn will be 
                                        provided  with  minimum  monthly  throughput  volumes  of  crude  oil  and  refined 
                                        products.  Approximately  84%  of  Tesoros  revenue  is  derived  from  minimum 
                                        volume commitments.  
                                         
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
                                        $1.70/unit  in  2013.  Our  estimates  provide  a  10.4%  distribution  growth  rate  in 
                                        2013. This compares quite favorably to the 4.9% estimated average growth in 2013 
                                        for liquids-based partnerships under our coverage. 
                                         
                                        We do not forecast Tesoro entering the high distribution split levels until after 
                                        2015, given our current outlook for distribution increases. We view this as positive 
                                        for  the  partnership  as  it  facilitates  a  lower  cost  of  capital,  which  would  make 
                                        acquisitions  more  accretive,  all  things  being  equal.  If  Tesoro  were  to  make 
                                        acquisitions it would likely result in higher-than-forecasted distribution growth that 
                                        could push the distribution into the higher splits sooner.  
                                         
                                        Since Tesoros IPO in April, the units performance has led the liquids group. We 
                                        believe   the   outperformance   is   a   result   of   investors   anticipation   of   strong 
                                        distribution growth, which should lead to a solid total return. Although Tesoros 
                                        yield is lower than that of its peers, we believe the potential total return of Tesoro 
                                        makes for a compelling story.   
                                         
                                        Valuation Framework 
                                         
                                        We use a dividend (distribution) discount model to evaluate MLPs. We believe this 
                                        is the best approach as investors typically are drawn to the partnerships for the cash 
                                        flow. We use a two-stage model, estimating the partnerships distribution over the 
                                        next five years and then using a long-term growth rate. We then discount the cash 
                                        flows to derive the present value.  
                                         
                                        Our $27.50 price target for Tesoro is derived using a required rate of return of 
                                        8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91. 
                                        However,  since  the  model  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  assumptions  made  about 
                                        growth rates and discount rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis. We use 
                                        our forecast for distributions for the next five years, but use different required rates 
                                        of return and long-term growth rates to derive a series of values for Tesoros unit 
                                        price. We present our results in Figure 1.

                                              We estimate that Tesoros debt/EBITDA ratio will be 0.8x at year-end 2012, and it 

                                              should  remain  near  this  level  over  the  next  several  years.  EBITDA/interest  is 

                                              estimated at 25x at year-end 2012, and we forecast this ratio will increase over the 

                                              next  several  years.  The  partnership  only  has  $50  million  drawn  on  its  credit 

                                              facility,  resulting  in  the  strong  ratios.  As  Tesoro  undertakes  organic  capital 

                                              spending  and  potential  acquisitions,  the  partnership  is  likely  to  use  its  credit 

                                              facility as its first source of funding.  

                                               

                                              The partnership has a $150 million credit facility that expires in April 2014. Tesoro 

                                              can request that the maximum amount of the credit facility be increased up to $300 

                                              million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders.  

                                               

                                              The partnerships revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring Tesoro to 

                                              maintain a consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more 

                                              than 4.50 to 1.00 following acquisitions and not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 during 

                                              other times and an EBITDA to interest ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. The 

                                              partnerships target for leverage is a low 3x EBITDA multiple.  

                                               

                                              The  partnership  issued  guidance  for  expansion  capital  expenditures  of  $10.4 

                                              million for the 12 months ending March 2012, and maintenance capital of $4.6 

                                              million.  Since  the  original  guidance  was  issued,  Tesoro  has  announced  a  few 

                                              additional expansion projects. In our model, we forecast Tesoro will use its credit 

                                              facility to pay for its capital spending this year and next.

                                        Crude Oil Gathering 
                                         
                                        Tesoros  crude  oil  gathering  system  is  in  North  Dakota  and  Montana  and  is 
                                        referred to as the High Plains system. The system operates in the Williston Basin 
                                        and  includes  production  from  the  Bakken  Shale  region.  The  assets  include  an 
                                        approximate   23,000   barrels   per   day   (bpd)   truck-based   gathering   operation, 
                                        approximately  700  miles  of  pipeline,  and  storage  assets.  The  total  system  can 
                                        deliver up to 70,000 bpd to Tesoro Corporations Mandan refinery.  
                                         
                                        The  partnership and Tesoro  Corporation  have  a  10-year  pipeline transportation 
                                        services  agreement,  under  which  Tesoro  will  charge  Tesoro  Corporation  for 
                                        transporting crude oil on the High Plains pipeline system for shipments in North 
                                        Dakota. Tesoro Corporation will be obligated to transport an average of at least 
                                        49,000 bpd of crude oil per month at the committed rate.  
                                         
                                        Tesoro  also  expects  to  receive  revenue  from  shipments  above  the  minimum 
                                        volume  commitment  and  from  interstate  shipments.  Tesoro  Corporation  has 
                                        historically shipped volumes of crude oil in excess of the minimum throughput 
                                        commitment, and those excess shipments should continue. The partnership should 
                                        also derive revenue from other services.  
                                         
                                        The   partnership   and   Tesoro   Corporation   also   have   a   two-year   trucking 
                                        transportation  services  agreement  under  which Tesoro  will  provide  truck-based 
                                        crude oil gathering services to Tesoro Corporation. Under the agreement, Tesoro 
                                        Corporation will be obligated to pay a fee on a minimum volume of crude oil equal 
                                        to an average of 22,000 bpd per month.  
                                         
                                        Tesoro also expects to generate additional uncommitted transportation fees at the 
                                        same per-barrel rate for volumes in excess of Tesoro's minimum commitments. 
                                         
                                        Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage 
                                         
                                        Tesoro owns eight refined products terminals with total truck and barge delivery 
                                        capacity   of   approximately   229,000   bpd.   The   terminals   provide   distribution 
                                        primarily for refined products produced at Tesoro Corporation's refineries located 
                                        in Los Angeles and Martinez, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Kenai, Alaska; 
                                        Anacortes, Washington; and Mandan, North Dakota.  
                                         
                                        The partnership also owns a refined products and crude oil storage facility with 
                                        total shell capacity of approximately 878,000 barrels and three short-haul crude oil 
                                        supply pipelines and two short-haul refined product delivery pipelines connected to 
                                        third-party  interstate  pipelines.  These  assets  support  Tesoro  Corporations  Salt 
                                        Lake City refinery.

                                        Strategy 
                                                 
                                        Tesoro plans to pursue the following strategies:  
                                         
                                        •   Focus on Stable, Fee-Based Businesses. Tesoro will focus on providing fee-
                                            based  logistics  services  to  Tesoro  Corporation  and  third  parties  and  to

                                        •   Pursue Organic Growth Opportunities.  Tesoro will pursue expanding its asset 
                                            base   from   opportunities   that   may   arise   from   the   growth   of   Tesoro 
                                            Corporation's refining and marketing business or from increased third-party 
                                            activity.  These  opportunities  could  come  from  areas  that  complement  the 
                                            partnerships asset base or from new areas within its geographic footprint.

                                            acquisitions will be focused on logistics assets in the western half of the U.S.  
                                        •   Optimize Existing Asset Base and Pursue Third-Party Volumes . Tesoro will 
                                            pursue  opportunities  to  add  volumes,  improve  operating  efficiencies,  and

                                        roughly $10 million, and these should be finished by the second quarter of 2012.

                                                consisting of a dock with two vessel berths. 
                                                 
                                        The    partnership    could    pursue    third-party    acquisitions    under    the    right 
                                        circumstances, but we believe it is more likely that Tesoro will rely on organic 
                                        growth and dropdowns from its parent for growth.

                                        Distribution 
                                         
                                        We estimate Tesoros distribution at $0.9548/unit in 2011, $1.54/unit in 2012, and 
                                        $1.70/unit in 2013. Based on our distributable cash flow estimate of $1.87/unit for 
                                        2012 and $1.98/unit in 2013, coverage ratios would be 1.2x. Our estimates provide 
                                        a 10.4% growth rate in 2013. Management has stated that it is comfortable with a 
                                        coverage ratio of 1.1x.  
                                         
                                        We believe the partnership should be able to increase its distribution over the next 
                                        several years. Our estimates do not take into account any potential acquisitions and 
                                        reflects the partnerships guidance and CAPEX program for 2011 and 2012. As the 
                                        partnership continues with its growth program and if it were to make accretive 
                                        acquisitions, there should be room for further distribution growth.  
                                         
                                        Risks 
                                         
                                        The  partnership  and  all  MLPs  pass  through  taxes  to  unitholders,  giving  the 
                                        partnership  a  lower  cost  of  capital  relative  to  a  taxed  corporate  competitor. 
                                        Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest 
                                        risk to Tesoro and all MLPs.  
                                         
                                        The  partnership  is  dependent  on  volumes  running  through  its  infrastructure.  If 
                                        volumes   were   to   decline,   cash   flow   would   be   negatively   impacted.  The 
                                        transportation and processing of hydrocarbons are subject to environmental and 
                                        other regulations, and regulators  could  approve  more  stringent rules  that  could 
                                        increase the costs for companies in the energy industry.  
                                         
                                        The partnership is dependent on Tesoro Corporation for a substantially all of its 
                                        revenues.  Therefore,  if  Tesoro  Corporation  were  to  experience  a  significant 
                                        setback, the partnership could be negatively impacted. 
                                         
                                        One of the partnerships strategies is to acquire assets, with a focus on dropdowns 
                                        from its parent. If Tesoro Corporation does not sell midstream assets to Tesoro, the 
                                        partnership would be dependent on third-party acquisitions, which could be more 
                                        expensive and less accretive than dropdown assets.  
                                         
                                        A unitholder whose units are lent to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may 
                                        be viewed as having sold the units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping 
                                        their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short 
                                        seller should consider modifying any brokerage account agreements to prohibit 
                                        their  brokers  from  borrowing  their  units.  Because  of  the  nature  of  the  MLP 
                                        structure,  all  investors  should  consult  qualified  tax  counsel  before  making  an 
                                        investment in the sector.

                                        The  Williston  Basin  is  located  in  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Montana,  and 

                                        southern Canada. It extends approximately 475 miles from north to south and 300 

                                        miles from east to west. The basin became a major oil producer in the 1950s, when 

                                        large fields were discovered in North Dakota. Production peaked in 1986, but in 

                                        the early 2000s significant increases in production began because of horizontal 

                                        drilling techniques, especially in the Bakken Formation.

                                        In April 2008, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that the 

                                        Bakken  had  approximately  3.0-4.3  billion  barrels  of  technically  recoverable 

                                        reserves. The Bakken Formation estimate is larger than all other current USGS oil 

                                        assessments of the lower 48 states and is the largest continuous oil accumulation 

                                        ever assessed by the USGS. 

                                         

                                        According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority (NDPA), the rig count in North 

                                        Dakota has increased to 183 rigs as of July 2011 from 91 rigs as of December 

                                        2008. In addition, the NDPAs figures show that oil production from the Williston 

                                        has continued to increase over the last several years, with production averaging 

                                        414 thousand barrels per day (MBD) during the first quarter of 2011, compared 

                                        with 226 MBD during the first quarter of 2008.

   return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%. Our terminal value in 2016 is $30.91.
n  MLPs are tax-advantaged investments. Congress or the IRS could decide to remove these tax benefits. This is the biggest risk to all MLPs.

                                          New Bakken and Los Angeles organic growth projects added  
                                          TLLP announced 3 new additional projects              totalling $8MM with expected incremental 
                                          EBITDA of $2MM. In total, TLLP’s organic growth budget is $28MM, expected to generate 
                                          $11MM of EBITDA or an attractive 2.5x multiple . Of the 3 new projects, 2 are in the Bakken. 
                                          The $3MM Rangeland interconnect project will co nnect TLLP’s High Plains pipeline system 
                                          to Rangeland’s North Dakota terminal and pipe line. Expected in-service date is 2Q12. The 
                                          second Bakken project is the $5MM Connelly gathering hub, which will build a new 
                                          gathering hub to support future crude gathering  expansions. The initial pipeline is expected 
                                          to transport 1,500 bpd of crude by 2Q12, replacing some volumes currently trucked. The 
                                          third new project is expanding the LA terminal  capacity by 5,000 bpd. The project has no 
                                          cost as it only requires a permit. Expected EBITDA is $1MM and in-service date is 1Q12.

                                          First dropdown slated for 4Q11/1Q12, sooner than we expected 
                                          Management announced that the first dropdown should be announced “in the coming 
                                          months.” While no further color was provided, such   as size or type of asset, we view the 
                                          news favorably as providing visibility on growth via drops. We are changing our estimate for 
                                          a 2013 drop to a 1Q12 dropdown at $50MM. Given TLLP’s low leverage, $100MM of 
                                          availability on its revolver and reasonably high  coverage, we believe it is likely no equity will 
                                          need to be raised, assuming the transaction is approximately $50MM.

Primary Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price) 
Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 12-Aug-2011, USD 24.20), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sector (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s    ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i        n an advisory
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. 
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "sector coverage universe":

Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Takeaways From Earnings Call 
 
     •    Management expects to have an offer for a drop-down in the upcoming months but did not provide 
          details on the exact timing or size of the potentia      l acquisition. To note, our model incorporates an 
          assumed $100MM transaction in Q112.  
 
     •    Tesoro Corp. (TSO) announced plans to increase Ba kken crude shipments to its Washington refinery 
          (30,000 Bbls/d) and will invest $50MM to buil                d related loading and        unloading facilities. 
          Management noted that the asset (once completed   in late 2012) could potentially be a drop-down 
          candidate for the MLP. 
 
     •    Management anticipates quarterly EBITDA to appr oximate $14-15MM, which reflects the benefit of 
          the recently installed Salt Lake City ethanol projec  t, tariff increases as of  7/1, and new terminalling 
          volumes from TSO. This implies  a $5MM improvement on an annualized basis based on TLLPs S-1 
          guidance of $53MM for TTM 3/31/12. 
 
     •    Crude oil pipeline volumes have  recovered to approximately 60,000  Bbls/d, as most of the weather-
          related issues in the Bakken have been resolved. 
 
Off To A Strong Start With Q2 Results Ahead Of Expectations 
 
For the period beginning 4/26/11 (completion of IPO) and ending 6/30/11, TLLP reported EBITDA of 
$10.0MM, net income of $7.9MM, an  d available cash flow of $9.7MM. Adjusting these balances for a full 
quarter, this equates to EBITDA of   $13.8MM, $10.9MM, and $13.4MM,   respectively, which all exceed our 
estimates for Q2. Specifically, adjusted DCF/unit of $0  .43 was above our forecast of $0.35 primarily due to 
stronger than anticipated terminalling results, lower cash interest expense of $0.5MM, and lower maintenance 
capex of $1MM. For Q2, TLLP plans to pay a prorated  distribution/unit of $0.2448, which equates to a MQD 
of $0.3375 and an annualized distribution/unit of $1.3         5. The partnerships distribution coverage ratio was 
solid at 1.3x.

Crude oil pipeline and trucking volumes appear to be tracking in line with expectations despite weather-related 
disruptions in the Bakken during Q2 (i.e. 55,717 Bbls/d vs. our estimate of 56,352 Bbls/d and 23,212 Bbls/d vs. 
our estimate of 22,780 Bbls/d). However, terminalling  and short-haul pipeline thro ughput of 134,579 Bbls/d 
and 71,395 Bbls/d, respectively, were well ahead of our forecasts of 118,253 Bbls/d and 63,583 Bbls/d. Notably, 
management indicated that TLLP benefitted from a ~10,000 Bbls/d increase in terminalling throughput due to 
new TSO volumes. Additionally, short-ha ul pipeline volumes in Q2 benefitted from higher run rates at TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. 
 
Adds To Slate Of Growth Projects 
 
TLLP plans to invest $28MM ($23MM net of reimbursements from TSO) over the next twelve months to 
expand its crude oil gathering system and terminalling assets. The projects are expected to generate annualized 
EBITDA of approximately $11MM, which implies an                   average EBITDA multiple of 2.1x. Management 
announced three new projects (not included in the S-1): 
 
     1)   Rangeland Interconnect : TLLP plans to spend $3MM to connect its High Plains System to 
          Rangeland Energys crude oil loading terminal and pipeline facility. The project is expected to be in 
          service in Q212 and generate EBITDA of $1MM. 
      
     2)   Connelly Gathering Hub: The partnership will invest $5MM, which will be reimbursed by TSO, to 
          build a new gathering hub and rela  ted tankage and metering on its High Plains System by Q212. 
          Initially, 1,500 Bbls/d of crude oil will be dive           rted to the pipeline from trucking volumes. 
          Consequently, TLLP does not anticipate incremental EBITDA related to the project. However, the 
          investment should facilitate the partnerships ability to expand nearby gathering lines in the future. 
 
     3)   LA Terminal Permit Expansion : Currently, TLLPs Los Angeles   terminal is fully utilized. The 
          partnership plans to increase capacity by 5,000 Bbls /d. The project should be  in service by Q112 and 
          generate incremental EBITDA of $1MM.

Outlook For 2012 
 
For 2012, we forecast EBITDA of $74.5MM, which re presents a 36% ($20MM) improvement over 2011. The 
increase in our cash flow estimates  is driven primarily by estimated cont ributions from $10MM of forecasted 
growth capex in 2011 and partial contributions fr             om an assumed $29MM of growth capex in 2012. 
Additionally, our model incorporates a $100MM drop-d               own assumption in Q112 to be completed at an 
EBITDA multiple of 10x. In 2012, we forecast TLLP will increase its distribution by 14.0% to $1.55 per unit and 
generate a distribution coverage ratio of 1.2x.

Raising Our 2011-12 Estimates 
 
We are raising our 2011 and 2012 DCF/unit estimates to   $1.65 and $1.90, respectively, from $1.46 and $1.71 
primarily to reflect Q2 results, a                       higher run rate for TLLPs base earnings from terminalling, and the 
anticipated benefit from recently an  nounced organic growth projects. We   are also increasing our 2011 and 
2012 distribution/unit estimates slightly to $1.36 and $1 .55, respectively, from our previous estimates of $1.35 
and $1.52. Assuming a long-term distri  bution coverage ratio of 1.1x (TLLPs target), our 5-year distribution 
CAGR forecast increases slightly to 9.6% from 9.1%.

No Change To Valuation Range Of $26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on (1) our three-stage distribution discount model, which assumes a required rate 
of return of 8.5% and a long-term growth rate of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow multiple of 
13.5x our 2012 estimate. Risks to the units trading below our valuation ra nge include a slower-than-forecasted 
rate of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic concentration.

Valuation
Using our multi-stage dividend discount model (DDM) for the LP units, we calculate a 12-month price target of $29/unit, which
implies a yield of 5.7% on our one-year-out distribution estimate of $1.67/unit. Our DDM is based on our distribution estimates for the
four quarters starting one year out and then a five-year growth rate of 9% (from the current distribution rate, these assumptions result
in an annualized growth rate of 14% over the next five years). We discount our DDM distributions at a rate consistent with our interest
rate expectations and the risk associated with an Average risk qualifier. Our risk qualifier considers and weighs various risk factors,
including TLLP's trading liquidity, debt to forward EBITDA of 0.9x, forward total unit coverage of 1.2x, diversification, and
commodity exposure.

Price Target Impediment
Among the key issues that could impede our price target are:
 Acquisition risk;
 Damage to pipeline infrastructure;
 Commodity price risks;
 TLLP is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro
  would negatively impact results.
 Trading liquidity in the units is relatively low; and
 Other risks, including prolonged declines in volumes, interest rates, and regulatory risk.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies and Alaska with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity Rating System
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned to
a particular stock represents solely the analyst's view of how that stock will perform over the next 12 months relative to the analyst's
sector average.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents best in Outperform category; analyst's best ideas; expected to significantly outperform the sector over 12
months; provides best risk-reward ratio; approximately 10% of analyst's recommendations.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Qualifiers (any of the following criteria may be present):
Average  Risk  (Avg): Volatility  and  risk  expected  to  be  comparable  to  sector;  average  revenue  and  earnings  predictability;  no
significant cash flow/financing concerns over coming 12-24 months; fairly liquid.
Above Average Risk (AA): Volatility and risk expected to be above sector; below average revenue and earnings predictability; may
not be suitable for a significant class of individual equity investors; may have negative cash flow; low market cap or float.
Speculative (Spec): Risk consistent with venture capital; low public float; potential balance sheet concerns; risk of being delisted.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy

RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.

Investment Thesis 

TLLP is a fee-based, growth  oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to own, operate and 
acquire crude oil and refined products logistic s assets. In other words, TLLP was formed 
to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its logistics infrastructure business. Initially, 
substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under various 
long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume commitments. 
Near term, there is visible growth from already identified projects and future drop-downs or 
asset sales from Tesoro Corp. Longer term, we expect that TLLPs third party business will 
grow both organically and via acquisitions.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.7 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 51% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights. 

Additional Color 

■   Ethanol project completed:  In 2Q11 TLLP completed the Salt Lake City Terminal 
    Ethanol project which is projected to provide $1mm of annual EBITDA. 

■   High Plains Pipeline System expansion:  TLLP will be spending $5mm to build a 
    gathering hub and initial gathering pipeline at Connelly, North Dakota that would 
    receive crude oil by pipeline which is currently  received by truck. Tesoro will reimburse 
    the initial project cost and there will be no expected near term  earnings impact to 
    TLLP. However, it does position the partnership for future growth. 

■   Existing Projects Update:  The partnership expects to spend around $18mm or 
    $17mm net of reimbursement from Tesoro on the projects announced earlier that are 
    projected to be completed in 2012. These projects are expected to provide $8mm 
    additional EBITDA annually. 

■   Segment Growth Projects:  

    o    Crude Oil Gathering  TLLP expects to spend around $13mm on expansion 
        projects which will provide around $6 mm of additional EBITDA annually. These 
        projects are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. 

    o    Terminalling, Transportation and Stor age  TLLP expects to spend around 
        $12mm on expansion projects which wi      ll provide around $4mm of additional 
        EBITDA annually. These projects are expected to be completed in the first quarter 
        of 2012.

■   Potential Dropdowns from Tesoro Provide Visible Growth Opportunities.  Tesoro 
     still has logistics assets with total aggr  egate book value of $240 million that may be 
     sold to TLLP. This compares to approximately $193 million for the initial assets 
     contributed to TLLP. Furthermore, Tesoro announced a project to deliver 30,000 bpd 
     of Bakken crude oil to its Anacortes refinery via rail on 7/15/2011. Tesoro will build an 
     unloading facility to accommodate the unit trai                 n. Once completed, Tesoro plans to 
     offer the facility to TLLP.

■   Raising Estimates.    We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $28.8mm (from 
     $26.2mm) and $70.5mm (from $58.8mm) in 2H11 and FY2012, respectively. DCF is 
     forecast at $25.8mm (from $23.2mm) and $61mm (from $50.4mm) in 2H11 and 
     FY2012, respectively. The revisions reflect a higher run-rate exiting 2Q11 and positive 
     impact from growth capital expenditures. 

■   DCF coverage ratio expected to be high.     We expect   TLLPs coverage ratio to 
     remain high at around 1.3x in FY2012. A hi gher coverage ratio gives TLLP the ability 
     to fund its dropdowns to a certain extent without accessing the capital markets and 
     gives it flexibility to grow its distributions in the future. 

■   Liquidity: At the end of 2Q TLLP had approximately $110mm of liquidity, consisting of 
     $10mm of cash and $100mm available under its credit facility.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O):  The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relev ant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29  th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian  ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative  attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals t  he less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investm  ent opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute to  tal return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions   and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ra tings are based on a stocks total return relative to the a verage total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the an  alyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks, 12-month rolling yield is incorporated in the absolute total return calculat  ion and a 15% and a 
7.5% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock rating definitions, respectively. The 15% and   7.5% thresholds 
replace the +10-15% and -10-15% levels in the Neutral stock rating definition, respectively. 
**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Cr edit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulatio  ns preclude certain types of communications,  
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward. 
 
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $29 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, 
distribution compounded annual growth rate of  8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a termin  al growth rate of 
1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $29 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon  TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at   the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destructio n and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

This report is not directed to, or intended for distribution to or use by, any person or entity who is a citizen or resident of or located in any locality, state, country or other jurisdiction 
where such distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Credit Suisse AG, the Swiss bank, or its subsidiaries or its affiliates 
(CS) to any registration or licensing requirement within such jurisdiction. All material presented in this report, unless specifically indicated otherwise, is under copyright to CS. None of

The information, tools and material presented in this report are provided to you for information purposes only and are not to be used or considered as an offer or the solicitation of an 
offer to sell or to buy or subscribe for securities or other financial instruments. CS may not have taken any steps to ensure that the securities referred to in this report are suitable for 
any particular investor. CS will not treat recipients as its customers by virtue of their receiving the report. The investments or services contained or referred to in this report may not be 
suitable for you and it is recommended that you consult an independent investment advisor if you are in doubt about such investments or investment services. Nothing in this report 
constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice or a representation that any investment or strategy is suitable or appr opriate to your individual circumstances or otherwise 
constitutes a personal recommendation to you. CS does not offer advice on the tax consequences of investment and you are advised to contact an independent tax adviser. Please 
note in particular that the bases and levels of taxation may change. 
CS believes the information and opinions in the Disclosure Appendix of this report are accurate and complete. Information and opinions presented in the other sections of the report 
were obtained or derived from sources CS believes are reliable, but CS makes no representations as to their accuracy or complet  eness. Additional information is available upon 
request. CS accepts no liability for loss arising from the use of the material presented in this report, except that this exclusion of liability does not apply to the extent that liability arises 
under specific statutes or regulations applicable to CS. This report is not to be relied upon in substitution for the exercise of independent judgment. CS may have issued, and may in 
the future issue, a trading call regarding this security. Trading calls are short term trading opportunities based on market events and catalysts, while stock ratings reflect investment 
recommendations based on expected total return over a 12-month period as defined in the disclosure section. Because trading calls and stock ratings reflect different assumptions and 
analytical methods, trading calls may differ directionally from the stock rating. In addition, CS may have issued, and may in the future issue, other reports that are inconsistent with, and 
reach different conclusions from, the information presented in this report. Those reports reflect the different assumptions, views and analytical methods of the analysts who prepared 
them and CS is under no obligation to ensure that such other reports are brought to the attention of any recipient of this repo  rt. CS is involved in many businesses that relate to 
companies mentioned in this report. These businesses include specialized trading, risk arbitrage, market making, and other proprietary trading. 
Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, ex        press or implied, is made regarding future 
performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophis ticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.

Investment Thesis

TLLP is currently our top pick within our MLP coverage. We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100%
fee-based  (low-risk)  MLP  with  significant  dropdown  and  organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit
distribution growth CAGR for the next several years as TLLP expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large
crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that provides exposure to Bakken formation growth. We believe the Bakken is
in the very early stages of development and that TLLP provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation

Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3-5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisition
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.

Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Rating System prior to January 14th, 2008:

Buy  - anticipates  appreciation  of  10%  or  more  within  the  next  12  months,  and/or  a  total  return  of  10%  including  dividend  payments,
and/or the ability of the shares to perform better than the leading stock market averages or stocks within its particular industry sector.

Neutral - anticipates that the shares will trade at or near their current price and generally in line with the leading market averages due to
a perceived absence of strong dynamics that would cause volatility either to the upside or downside, and/or will perform less well than
higher  rated  companies  within  its  peer  group.  Our  readers  should  be  aware  that  when  a  rating  change  occurs  to  Neutral  from  Buy,
aggressive trading accounts might decide to liquidate their positions to employ the funds elsewhere.

Sell  - anticipates  that  the  shares  will  depreciate  10%  or  more  in  price  within  the  next  12  months,  due  to  fundamental  weakness
perceived in the company or for valuation reasons, or are expected to perform significantly worse than equities within the peer group.

Investment Thesis

TLLP is currently our top pick within our MLP coverage. We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100%
fee-based  (low-risk)  MLP  with  significant  dropdown  and  organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit
distribution growth CAGR for the next several years as TLLP expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large
crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that provides exposure to Bakken formation growth. We believe the Bakken is
in the very early stages of development and that TLLP provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation

Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3-5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisitions
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.

                                       Investment Thesis 

                                       TLLP is a crude oil/refined products pipe       line and storage MLP with visible growth 
                                       prospects, a relatively low risk profile and strategically located assets. The Partnership offers 
                                       an attractive total return value proposition    of 15.5%, comprised of a 5.5% yield (as of 
                                       6/7/11) and 10% expected distribution growth (our 3-year CAGR forecast). Upside 
                                       potential to our growth estimates could come from more immediate asset drop downs from 
                                       parent Tesoro (TSO, $21.88, 2-Equal Weight/3-Negative by Barclays Capital U.S. 
                                       Independent Refiners analyst Paul Cheng). We take a conservative approach and assume no 
                                       drops in 2011 or 2012 and only a $100MM drop in 2013. Long-term distribution growth 
                                       prospects are supported by additional organi c expansion projects in the emerging Bakken 
                                       Shale, including pipeline interconnects to      transport third-party crude oil volumes as 
                                       production in the region is expected to double  over the next five years. TLLP was spun off 
                                       from independent refiner TSO to unlock the        value and provide a growth vehicle for the 
                                       midstream business. TLLP offers an opportunity  for investors to get into the early stages of 
                                       a developing growth partnership  in the relatively stable crude oil/refined products pipeline 
                                       subsector. 

                                       Visible growth prospects 
We believe TLLP is well                An expansive opportunity set to grow the dist      ribution is supported  by organic projects, 
positioned to post 10%                 asset drop downs from the GP, potential thir      d-party acquisitions and increased capacity 
distribution growth (3-year            utilization from being a standalone midstream en  tity (vs. primarily a cost center within a 
CAGR), supported by organic            refiner). It is important to hi ghlight that modest-scale expansion capex is capable of driving 
growth projects, including the         solid accretion given TLLP’s relatively small distributable cash flow base ($46MM) and low 
emerging Bakken Shale, and             cost of capital (approximately 6%). Near term, TLLP has ample financial flexibility with 
asset drop downs.                      $100MM of borrowing availability on its $150MM revolver, enabling financing of initial 
                                       expansion capex without having to raise equity, which drives accretion. 

                                       We believe TLLP is well positioned to post 10% distribution growth (3-year CAGR), 
                                       supported by organic growth projects, including the emerging Bakken Shale and asset drop 
                                       downs. Near-term growth is visible with five small but high-return organic projects (High

                                    Organic Projects 
                                    Over the next 12 months, TLLP is expected to   complete five projects with a total cost of 
                                    $15.5MM and expected EBITDA of $10.5MM or a very attractive 1.5x multiple. The existing 
                                    organic projects would generate EBITDA growth of 18% vs. LTM 1Q12.  

                                    High Plains (Bakken) crude gath ering expansion.  Of the existi ng five organic projects, the 
                                    Bakken expansion is expected to generate the most cash flow at $6MM or approximately 
                                    60% of the $10.5MM of EBITDA from the projec ts. The $6.6MM High Plains expansion will 
                                    add pumping, tankage and truck unloading capa city related to TSO’s 10,000 bpd Mandan, 
                                    ND refinery expansion.  

                                    In terms of TLLP’s other current projects, the  Burley, ID and Salt Lake City, UT terminals will 
                                    add ethanol blending. Total project cost is  $2.4MM with expected EBITDA of $1.5MM. At 
                                    the Stockton, CA terminal, TLLP will add 8,000 bpd of storage capacity to gain more of 
                                    TSO’s throughput volumes. The $4.5MM projec       t is expected to generate EBITDA of 
                                    $2.6MM.  At its Los Angeles, CA terminal, TLLP  will add transmix transportation capability 
                                    to serve TSO’s Los Angeles refinery. The $2MM pr oject is expected to generate EBITDA of 
                                    $0.4MM.   

                                    Acquisitions 
                                    We believe another leg of TLLP’s growth stool is asset drop down opportunities from parent 
                                    TSO. TLLP has right of first offer on TSO’s midstream assets for 10 years. While timing of 
                                    drop downs is uncertain, we estimate the probability of drop downs is high given TSO’s 
                                    incentive to maximize shareholder value by se lling midstream assets to the tax-advantaged 
                                    MLP while also receiving distributions as the  owner of the general partner and 50% of the 
                                    limited partner units.  

                                    In terms of the size of the drop down opportunity set, TLLP has not provided a market value 
                                    or EBITDA estimate. While a blunt instrument,  the book value estimate of midstream assets 
                                    at TSO is $240MM vs. $193MM book value of a ssets currently in TLLP. On a rough basis, 
                                    we estimate market value of potential   dropdowns at $500MM and EBITDA of $50MM-
                                    $63MM (assuming 8-10x multiple), roughly double TLLP’s expect forward 12-month 
                                    EBITDA. 

                                    We conservatively estimate TLLP dropdown schedule at $0 in 2011, $0 in $2012, $100MM 
                                    in 2013, $125MM in 2014 and $150MM in 2015. However, we would not be surprised if a 
                                    drop to TLLP occurred in 2012 or even late 2011.

                                        While third-party acquisitions are also a possibi lity for TLLP, we expect the Partnership to 
                                        focus on organic projects and drop downs over  the next few years, as that opportunity set 
                                        supports 10% plus distribution CAGR.  

                                        Potential for increased capacity utilization 
                                        As a standalone midstream company, TLLP has             potential to increase asset utilization by 
                                        increasing TSO and third-party volumes on its  crude oil gathering and terminalling assets. 
                                        For example, TLLP could add third-party volumes on its High Plains crude gathering system 
                                        in the Bakken. In addition,      the Partnership has room to increase TSO volumes at its 
                                        California and Washington state refined prod        ucts terminals and third-party volumes at 
                                        other terminals. 

                                        Relatively low risk profile 
Approximately 84% of TLLP               TLLP has a relatively low risk profile due its st  able, fee-based cash flow stream backed by 
revenues are backed by                  long-term minimum volume commitments from TSO. Approximately 84% of TLLP revenues 
minimum pipeline and storage            are backed by minimum pipeline and storage volume commitments from TSO. Stability is 
volume commitments from TSO.            underpinned by 10-year contracts (except trucking with 2 years) that provide minimal direct 
                                        commodity price exposure (nearly 100% fee-based revenue) and inflation protection (fees 
                                        adjusted by PPI, CPI). The High Plains truck gathering contracts was set at 2 years to benefit 
                                        from expected higher rates due to a ramp in Bakken crude production.

                                    Reasonable business mix and geographic diversification for a young partnership 
                                    While TLLP currently lacks customer mix diversification, with TSO comprising 
                                    approximately 95% of revenues, TLLP does ha       ve asset and geographic diversification. 
                                    TLLP’s five business lines comprise a divers ified revenue mix -- Terminalling 35%, Pipeline 
                                    Gathering 28%, Truck Gathering 25%, Short-Haul Pipeline Transportation 6% and Storage 
                                    6% of sales. On geographic footprint, TLLP   assets are integrated with TLLP refining and 
                                    marketing activities. TLLP assets are locate  d in seven states -- North Dakota, Montana, 
                                    California, Idaho, Utah, Washington, and Alaska.  

                                    Low financial leverage 
                                    TLLP has low leverage with Debt/EBITDA of 1x. In addition, the Partnership has $100MM of 
                                    borrowing availability on its $150MM revolver, which is more than adequate to fund 
                                    $10MM of current organic growth projects over the next 12 months and a potential drop 
                                    down. The Partnership borrowed $50MM under the  revolver at the close of IPO to fund a 
                                    cash distribution to TSO (in addition to     $280MM of IPO proceeds) to pay for the 
                                    contributed assets and capex. The $150MM revolver is expandable to $300MM, matures

TLLP’s High Plains system is        TLLP’s asset base is well positioned in bo  th the emerging Bakken Shale (North Dakota, 
strategically located not only      Montana) and western US. We believe the Partnership’s key asset is its Bakken (High Plains) 
because of its footprint in the     crude oil gathering system. The Bakken is a prolific region poised for continued strong 
emerging Bakken but also as the     production growth due to an 83% YoY increase in proved crude oil reserves to 1.058 billion

                                        Research Associates forecast). TLLP’s High Pl ains system is strategically located not only 
                                        because of its footprint in the emerging Bakken  but also as the only crude oil supply source

                                        volume growth is also supported by the Mandan refinery’s 10,000 bpd expansion to 68,000 
                                        bpd by 2Q12. In addition, the High Plains sy        stem has growth opportunities from adding 
                                        third-party volumes through pipeline interconnects.

                                        Other potential growth opportunities in the Ba kken include increasing High Plains pipeline 
                                        volumes by adding pumping capacity or building new gathering lines and building a rail 
                                        facility at the Mandan refinery to transport crude (beyond Mandan’s 68,000 bpd capacity in 
                                        2Q12) markets outside ND. In the Western US, TLLP’s terminals and pipelines benefit from 
                                        integration with TSO’s refining and marketin  g operations and more stringent regulatory 
                                        climate (California, Washington) that acts as a potential barrier to entry from competitors.

valuation vs. MLP peers due to 
its visible growth prospects,          TLLP offers (as of 6/7/11 close) an attrac        tive total return value proposition of 15.5%, 
Bakken exposure, asset drop            comprised of 5.5% yield and 10.0% growth (3  -year CAGR forecast), which is above peer 
down potential, low cost of            average total return of 11.5% and our MLP coverage universe of 12              .0%. Because of its 
capital and high cash flow             higher expected growth rate, nearly double peer average, TLLP trades at a premium to peers 
stability.                             on both a yield and EV/Adjusted EBITDA basis.  In terms of yield, TLLP trades a 5.5% yield 
                                       vs. peer yield of 6.2% and our MLP coverage          universe of 6.6%. On EV/Adjusted EBITDA 
                                        (2011e/2012e) basis, TLLP trades at 16.9x/14.4x vs. 14.4x/12.8x peers and 13.1x/11.5x 
                                        MLP universe. In terms of distribution covera  ge, TLLP is in line with peers at 1.1x. Our 
                                        coverage universe coverage is a little higher      at 1.2x due to commodity-exposed names 
                                        needing to keep higher coverage due to hi            gher cash flow volatility vs. fee-based 
                                        crude/refined product names. 

                                        We believe that TLLP deserves a premium valu ation vs. MLP peers due to its visible growth 
                                        prospects, Bakken exposure, asset drop down po tential, low cost of capital and high cash 
                                        flow stability. In addition, TLLP offers exposure to the early stages of a developing growth 
                                        partnership in the relatively stable crude oil/refined products pipeline subsector.

                                    is 18.8% vs. 15.3% peer average. Our distribution estimate and yiel  d are predicated on a 
                                    10% distribution growth CAGR driven primarily by organic projects and an asset drop down 
                                    in 2013. 

                                    Upside case $32 valuation 
                                    In an upside scenario, we believe TLLP could  exceed our distribution  growth estimate with 
                                    an asset drop down or third-party acquisit   ion within the next 12 months. Assuming a 
                                    $100MM transaction at an 8x multiple would imply a 12-month price target of $32 per unit. 
                                    The $32 valuation would be based on a 12-month forward distribution estimate of $1.58 
                                    (up from $1.48) and target yield of 5% (mod est compression from 5.3%) due to accretion 
                                    from a $100MM acquisition at 8x multiple. 

                                    Downside case $23 valuation 
                                    In a downside scenario, we estimate a 12-month price target of $23 per unit. Downside 
                                    potential could come from a higher target yi  eld, due to the market demanding a higher 
                                    equity risk premium due to macro conditions  and/or TLLP not achieving expected returns 
                                    on current growth projects. A $23 valuation could be based on a 12-month distribution 
                                    estimate of $1.38 (down from $1.48) and a target yield of 6% (expansion from 5.3%). 

                                    Tax Deferral 
                                    TLLP’s distribution is approximately 80% tax  deferred. That means of the current $1.35 per 
                                    unit distribution, a unitholde  r would pay ordinary income taxes on $0.27 (20% of 
                                    distribution), with the remaining $1.08 (80% of distribution) reducing a unitholder’s basis. 
                                    The 80% tax deferral level is in line with th e MLP sector and represents an important 
                                    component of the value proposition.

                                   Tesoro Logistics Overview 

                                   Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) is a crude oil/   refined product pipeline and storage MLP, 
                                   headquartered in San Antonio, that was spun-o ff from independent refiner Tesoro (TSO) in 
                                   April 20, 2011 IPO. In the transaction, 14.95MM units were issued at $21 per unit (with a 
                                   6.4% yield). TLLP was created to facilitate   the growth of TSO’s midstream business and 
                                   unlock value through the tax-advantaged MLP st ructure. TSO owns a 52% interest in TLLP, 
                                   comprised of a 50% LP and 2% GP interest. TSO owns 15.255MM subordinated units, 
                                   304,890 common units and 622,649 general partner units. The public owns a 48% LP stake, 
                                   with 14.95MM common units. TLLP midstream assets are integrated with TSO’s refining 
                                   and marketing business. The Partnership’s asse ts are comprised of a crude oil gathering 
                                   system in the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in  ND and MT, 8 refined products terminals in 
                                   the midwest and western US and a crude oil/re  fined products storage facility and short-
                                   haul pipelines in Utah. TLLP has two op      erating segments, crude oil gathering and 
                                   terminalling, transportation, storage. Re venue mix is 53% crude oil gathering/47% 
                                   terminalling, transportation, storage. TLLP  has long-term take-or-pay contracts with TSO 
                                   for minimum volume commitments in both se gments, comprising 84% of total revenues. 
                                   The remaining 16% of revenues is from TSO  volumes beyond the minimum level and third 
                                   party volumes.

                                    Crude Oil Gathering  
                                    The Crude Oil Gathering segment accounts fo      r approximately 53% of our estimate for 
                                    TLLP’s 2011 EBITDA. The segment’s asset is th  e High Plains system, which gathers and 
                                    transports crude produced in the emerging  Bakken Shale (North Dakota and Montana) to 
                                    TSO's Mandan, ND refinery. The High Plains  system is comprised of a 700-mile, 70,000 bpd 
                                    capacity pipeline system (plus related storage) and 23,000 bpd of truck-based crude 
                                    gathering. Currently, the only destination   point for the High Plains pipeline and truck 
                                    volumes is TSO’s Mandan refinery. However, TLLP  is exploring ways to diversify its revenue 
                                    stream by adding third party shippers and interconnects with non-TSO pipes. There are five 
                                    potential pipeline interconnects – Enbridge pipe  at Portal and Ramburg, ND, Little Missouri 
                                    pipe at Fryburg, ND, Belle Fourche pipe at Frit z, ND, Bridger pipe at Richey, MT. Integration 
                                    with the Mandan refinery is a positive for TLLP, as TSO is currently in the process of 
                                    expanding refining capacity by 10,000 bpd to 68,000 bpd by 2Q12, which provides visible 
                                    growth for the High Plains system. 

                                    Crude Oil Gathering segment revenue mix is 53% pipelines and 47% truck gathering. 
                                    Approximately 81% of segment revenue is        derived from contracted minimum volume 
                                    commitments with the parent. TSO’s required minimum crude oil volumes of 49,000 bpd on 
                                    the High Plains pipeline and 22,000 bpd on trucks represent 84% and 96% of pipe and truck 
                                    volumes, respectively. In terms of volume gr    owth, pipeline throughput is expected to 
                                    increase 14% (from 2010 average to LTM 1Q12) to 58,000 bpd. Trucking volumes are 
                                    expected to remain relatively flat. Importantly,  High Plains pipeline  and trucking fees have 
                                    inflation protection. Pipeline tariffs are adju sted annually by the FERC PPI+2.65% inflation 
                                    escalator (which will total 7% starting July 1) and the trucking rates are adjusted by the CPI.

                                    Terminalling/Transportation/Storage 
                                    The segment accounts for approximately 47%   of our estimate for TLLP’s 2011 EBITDA. 
                                    Assets include eight refined products terminal s in the midwest and western US, five short-
                                    haul Utah intrastate pipelines and a crude oil/ refined products storage facility. The eight RP 
                                    terminals have truck and barge delivery capacity of 229,000 bpd. The terminals primarily 
                                    distribute production from TS O’s refineries in Los Angeles   and Martinez, CA; Kenai, AK; 
                                    Mandan, ND; Salt Lake City, UT; and Anacortes, WA.  

                                    In addition, TLLP owns and operates pipes an  d storage that exclusiv ely serve TSO’s Salt 
                                    Lake City refinery. TLLP’s Salt Lake City pipe  assets include including three short-haul crude 
                                    oil supply pipelines and two short-haul refi ned product delivery pipelines connected to 
                                    third-party interstate pipelines. The Salt   Lake City terminal has 878,000 barrels of 
                                    crude/refined products capacity.  

                                    Segment revenue mix is 75% terminals,           13% transportation,   and 12% storage. 
                                    Approximately 87% of segment revenue is        derived from contracted minimum volume 
                                    commitments with the parent. TSO’s required minimum volumes represent 
                                    86%/80%/100% of terminal/ transportation/sto rage revenues, respectively. Terminalling 
                                    volumes are expected to increase 1.1% (from 2010 average to LTM 1Q12) to 115,200 bpd, 
                                    while transportation volumes are expected to increase 8.5% to 65,800 bpd. Storage volume 
                                    at the Salt Lake City terminal will remain at 878,000 barrels. Similar to the crude oil 
                                    gathering segment, terminalling, storage and tr ansportation fees have inflation protection, 
                                    via CPI adjustment. 

                                    Overview of General Partner 

                                    Tesoro Corporation (TSO) is the general part  ner of TLLP. TSO is a leading independent 
                                    refiner in the U.S. with 665,000 bpd of refining capacity at seven refineries. Geographic 
                                    footprint is primarily western US. Its seven refi neries are located in AK, CA(2), HI, ND, UT 
                                    and WA. In addition, TSO’s retail segment is comprised of 880 branded retail stations under 
                                    the Tesoro®, Shell®, USA GasolineTM and Mirastar® brands.  

                                    For views on TSO, we defer to our equity and  fixed income research analysts covering the 
                                    name. Barclays Capital Integrated Oil and Inde pendent Refining equity analyst Paul Cheng’s 
                                    view on TSO is constructive.  According to the 5/6/11 note titled “Solid 1Q11, Underlying 
                                    Earnings Power Has Been Improving Over the Las t Couple Years,” Cheng states “in the near 
                                    term, we remain cautious on the refiners and th ink that US refiners’ profit margins could be 
                                    weak in the coming months        as light/heavy differentials  and the WTI/Brent spread 
                                    deteriorate while the product crack could remain  relatively sluggish. However, we think the 
                                    California refining market’s me dium to longer term outlook remains bright given its high 
                                    barriers of entry due to its strict product en  vironmental standard and the lack of pipeline 
                                    capacity to effectively import product from the Gulf Coast or other U.S. markets from a cost 
                                    perspective. We are also impressed by the company’s underlying improvement in its margin 
                                    capture rate over the last couple years. In  addition, we think TSO has more potential room 
                                    for efficiency improvement compared to its p eers due to its relative weak performance in 
                                    the past.”

                                    Stromberg has a Market Weight recommend           ation on TSO’s bonds. According to 
                                    Stromberg’s 5/5/11 note “Tesoro (TSO) 1Q11        Credit Review,” recent earnings were a 
                                    “positive credit release, in our view. Quarterly EBITDA was above our expectations on higher 
                                    refinery utilization, strong product crack spre ads and favorable differen tials. Subsequent to

                                      quarter-end, the company received ~$330mn in net proceeds from the Tesoro Logistics 
                                      IPO, and redeemed the $150mn of outstandin  g junior subordinated notes due 2012. Pro 
                                      forma these transactions, we estimate net levera ge to decline to 1.0x, from 1.3x at quarter-
                                      end.” A quick look at TSO's bonds indicates stability as the 6.6% senior notes due 2015 are 
                                      trading at 103 vs. 92 on 6/3/10. Net/net, we vi  ew TSO as a stable customer of TLLP and 
                                      posing little counterparty risk.

                                       TLLP has a standard general partner incentive distribution rights           (IDR) structure of 
                                       2/15/25/50%. Currently, the Partnership is IN the 2% GP split, which results in a low 
                                       adjusted cost of equity capital of approxim      ately 5.55% (as of 6/3/11 close), which is 
                                       favorable for financing future expansion pr       ojects. Based on our distribution growth 
                                       estimates, which includes an assumption of $375MM in acquisitions in total through 2015, 
                                       we estimate TLLP will enter the 50% splits in late 2015.  

                                       Risks 

                                       Customer concentration 
                                       Parent TSO comprises approximately 95% of TLLP’s revenues. However, young 
                                       partnerships generally have a limited customer mix. In our view, this is not a significant 
                                       problem, given TSO is a stable customer (S&P credit rating of BB+ with stable outlook). Over 
                                       time, we expect TLLP to increase third party volumes on its crude oil gathering and 
                                       terminalling businesses throug h organic expansions, acquisit ions, and increased capacity 
                                       utilization. 

                                       Limited track record as MLP 
                                       While its assets were previously housed in  TSO, a C-corp independent refiner, TLLP has a 
                                       limited operating track record as a public MLP, with an IPO in April 20, 2011. 

                                       Taxes 
                                       Removal of MLP tax-advantaged status would   negatively impact TLLP growth prospects. 
                                       We expect MLP tax status to  remain unchanged. In fact, the  definition for MLP qualifying 
                                       income was expanded in 2008 for renewable fuels. Nevertheless, the federal government is 
                                       seeking to review the tax code and there is      potential (or at least headline risk) for pass-
                                       through entity tax status to change.  

                                       Interest rates 
                                       TLLP has interest rate exposure from its        revolving credit facility. A 100 bps increase 
                                       (annualized) in interest rates would increase   TLLP interest expense by $0.5MM or 1% of 
                                       2011e distributable cash flow. In addition, MLP valuations could be impacted by rising 
                                       interest rates similar to bond s. However, unlike bonds, MLP distribution growth somewhat 
                                       offsets higher interest rates.

                                   Equity capital markets 
                                   TLLP’s ability to grow distributions relies on access to external capital. We assume the 
                                   Partnership retains approximately 10% of free cash flow, which means TLLP will finance the 
                                   majority of future expansion ca pital expenditures with debt an d equity capital. As such, a 
                                   higher cost of capital could likely lower TLLP’s distribution growth rate.  

                                   Refined product demand 
                                   While having minimal direct commodity price ex posure, TLLP does have indirect exposure 
                                   as high commodity prices would likely reduce refined product demand. Other potential 
                                   sources of lower demand include weak econom ic conditions, competition from renewable 
                                   substitutes and adverse weather conditions. 

                                   Crude oil production 
                                   Given the High Plains system is a key growth driver for TLLP, the Partnership has exposure 
                                   to crude oil production in the Bakken. Lo  wer-than-expected Bakken production growth 
                                   could impact TLLP’s transportation expansion plans in the region.    

                                   Refinery maintenance 
                                   Unplanned refinery downtime could negatively  impact TSO’s excess volumes, beyond the 
                                   contracted minimum levels, on TLLP’s system.  

                                   Acquisitions 
                                   There is a risk that future TLLP acquisitions fail to meet accretion expectations due to 
                                   integration or valuation risks. 

                                   Regulatory and environmental 
                                   More stringent environmental regulations coul d increase TLLP operating costs and reduce 
                                   growth prospects if higher costs were not able to be passed along to customers. 

                                   Management Team 

                                   TLLP has an experienced management team, av eraging 27 years of experience. In addition, 
                                   TLLP recently added two independent boar d members. On 5/24/11, Tom O’Connor and 
                                   Mary Morgan joined TSO’s board as independ ent directors. The addition increases TSO’s 
                                   board from five to seven members and inde      pendent directors from one to three. A 
                                   summary of TLLP management and board members follows.

ANALYST(S) CERTIFICATION(S) 
We, Richard Gross and Brian J. Zarahn, CFA,   hereby certify (1) that the views expressed  in this research re port accurately refl ect our personal
views about any or all of the subj ect securities or issuers referred to in this resear ch report and (2) no part of our compensa tion was, is or will be 
directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in this research report. 
 

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES CONTINUED 
 
For current important disclosures, including, where relevant, price target charts, regarding companies that are the subject of  this research report,
please send a written request to: Barclays Capital Research Compliance, 745 Seventh Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10019 or r            efer to

The analysts responsible for preparing this  research report have received compensation based upon various factors including the       firm's total
revenues, a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities. 
On September 20, 2008, Barclays Capital acquired Lehman Brothers' North American investment banking, capital markets, and private investment
management businesses.  All ratings and price targets prior to this date relate to coverage under Lehman Brothers Inc. 
Barclays Capital produces a variety of research products including, but not limited to, fundamental analysis, equity-linked ana lysis, quantitative 
analysis, and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type   of research product may differ  from recommendations contained  in other 
types of research products, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, or otherwise. 
Primary Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price) 
Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP, 07-Jun-2011, USD 24.42), 1-Overweight/2-Neutral 
Guide to the Barclays Capital Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating  system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect    or (the “sector
coverage universe”). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which rate the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive, 2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating s ystem.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted  expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12 -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
RS-Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or
to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including when Barclays Capital is acting i     n an advisory 
capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. 
Sector View 
1-Positive - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. 
2-Neutral - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. 
3-Negative - sector coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating. 
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "sector coverage universe":

                                                           current prices. We expect distributions to increase to an annualized rate of

                                                           provides concentration risk. Lower refined product demand could reduce Tesoro

Investment Thesis 
  Long-term, fixed-fee contracts with volume commitments provide cash flow security.  Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) generates 
   a substantial portion of its revenue under long-term, fee-based contracts with Tesoro Corp (“Tesoro” or “parent”).  These contracts 
   include minimum volume commitments and fees that are indexed for inflation, which both support stability of cash flows and limit 
   commodity exposure.  Under the agreements, TLLP provides pipeline transportation, trucking, terminal distribution, and storage 
   services to Tesoro, and Tesoro provides TLLP with minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil and refined products.  The 
   contracts include 10-year pipeline transportation in the Bakken on the High Plains system, a two-year trucking agreement in the 
   Bakken, and 10-year storage and terminalling agreements in TLLP’s Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage segment.  We also 
   expect TLLP to explore other opportunities to provide fee-based services through organic growth projects. 

  Solid near-term organic growth opportunities should be nicely accretive given conservative capital structure out of the box.  
   Tesoro Corp. has historically allocated minimal growth capex to its logistics assets because returns were not sufficient for the 
   refining company (typically 16–20% IRRs), and the assets were viewed as a cost center.  However, these returns are attractive for 
   an MLP structure, and we believe TLLP can spend relatively small levels of capex to optimize the asset base, fill existing capacity, 
   and add new capacity. TLLP exited its IPO with only $50 million in debt (revolver draw) and a leverage ratio of less than 1.0x 
   Debt / 2011 EBITDA. The partnership has additional borrowing capacity on its revolver of $100 million and can expand the 
   revolver by an additional $150 million through the accordion feature.  Given this borrowing capacity, we expect TLLP to easily 
   fund the next $100 million of organic growth capex and drop down payments through debt financing, which should make for more 
   accretive projects.  TLLP has earmarked $15.5 million of near-term organic growth capex over the next two years, which is 
   expected to generate run-rate EBITDA of about $10.5 million.  These projects will focus on filling High Plains system capacity in 
   the Bakken and capturing additional services in the Terminalling segment.  This implies very accretive projects at less than a 2.0x 
   EBITDA multiple and the ability to grow EBITDA by over 20% even assuming no drop downs occur.   

  Significant drop-down potential offers visible ongoing growth.  The initial assets dropped to TLLP in the IPO generate roughly 
   $50 million–$55 million of annual EBITDA.  Tesoro has also identified a portfolio of assets that it has agreed to give the right of 
   first offer (ROFO) to TLLP.  The ROFO assets include three product terminals, two pipelines, and four marine terminals.  Tesoro 
   Corp. has a work team in place focused on prioritizing the potential drop downs.  Some of the projects require more commercial 
   development than others, but we expect a deliberate and ratable asset drop schedule over the next several years (for comparison 
   purposes, the IPO process took six months and involved 10 assets, so we feel this ratable schedule is erring on the side of 
   conservatism).  In total, we estimate that the ROFO assets can generate annual EBITDA of $50 million–$80 million, which 
   provides nice visibility on growth. We model a $50 million asset drop every 6 months beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 using 
   an 8–9x EBITDA multiple (so roughly $5-6 million in annual EBITDA per drop). 

  Asset footprint in regions of high demand and production growth.  TLLP’s High Plains system is a premier crude gathering 
   system in the Williston Basin (Bakken Shale), which is one of the most prolific and active onshore oil producing basins in North 
   America.  RBC estimates North Dakota rig count to increase from 177 rigs currently to about 200 by year end 2011.  While 
   estimates for future Bakken production vary widely, we see some level of consensus for Bakken production to double within the 
   next five years (from about 400 Mbopd currently), and this could prove conservative if the current drilling pace holds.  Tesoro 
   recently announced that it is expanding its capacity at the Mandan refinery (the only refinery within 300 miles of the Bakken) from 
   58,000 Bopd to 68,000 Bopd, which will provide a near-term growth opportunity for TLLP (High Plains’ sole function right now is 
   to feed the Mandan refinery).  In addition, as production in the play grows, there is an increasing need for crude oil takeaway 
   capacity.  We believe that TLLP is well positioned to benefit from this trend, as High Plains is ideally situated to add interconnects 
   to third-party pipelines to increase utilization on the system (TLLP can push 70,000 Bopd to Mandan now, but the system can 
   handle over 100,000 Bopd if interconnects are negotiated). On the terminalling side, TLLP’s assets are primarily located on the 
   West Coast, which is an area of expected growth in refined product demand. 

  TLLP is low in the GP splits, which should benefit the limited partners. TLLP is currently in the 2% general partner splits, 
   which should provide the opportunity for acquisitions to be more accretive to unitholders.  The lower split level lowers the cost of 
   capital versus MLPs higher in the split.

       TLLP Investment Risks 

       We consider two sets of risks when looking at a master limited partnership. First are the risks that come from holding the asset class 
       (think of the different risk profile between sub-sectors, like a regulated pipeline asset versus gathering and processing asset). Second 
       are the risks associated with holding assets in a master limited partnership structure.  

       TLLP-Specific Risks 
         TLLP derives substantially all of its revenue from sponsor Tesoro Corp. and would be adversely affected if it does not satisfy its 
          commercial obligations to TLLP.      

         Lower refined product demand could reduce Tesoro refining margins and volumes of crude and refined products handled by TLLP.  

         The partnership’s assets are concentrated and reduced production in the Bakken Shale could reduce volumes gathered by the High 
          Plains system. 

         Our forecast is dependent on TLLP coming to financial terms with its parent on the drop down assets.  If TLLP does not come to 
          financial terms, or if these terms are not as favorable as our forecast, this could have an impact on our analysis.     

       Overall MLP Risks 
         Credit markets: Valuations are impacted by changes in overall interest rates and credit spreads. Rising interest rates or widening 
          spreads in the credit market tend to negatively impact the valuation of MLPs. 

         Trading liquidity: MLPs tend not to be traded as often as their corporate counterparts mainly due to accumulating tax deferrals. 
          Therefore, trading liquidity is limited in many of the public partnerships. 

         Potential conflicts with general partner: Most MLPs have a GP that is incentivized to grow the distribution pool (either by 
          increasing the distribution and/or issuing more LP equity). This conflict could allow the GP to reap higher economics on 
          transactions while the limited partners achieve minimal accretion or, worse, dilution. In addition, this potential conflict entices the 
          GP to add riskier assets to grow the distribution pool. Investors should pay particular attention to the incentive distribution rights 
          (IDRs) held by the GP; as the “splits” work higher, they could potentially increase the cost of equity capital for the partnership.   

       Valuation 

       Using our multi-stage dividend discount model (DDM) for the LP units, we calculate a 12-month price target of $28/unit, which 
       implies a yield of 5.7% on our one-year-out distribution estimate of $1.57/unit. Our DDM is based on our distribution estimates for the 
       four quarters starting one year out and then a five-year growth rate of 9% (from the current distribution rate, these assumptions result 
       in an annualized growth rate of 13% over the next five years).  We discount our DDM distributions at a rate consistent with our 
       interest rate expectations and the risk associated with an Average risk qualifier.  Our risk qualifier considers and weighs various risk 
       factors, including TLLP's trading liquidity, debt to forward EBITDA of 0.9x, forward total unit coverage of 1.1x, diversification, and 
       commodity exposure. 

       Comparable Company Valuation 
       We believe TLLP deserves a yield premium given the potential for above-average distribution growth over the next several years as 
       the drop down story unfolds.  Based on our analysis of comparable company valuations, TLLP is currently trading at an approximately 
       10% premium to the group on a yield basis. Note that our 2011 and 2012 EBITDA growth estimates assume additional debt balances 
       to complete asset acquisitions while the valuation multiples below use the existing net debt balance of approximately $47 million.

      Distribution Structure and Outlook 
      TLLP Poised to Deliver Outsized Distribution Growth:  TLLP has a minimum quarterly distribution (MQD) of $0.3375 per 
      common unit or $1.35 annualized, representing a 5.5% yield at the current price. We forecast total distributions of $0.9329 in 2011 
      and $1.6230 in 2012, representing 74% growth as the IPO year only includes a partial distribution. However, we expect TLLP to 
      deliver outsized distribution growth with an annualized distribution rate of $1.7730 in the fourth quarter of 2012, which represents 
      25% growth over the $1.4130 rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.    

      Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs):  IDRs, which are owned entirely by the general partner Tesoro Logistics GP, will not be 
      triggered until common and subordinated unit holders receive an aggregate distribution of $0.388125.  

      Subordinated Units:  Tesoro Corp. owns all of the 15.3 million subordinated units, or 49% of the total outstanding limited partner 
      interest. The subordinated units can receive the MQD only after the common units have received the MQD and any arrearages from 
      prior quarters. The subordination period ends after TLLP has paid the MQD for three consecutive years on or after June 30, 2014 or 
      150% of the MQD ($2.025) for the four quarters prior to that date.

are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale, West Coast, Ro                       ckies and Alaska with potential drop          -downs near 

existing infrastructure.        

TLLP   was formed via an initial public offering on             April   19 , 2011  , when   Tesoro Corp     .,  as the sole selling shareholder      , sold   13 ,000,000

concurrently entered a $150 million           cre dit facility and drew $50       million   to fund an additional distribution to Tesoro.             Following the 

offering and full exercise of the        1 ,9 5 0,000 over  -allotment option,      Tesoro Corp.     owns   0.3  million    common units,      all  15.3  million

Tesoro Corp. owns a 2.0% interest in all distributions in addition to holding 100% of the incentive distribution rights above minimum 

and target distribution levels.  The incentive distribution rights entitle the general partner to receive increasing percentages, up to 48%, 

of distributions from operating surplus after pre-defined distribution targets.

     Crude Oil Gathering Segment 
     The partnership’s common carrier High Plains system in North Dakota and Montana consists of 23,000 bpd truck-based crude 
     gathering capacity and 700 miles of pipeline and storage assets with capacity to deliver up to 70,000 bpd to Tesoro’s 58,000 bpd 
     Mandan, ND refinery (the only refinery within 300 miles of the Bakken). We believe the High Plains assets present significant organic 
     expansion opportunities, including capturing third party volumes and replacing truck-gathered volumes with higher margin pipe 
     connections. The partnership expects minimum contracted volumes under agreements with Tesoro to account for approximately 88% 
     and 97% of 2011 pipeline and trucking volumes, respectively Exhibit 5 provides a summary of the High Plains assets.

     Crude Oil Gathering Organic Growth Opportunities 
     Mandan Refinery Expansion: Tesoro parent recently announced plans to increase capacity at its Mandan refinery from 58,000 Bopd 
     to 68,000 Bopd, with expected in-service in the second quarter of 2012.  TLLP has identified $6.6 million of capital opportunities over 
     the next 12 months to support the Mandan expansion.  We expect this capex to drive an additional $6.4 million of EBITDA on an 
     annual basis after completion in the second quarter of 2012, which implies an approximately $4.3 million contribution to full year 
     2012 EBITDA.

24.0 Other Organic Growth Opportunities: Beyond what has been identified to support the Mandan refinery expansion, we believe 
     TLLP may also pursue opportunities to capture growing Bakken take-away demand in addition to its Mandan volumes.   
                                                            23.4
23.5
       Notably, referring back to 23.3
                                   Exhibit 5, TLLP has the potential to interconnect with pipelines at Portal, Fritz, and Fryburg in North 
        Dakota and with the Bridger Pipelin23.0
         23.0                               e in Richey, MT.  While TLLP can currently push 70,000 Bopd to the Mandan refinery (stated 
23.0
        capacity on the system), the physical capacity is over 100,000 Bopd if these interconnects can be negotiated.  Two or three o22.7f the 
        interconnects are very low capex requirements (basically turning a valve) and two or three of the interconnects are a bit more 
22.5
        capital intensive.  Regardless, we believe this is a nice source of potential growth. 

       We believe TLLP may look at opportunities to move crude oil away from the Bakken (including to the West Coast), and this could 
22.0
        include capital spent around Mandan to give the MLP that capability. 

21.5   Within the trucking segment, TLLP also may be able to better optimize its fleet over time, as the partnership currently utilizes 55% 
        third-party trucks.  This is primarily due to the difficulty to obtain and retain drivers, but if TLLP is able to increase its proprietary 
21.0    mix, we believe this could have some positive impact on results. 
         2009         2010         2011        2012         2013
       We also believe that the partnership will seek to engage producers to replace truck-gathered volumes with pipeline volumes, which 
        offers a higher margin.   

                                                                                                                                          8

Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage Segment  

The partnership’s Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage assets are located primarily on the West Coast and are comprised of eight 
refined products terminals and a refined products and crude storage facility with related short-haul pipelines serving Tesoro’s Salt 
Lake City refinery. The product terminals have 229,000 bpd aggregate truck and barge delivery capacity and primarily support 
Tesoro’s Los Angeles, Golden Eagle, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. The partnership expects minimum 
contracted volumes under agreements with Tesoro to account for approximately 86% and approximately 90% of total 2011 terminal 
and pipeline throughput, respectively. Exhibit 9 provides a summary overview of the refined product terminals.

     Terminalling, Transportation & Storage Organic Growth Opportunities 

     TLLP has identified $8.9 million of capital opportunities over the next nine months within the segment, which we expect to drive an 
     additional $4.5 million of annualized EBITDA when complete by the first quarter of 2012.  Spending on the projects, which are 
     outlined in Exhibit 12, will mostly occur in 2011 and we estimate an approximately $3.4 million impact to full year 2012 EBITDA.  In 
300.0
     general, we believe TLLP’s greatest opportunities within the terminalling segment will be tapping third-party volumes.  Third-party 
     volumes were not actively pursued under Tesoro’s control 244.7(so as to keep optionality open), but we believe the MLP will be better 
250.0
     positioned to optimize the existing asset base. In addition to the identified opportunities, we believe TLLP can pursue further 
     expansions and optimization opportunities, representing upside to our estimates.

The Drop-Down Opportunity 
TLLP has articulated a three-pronged strategy for distribution growth, which includes optimizing the existing asset base and capturing 
additional third-party volume, pursuing organic growth projects, and acquiring complementary logistics assets.  On the acquisition 
front, Tesoro has granted the partnership a right of first offer to acquire certain of its logistics assets, providing a pipeline of low-
hanging growth opportunities over the next several years.    

Right of First Offer (ROFO) Assets 
TLLP has right of first offer to acquire certain Tesoro logistics assets including terminals, pipelines, docks and storage facilities 
located in Alaska, California and Washington. Management has identified an inventory of assets with gross book value of $240 
million. Tesoro parent has a work team in place focused on prioritizing the potential drop downs.  Some of the projects require more 
commercial development than others, but we expect a deliberate and ratable asset drop schedule over the next several years (for 
comparison purposes, the IPO process took six months and involved 10 assets, so we feel this ratable schedule is erring on the side of 
conservatism).  In total, we estimate that the ROFO assets can generate annual EBITDA of $50 million–$80 million.   

We summarize the primary ROFO assets identified by the partnership in Exhibit 13.

Our cash flow and distribution growth projections assume TLLP consummates $50 million of asset drops every other quarter 
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 with an average transaction multiple of 8-9x EBITDA, which implies annual EBITDA 
contributions of $5.5 million–$6.25 million per transaction. During our forecast period ended December 2013, we assume five 
transactions totalling $250 million at a 9.0x EBITDA multiple resulting in an ~$27.8 million cumulative EBITDA contribution (see 
Exhibit 14 below). Our asset drop assumptions drive our outsized annualized distribution growth estimates of +25% and +23% for the 
fourth quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2013 respectively.  Our full year distribution growth estimates for 2012 and 2013 of 74% 
and 25% are skewed by the fact that 2011 is a partial distribution year.

        We believe TLLP’s solid financial position will allow it to deliver highly accretive growth through acquisitions in the near-term 

        without the need for additional equity raises in the foreseeable future. After the IPO, TLLP has only $50 million of debt outstanding 

        under its $150 million revolver which equates to ~0.9x Debt / forward EBITDA and ~12x of forward interest coverage.  In addition to 

        $100 million of current availability, the credit facility can ultimately be increased to $300 million with additional lender commitments.

        Balance Sheet 

        TLLP has $50 million of outstanding long-term debt, which was a $50 million draw on its revolver.  The partnership has an additional 

        $100 million of revolver availability, which we expect to be utilized over the next year to fund organic growth and drop down 

        acquisitions.  We expect debt/EBITDA to increase from ~0.9x currently to around 3.0x by year end 2012 and 3.5x by year end 2013, 

        which is at the high end of management’s comfort zone.  If the partnership undertakes larger or more numerous transactions than those 

        assumed in our model, an equity issuance would likely be necessary.  

        Debt covenants are fairly relaxed, as the credit facility allows debt/EBITDA to increase to 4.5x for an acquisition, thereby allowing it 
($ in MM, except per share data & ratios)

    The Bakken Shale Advantage 

    Well Positioned for Bakken Shale / Williston Basin Production Growth:  The Bakken Shale is a leading unconventional oil 
    producing zone within the Williston Basin, which extends across North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and parts of southern Canada. 
    After a 2008 study, the US Geological Survey classified the Bakken as the largest “continuous” oil accumulation assessed by it to 
    date, with 3.0 – 4.3 BBbls of technically recoverable reserves. TLLP’s High Plains assets are uniquely levered to Bakken production 
    growth which should remain robust as favorable economics drive increasing rig counts.

Valuation
Using our multi-stage dividend discount model (DDM) for the LP units, we calculate a 12-month price target of $28/unit, which
implies a yield of 5.7% on our one-year-out distribution estimate of $1.57/unit. Our DDM is based on our distribution estimates for the
four quarters starting one year out and then a five-year growth rate of 9% (from the current distribution rate, these assumptions result
in an annualized growth rate of 13% over the next five years). We discount our DDM distributions at a rate consistent with our interest
rate expectations and the risk associated with an Average risk qualifier. Our risk qualifier considers and weighs various risk factors,
including TLLP's trading liquidity, debt to forward EBITDA of 0.9x, forward total unit coverage of 1.1x, diversification, and
commodity exposure.

Price Target Impediment
Among the key issues that could impede our price target are:
 Acquisition risk;
 Damage to pipeline infrastructure;
 Commodity price risks;
 TLL is dependent on Tesoro Corp parent for substantially all of its revenue, so any inability to meet its requirements with Tesoro
  would negatively impact results.
 Trading liquidity in the units is relatively low; and
 Other risks, including prolonged declines in volumes, interest rates, and regulatory risk.
Company Description
TLLP is a growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro to operate its gathering and processing and short-haul pipelines, trucking and
terminalling logistics assets. The partnership intends to operate its assets under long-term, minimum volume contracts with Tesoro and
pursue asset drop-down growth opportunities. The initial assets are strategically located near Tesoro refineries in the Bakken Shale,
West Coast, Rockies and Alaska with potential drop-downs near existing infrastructure.

Conflicts Disclosures
This product constitutes a compendium report (covers six or more subject companies). As such, RBC Capital Markets chooses to
provide specific disclosures for the subject companies by reference. To access current disclosures for the subject companies, clients
should refer to https://www.rbccm.com/GLDisclosure/PublicWeb/DisclosureLookup.aspx?entityId=1 or send a request to RBC CM
Research Publishing, P.O. Box 50, 200 Bay Street, Royal Bank Plaza, 29th Floor, South Tower, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7.

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors, including total
revenues  of  the  member  companies  of  RBC  Capital  Markets  and  its  affiliates,  a  portion  of  which  are  or  have  been  generated  by
investment banking activities of the member companies of RBC Capital Markets and its affiliates.

Distribution of Ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories - Buy,
Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick/Outperform,
Sector Perform and Underperform most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same
because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

Conflicts Policy
RBC Capital Markets Policy for Managing Conflicts of Interest in Relation to Investment Research is available from us on request. To
access our current policy, clients should refer to
https://www.rbccm.com/global/file-414164.pdf
or  send  a  request  to  RBC  CM  Research  Publishing,  P.O.  Box  50,  200  Bay  Street,  Royal  Bank  Plaza,  29th  Floor,  South  Tower,

Dissemination of Research and Short-Term Trading Calls
RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having regard
to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary websites to ensure
eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional distribution
may be done by the sales personnel via email, fax or regular mail. Clients may also receive our research via third-party vendors. Please
contact  your  investment  advisor  or  institutional  salesperson  for  more  information  regarding  RBC  Capital  Markets'  research.  RBC
Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firm's proprietary INSIGHT website. SPARC contains
market color and commentary, and may also contain Short-Term Trade Ideas regarding the publicly-traded common equity of subject
companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. SPARC may be accessed via the following hyperlink:
https://www.rbcinsight.com. A Short-Term Trade Idea reflects the research analyst's directional view regarding the price of the subject
company's publicly-traded common equity in the coming days or weeks, based on market and trading events. A Short-Term Trade
Idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the research analyst's views of
the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons, methodologies and/or other
factors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  subject  company's  common  equity  that  is  considered  a  long-term  'sector  perform'  or  even  an
'underperform' might be a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market; conversely, a subject
company's common equity rated a long-term 'outperform' could be considered susceptible to a short-term downward price correction.
Short-Term Trade Ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the Firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes
any obligation, to maintain or update Short-Term Trade Ideas. Securities and Short-Term Trade Ideas discussed in SPARC may not be
suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make
their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.

Company Description: 
Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
I. GP Sponsor Supports Growth From Acquisitions And Stability In Cash Flow 
 
Tesoro Corporation (TSO). TLLPs strategic relationship with its GP sponsor Tesoro Corporation enhances 
the partnerships growth prospects, in our view. TSO serv es as a strong partner to jointly pursue third-party 
acquisitions and as a source for potential drop-down ac  quisitions. TSO has a sizeable portfolio of logistics 
assets, which the partnership could acquire over time to augment distribution growth. As TLLPs largest 
customer, TSO also supports stability in the partnershi  ps cash flow through its long-term transportation, 
terminalling, and storage agreements with minimum volume commitments. 
 
Tesoro Corporation is one of the leading independent refining companies in the United States. The company 
operates seven refineries primarily located in the Western United States with total refining capacity of 664,500 
barrels (bbls) per day. In addition to refining assets,   the company has a network of  880 retail stations in 15 
states that sell transportati on fuels primarily under the  Tesoro, Shell, USA Gasoline, and  Mirastar brands. 
Founded in 1968, TSO was originally  focused on the exploration and produc tion of crude oil. In 1969, TLLP 
purchased its first refinery near Kenai, Alaska. During the 1990s, TSO began to focus on its petroleum and 
marketing businesses and sold non-core assets including its exploration and production operations. From 1998 
to 2002, TSO acquired refineries in Hawaii, Washingt  on, North Dakota, Utah, and California. In 2007, the 
company acquired the Los Angeles refinery and 278    Shell-branded retail stations from Shell Oil Products. 
During this ten-year period, TSO increased its total refining capacity to 664,500 bbls per day from 72,000 bbls 
per day. The company is now the second-largest independent refiner and marketer in the United States, with 
an enterprise value of approximately $5 billion. 
 
II. Investment Highlights 
 
    (1)  A Play On Infrastructure Development In The Bakken Shale 
     
We believe TLLP offers investors an  attractive way to participate in the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale 
infrastructure. Crude oil gathering revenue from this region (i.e., the High Plains System) is expected to 
account for 53% of the partnerships total revenue proj  ected for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012 (S-1 
guidance). There are several larger MLPs that are investing in the Bakken Shale, but their potential upside is 
less impactful, in our view, given the  relative size and geographic diversity of these partnerships. TLLP owns a 
crude oil gathering system tied to production from the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin. The High Plains System 
includes 700 miles of pipeline with the capacity to de liver up to 70,000 bbls per day to TSOs Mandan, North 
Dakota refinery and trucking operations that gather about 23,000 bbls per day of crude oil from the region.  
 
We anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the  Bakken Shale to be a driver  of organic growth for the 
partnership over time. TLLP already has committed to one project (i.e., an expansion of its High Plains System 
by Q2 2012 to accommodate the capacity addition at  TSOs Mandan refinery). The partnership has identified 
other potential opportunities that   have not been incorporated in it    s S-1 guidance. At this juncture, 
management has not quantified the potential amount of investments. For modeling purposes, we have 
assumed growth capex of $25 million   annually in 2012-16, which may prove to be conservative. TLLPs 
potential projects in the Bakken Shale include the following: 
 
    (1)  Expansion of the High Plains System through the co nstruction of additional gathering lines to access 
        new drilling locations. 
    (2)  To establish additional outlet connections between the High Plains System and third-party regional 
        pipelines, which would increase optionality for shippers and capture incremental third-party volume. 
        Management has identified five potential interconnections that it believes could be accomplished with 
        minimal capital: Enbridges pipelines at Ramburg,  North Dakota and Portal at the U.S./Canadian 
        border, and True Companies Bridger pipeline at Richey, Montana, Belle Fourche pipeline at Fritz, 
        North Dakota, and Little Missouri pipelines at Fryburg, North Dakota. 
    (3)  Increase High Plains Systems throughput capacity with additional pumping capacity. 
    (4)  Construction of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan  refinery to increase the Williston Basin takeaway 
        capacity for crude oil.

Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                                 EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

The Bakken Shale is one of the major emerging oil plays in North America. It is a key crude oil resource with 
approximately 4.0-6.3 billion bbls of recoverable reserv es (including the underlying Three Forks formation), 
according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral        Resources. This compares  with total U.S. proved 
reserves of 19.1 billion bbls. The Bakken play is a formation in the Williston Basin, which is spread across parts 
of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Canada. Development in the Bakken Shale has accelerated given 
the favorable crude oil price environment, advancements in drilling technologies, and E&P companies focus 
on liquids-rich areas due to more fa  vorable economics. Specifically, the rig count tied to the play in North 
Dakota has increased 130% year over year, to 128 rigs as of May 6, 2011, from 98 rigs in the comparable year 
ago period, according to the Land Rig Newsletter.      The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources 
forecasts that oil production in No rth Dakota could reach 450,000-700,0 00 bbls per day within the next 3-7 
years. For the U.S. portion of the  Williston Basin, crude oil production  could ramp up to 550,000-800,000 
bbls per day during the 2015-2020 time frame, according to the state agency. 
 
    (2)  Visible Multiyear Growth Outlook 
     
Current slate of organic growth projects provides visible/meaningful upside potential. TLLP has 
earmarked $15.5 million of growth capex over the next two years. Incrementa l cash flow from these projects is 
expected to result in an 18% year-over-year increase in EBITDA for the 12 months ending March 31, 2013. The 
sizeable increase is primarily attributable to the attrac tive returns from enhancing TLLPs existing assets (i.e., 
an EBITDA multiple of less than 2x) and the relatively small size of the partnership (percentage change is more 
meaningful off of a smaller base, all else being equal). 
 
As previously noted, TSO plans to   increase the capacity at its Mandan   refinery by 10,000 bbls per day to 
68,000 bbls per day by Q2 2012. TLLP plans to spend ab out $6.5 million to add pu mping, tankage, and truck 
unloading capacity to its High Plains System to support the Mandan refinery expansion. The partnership is 
also investing approximately $9 million to increase capacity and enhance its service capabilities at its terminals 
(e.g., ethanol blending, transmix). Specifically, TLLP is adding 8,000 bbls of storage capacity at Stockton by Q1 
2012 for $4.5 million, ethanol blending capabilities at Sa lt Lake City and Burley in H1 2012 for $2.4 million, 
and transmix receipt services at its Los Angeles terminal by Q1 2012 for $2.0 million.  
 
Modest distribution growth even absent acquisitions. According to our model, TLLP is well positioned 
to deliver a five-year distribution CAGR of 6.0%, assu   ming the $15.5 million of identified projects noted 
previously, $25 million of annual growth capex at an      average EBITDA multiple of 6.0x in 2012-16, no 
acquisitions, and a distribution covera  ge ratio of 1.1x. Alternatively, if we assume that TLLP undertakes  
$250 million ($50 million annually at an EBITDA mult       iple of 6.0x) of organic   growth initiatives and no 
acquisitions, this would increase our five-year distribution CAGR estimate to 7.9%, all else equal. 
 
Upside beyond organic growth could  potentially come from acquisitions.  We forecast a five-year 
distribution CAGR of 9.1% predicated on assumed acqu isitions of approximately $500 million in 2012-16 (or a 
$100 million transaction each year) completed at an EBITDA multiple of 10x and average annual growth capex 
of approximately $25 million during that period. Potential acquisitions will likely be a mix of drop-downs from 
TSO and third-party acquisitions, in our view. 
 
All else being equal, we forecast th at a $50 million increase or decrease  in our assumed acquisition spending 
estimate will increase or decrease our five-year distribution CAGR by roughly 1-2%, depending on the EBITDA 
multiple assumed (i.e., lowe r multiples imply higher gr owth leverage from acquis ition spending). Figure 1 
illustrates the sensitivity of our distribution growth fore cast to varying levels of  assumed acquisition spending 
and EBITDA multiples. Key assumptions used in this analysis are as follows: 
 
    •   Acquisition multiples in the range of 9-11x EBITDA.  
    •   Maintenance capex of approximately 9% of EBITDA, wh ich is in line with TLLPs guidance for the 12 
         months ending March 31, 2012. 
    •   Acquisitions in 2012 financed 100% with debt given that TLLP currently has only $50 million of debt 
         outstanding. We estimate 50% debt and 50% equity  financing thereafter. Finally, we assume a long-
         term average interest rate of 6.75% and yield of 6.25% for the equity portion of the financing.

Source:  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC estimates 
 
Drop-down of TSOs remaining logistics a           ssets could double the size of TLLP.    Based on an 
acquisition multiple of 10x EBITDA, we estimate a  pproximately $660-680 million  of immediate drop-down 
potential for TLLP. Management has not disclosed the earnings generated by TSOs remaining portfolio of 
midstream assets. However, it did note that the aggregate gross book value of TSOs retained logistics assets 
was $240 million as of December 31, 2010. This compares with the gross book value of $193 million for the 
assets currently in TLLP. Assuming that the relative gross book values are proportionate to cash flow, EBITDA 
of potential drop-down assets could approximate $66         million. Alternatively, we estimate EBITDA of  
$68 million for TSOs remaining portfo lio of midstream assets based on   the assets average throughput in 
2009 and 2010, estimated market-based rates, and margins in line with TLLPs S-1 guidance.  
 
Entitled to right of first offer fo r future TSO midstream divestitures.  For a period of ten years after 
its IPO, TLLP has a right of first offer to acquire certai n logistics assets if TSO decides to sell them. Potential 
drop-down assets include three terminals, two pipeli    nes, and five marine term    inals located in Alaska, 
California, and Washingt on. Having the right of first offer on subs  tantially all of TSOs potential midstream 
divestitures should mitigate competition with third part ies for future acquisition opportunities, which we view 
as a significant benefit for the partnership. 
 
(3)     TLLP Has A Relatively Low-Risk Business Model And Stable Cash Flow 
 
100% fee-based revenues with no direct commodity exposure.   TLLP derives 100% of its cash flow 
from fee-based, transportation, term inalling, and storage contracts with  limited volumetric risk. Essentially, 
the partnership receives a fee per unit (bbl) handled by its gathering system, terminals, pipelines, and/or 
storage assets. It does not take title to the product it  handles and has no direct exposure to the price of crude 
oil or refined products. Accordingly,   TLLPs cash flow should be relati  vely stable, in our view. While the 
partnership has no direct   commodity exposure, changes in commodity   prices can ultimately affect the 
partnerships volume. For example, if crude oil prices were to decline significantly, the development of the 
Bakken Shale could slow down. Consequently, a decrease in  producer drilling activity in the region could lower 
TLLPs future gathering throughput, thereby, decreasing cash flow. 
 
Long-term commercial agreements with TSO bolster stability of cash flow. TSO is the partnerships 
primary customer and accounted for 93% of TLLPs pro forma 2010 EBITDA. The company is expected to 
account for 97% of the partnerships revenue for the 12  months ending March 31, 2012, compared to 96% of 
pro forma 2010 revenue. Notably, TLLPs contracts wi  th TSO are long-term in nature. For the High Plains 
System, TLLP entered into a ten-year crude oil gath    ering and transportation agreement and a two-year 
trucking transportation services agreement with TSO, which is the primary shipper on the system. In addition, 
TLLP secured a ten-year services agreement for all eight of its terminals and ten-year transportation and 
storage contracts for its assets in Sa lt Lake City. All ten-year agreements  may be renewed for two additional 
five-year terms at TSOs option. The trucking contract  will automatically be extended for successive two-year 
terms, up to a maximum of ten years. These long-term agreements should provide the partnership with a 
reliable stream of cash flow into the future, in our view.

Ten-year minimum volume commitments also  mitigate volatility of cash flow.   Unlike for many 
other midstream operators, TLLPs volumetric risk is limited through a minimum volume commitment feature 
in all of its agreements with TSO. Th is feature should mitigate the sensitiv ity of the partnerships cash flow to 
variability in throughput volume for the first ten year  s of the partnerships existence. Notably, management 
estimates that 84% of TLLPs projecte d revenue for the 12 months ending  March 31, 2012, is supported by its 
minimum volume commitments (i.e., $81.7 million out of $97.3 million). This implies that TLLPs distribution 
coverage ratio would approximate 0.73x (cash flow deficit of $11.4 million) if  the partnership realized only the 
minimum volume during that time frame and did not realize a commensurate decrease in operating expenses. 
 
Annual fee escalators should offset po tential inflationary cost pressures.  The High Plains pipeline 
rate is subject to the Federal Ener  gy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in dexing methodology. Based on the 
formula of PPI plus 2.65%, TLLP should benefit from a 6.8% rate increase in July 2011. TLLPs terminalling 
fees and Salt Lake City transportation  and storage fees are subject to auto matic annual escalators. This should 
help mitigate the impact of potential increases in the partnerships cost structure in the future. The fees are 
adjusted annually by a percentage equal to the change in the consumer price index. Alternatively, if 
management is successful in keeping expenses level, the  annual rate increases should result in modest margin 
growth, all else being equal.  
 
(4)     Conservative Capital Structure Provides Flexibility To Pursue Growth Objectives 
 
Strong balance sheet. With only $50 million of debt outstanding  and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0x, TLLP 
has the financial flexibility to pursue organic growth in itiatives and acquisitions, in  our view. The partnership 
has a $150 million revolving credit facility, which expire s in April 2014, with a $150 million accordion feature. 
This provides TLLP the option to me  aningfully increase its borrowing ca pacity in the future. TLLPs total 
liquidity of $100 million should be more than suffi     cient to finance its estimated 2011 growth capital 
expenditures of approximately $8 million. 
 
We believe that TLLP will maintain  a strong balance sheet and a relatively  conservative capital structure of 
50% debt and 50% equity over the long term. We foreca st that the partnership could end 2011 and 2012 with a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x and 2.6x, respectively. This  compares favorably to the median ratio of 4.0x for 
other small-cap pipeline MLPs. 
 
For 2012, we forecast that TLLP will spend $25 million     of growth capex. Our model also incorporates a  
$100 million acquisition assumption in Q1 financed with 100% debt. We forecast that the partnership could 
end 2012 with $76 million of liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x, which compares with the maximum 
permitted covenant threshold of 4.0x. 
 
IDR reset option enables management   to better control co st of capital.  Similar to other MLPs, 
TLLP has an IDR reset option in its partnership agreement. The reset option gives management better 
control of the partnerships cost of capital over the long term and allows TLLP to better compete for 
acquisitions and/or invest in orga nic projects that would otherwise not be accretive when the partnership 
becomes deep in the splits, in our view. As stipulated by the agreement, the general partner (TSO) holds the 
right to reset, at higher levels, the minimum quarterly distribution an  d incentive distribution levels. The 
cumulative cash flow accruing to the GP would not be     altered, but instead, the fu ture cash flow stream is 
affected. 
 
III. Overview Of TLLPs Assets  
 
TLLP owns and operates crude oil and refined product logistics assets. Specifically, the partnership owns crude 
oil gathering pipelines and a truck-ba sed crude oil gathering operation ti ed to production from the Bakken 
Shale/Williston Basin (i.e., the High Plains System). The system supplies crude oil to TSOs Mandan refinery in 
North Dakota. In addition, TLLP owns  and operates eight refined product  terminals with associated storage 
facilities located primarily in the Western United States, and five short-haul pipelines and storage assets in Salt 
Lake City, Utah. TLLPs terminalling assets are primarily  tied to TSOs refinery operations and play an integral 
role in helping TSO distribute refined products to market.

We expect TLLPs Crude Oil Gathering Segment (the High Plains System) to account for a significant portion 
of the partnerships cash flow (i.e., 56% of our pro   forma 2011 EBITDA forecast). For the 12 months ending 
March 31, 2012, management expects the segment to acco unt for approximately 53% of TLLPs total revenue. 
TSO plans to expand the capacity at its Mandan refine ry to 68,000 bbls per day from 58,000 bbls per day (i.e., 
a 17% increase in total refining capacity). Concurrently, TLLP plans to spend approximately $6-7 million of 
growth capex on its High Plains system to accommodate                 the expected capacity increase by Q2 2012. Excluding 
the impact of potential acquisitions, we believe that the partnerships gathering operations in the Bakken Shale 
will be the primary driver of growth in the near term (i.e., 58% of 2013 estimated EBITDA (excluding 
acquisitions), versus 56% of 2011E pro forma EBITDA). 
 
TLLPs Assets In The Bakken Shale 
 
Pipeline operations. Currently, TLLP operates approximately 700 miles of gathering and trunk lines tied to 
the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in North Dakota and                    Montana. The system also has access to Canadian 
crude oil through connections with third-party pipeline s. The partnership gathers crude oil (up to 70,000 bbls 
per day) for shipment to TSOs Mandan refinery in                  central North Dakota. TLLPs crude gathering system 
includes the following: 

           (1)  Approximately 143 miles of up to 6-inch injection lines in western North Dakota and eastern 
                Montana,  

           (2)  474 miles of up to 12-inch gathering and trunk lines in Montana and North Dakota, which lead to 
                TLLPs Dunn Center crude storage facility in North Dakota, and  

           (3)  Approximately 88 miles of 16-inch trunk lines,  which transport crude oi l from the Dunn Center 
                storage facility to TSOs Mandan refinery  

As shown in Figure 3, the High Plains System can re                 ceive crude oil at connection points with the Bridger 
pipeline (at Richey, Montana), Enbrid ges North Dakota System (at Rambur g, North Dakota), and Enbridges 
pipeline on the Canadian border (at Portal, North Dakota).  
 
TLLPs pipelines gathered an average of 50,695 bbls per day and 52,806 bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 
2009. Management estimates average pipeline volume of approximately 58,000 bbls per day for the 12 months 
ending March 31, 2012.

Trucking operations.  TLLP also utilizes trucks to gather crud  e oil from wells that are not connected to 
gathering pipelines. Local producers contact TLLP when they have crude oil  ready to be delivered onto TLLPs 
High Plains system. TLLP uses both proprietary and third-party trucks to gather crude oil from nearby wells or 
collection points and deliver onto TLLPs High Plains  system through one of the partnerships 13 proprietary 
truck unloading facilities. TLLPs trucking operation ga thered an average of 23,305 bbls per day and 22,963 
bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 2009. Management estimates that these trucks will gather 
approximately 22,900 bbls per day of crude oil for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.  
 
TLLPs Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage Segment 
 
TLLP also operates eight refined product terminals primarily located in the Western United States, with total 
terminalling capacity of 239,000 bbls per day and storage capacity of 1,627,000 bbls. The terminals are located 
in the states of California, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah,  and Washington. In Salt Lake City, the partnership also 
owns 13 refined product and crude oi             l storage tanks with 878,000 bbls            of capacity and five short-haul 
pipelines, which serve TSOs nearby refinery. 
 
Terminals.  TLLPs  terminals provide distribution, truck load                   ing, storage, inventory management, and 
blending services to its cust omers. The partnerships eight  terminals primarily receiv e refined products from 
pipelines connected to TSOs Los Angeles, Martinez, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. 
Revenue is generated largely from th  roughput fees for delivering refined product from TLLPs terminals to 
trucks and barges. TLLP also generates revenue from providing ancillary services such as blending, jet fuel 
filtering, and additive injections at certain terminals.

TLLPs terminals handle gasoline and gasoline blendstock s, 72% of 2010 volume, diesel fuel, 23%, and jet fuel, 
5%. TSO accounted for nearly all (i.e., 92%) of TLLPs   terminal volume in 2010. TLLP expects this figure to 
decrease over time as a result of its efforts to secure additional third-party volume. 
 
Salt Lake City storage facility and pipelines.  TLLP owns crude oil and refined product pipelines and an 
878,000 bbl storage facility, which excl  usively support TSOs 58,000 bbls   per day Salt Lake  City refinery. 
These assets were purchased by TSO in 2001 in connection                 with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City refinery 
from BP. TLLPs logistics assets facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products into and out of TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. Approximately 41% of the refine  rys yield is distributed vi a a third-party pipeline to 
TLLPs Burley and Boise Terminals. Further details of TLLPs Salt Lake City assets follow: 
 

          (1)  Crude oil and refined product storage. TLLP owns 13 crude oil and refined product storage 
                tanks with total shell capacity of 878,000 bbls.            The storage tanks are co nnected to TSOs Salt 
                Lake City refinery though four proprietary pipe lines. The crude oil stor age tanks supply the Salt 
                Lake City refinery, while the refined product st            orage tanks store the refinerys product yield 
                including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. 

          (2)  Crude oil pipelines. TLLP owns three crude oil pipelines (8, 10, and 16 inches), which are each 
                approximately two miles long. These pipelines tr              ansport crude oil from   a Chevron interstate 
                pipeline and Plains All Americans Pacific cr               ude oil pipeline to TLLPs storage facility. 
                Approximately 79% of the Salt Lake City refinery              s crude oil feedstock is delivered by TLLPs 
                short-haul crude oil pipelines.

        (3)  Refined product pipelines.  TLLP also has two (6 and 8 inch) refined product pipelines, 
             which transport gasoline and diesel three miles from TSOs refinery to Chevrons Northwest 
             Pipeline.  
In 2010, TLLPs Salt Lake City pipe  line throughput averaged 60,666 bbls per day, versus an average of  
62,822 bbls per day in 2009, and the three-year averag  e of 64,126 bbls per day.  Management estimates an 
average throughput of 65,800 bbls per day for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012. 
 
IV. Risks 
 
Risks Specific To TLLP 
 
Customer concentration.  In 2010, TSO accounted for 96% of TLLPs total revenue and 92% of the 
partnerships terminalling throughput. Thus, a disruption  to TSOs refinery operations and/or a change in 
TSOs financial position could negatively affect the partnerships cash flow and future growth. 
 
Slower-than-forecasted drop-downs from TSO.    TLLPs distribution growth prospects are highly 
dependent on acquisitions from its GP sponsor, in our view. If there is a delay in the drop-down of assets to the 
partnership, TLLPs ability to grow could be slower than forecasted. 
 
Geographic concentration in Bakken Shale.  Currently, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from its 
operations in the Bakken Shale region. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2012, TLLPs crude oil gathering 
system in the Bakken Shale is expected to account for 53 % of total revenue. If TSOs Mandan refinery were to 
experience any disruptions for a prolonged period of     time, this could have a negative impact on the 
partnerships primary source of revenue. 
 
Lower refining margin. A decrease in TSOs refining margin could materially affect the amount of crude oil 
and refined products handled by TLLP. Margin could deteriorate if crude oil (feedstock) prices increase and/or 
refined product prices decrease due to lower demand (i.e., economic weakness, high unemployment, inventory 
levels, etc.). Weak refining margin could cause TSO to  reduce refined product production at its refineries, 
which could result in lower throughput volume for the MLPs assets. 
 
Declining production. The partnerships crude oil gathering volume is dependent on the production profiles 
of the Bakken Shale. Lower-than-expected production volume, inability to secure incremental volume to offset 
declining wells, or a decline in drilling activity due to   lower crude oil prices or rising costs could negatively 
affect future earnings and cash flow. 
 
Lower commodity prices.  While TLLP currently has no direct co  mmodity price risk, a majority of its 
revenue is tied to the exploration and production operations of producers in the Bakken Shale. Lower crude oil 
prices could have the potential to dramatically decrea se producers drilling activity and consequently, the 
partnerships throughput volume. 
 
Risks Applicable To All Energy MLPs 
 
Legislative risk. The potential for U.S. tax reform, which could result in the corporate taxation of pass-
through entities, is a risk for MLPs. Discussion around   carried interest, derivative legislation, and cap and 
trade could also result in headline legislative risk.  
 
Access to capital markets. MLPs are dependent on debt and equity markets to finance growth projects and 
acquisitions. A dislocation in either of these market   s could reduce a partnerships ability to increase 
distributions, as investments would become more expensive on the margin. 
 
A severe economic downturn.  Energy demand is closely linked to overall economic growth. A severe 
economic downturn could reduce the demand for energy and commodity products, which could result in lower 
earnings and cash flow. 
 
Interest rate risk.  As evidenced from the period 1998-99, ML  Ps have generally underperformed during 
periods of rapidly rising interest rates.  
 
Regulatory risk.  MLPs are regulated across a number of industries. TLLPs crude gathering assets are 
subject to state and Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) regu lations. Increased regulations and 
standards to address safety and environmental concerns could affect an MLPs ability to grow.

Environmental incidents and terrorism.  Many MLPs have assets that have been designated by the 
Department of Homeland Security as potential terrori                    st targets, such as pipelines and storage assets. A 
terrorist attack or environmental incident could disrup  t the operations of an MLP, which could negatively 
affect cash flow and earnings in the near term. 
 
V. Valuation 
 
Valuation -- $26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on a blend of (1) our thr ee-stage distribution discount model, which assumes an 
8.5% required rate of return and a long-term growth rate   of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow 
multiple of about 15x our 2012 estimate.  
 
Discounted Distribution Model (DDM) Model 
 
Our primary valuation tool is a three-stage distribution  discount model. Our model assumes a required rate of 
return of 8.5%. For our growth estima tes, we have assumed a  five-year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, a second-
stage growth rate of 2.5%, and a pe            rpetual growth rate of 1.25%. The reduction between our second and 
perpetual growth rate assumptions reflect the fact that   eventually 50% of incrementa l cash flow at TLLP will 
accrue to the general partner.  
 
Price-To-Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) 
 
We arrived at $26 per unit for the low end of our valuation range by applying a distributable cash flow multiple 
of about 15x to our 2012 distributable cash flow estimate. TLLP currently trades a price-to-2012E DCF multiple 
of 14.3x, versus 10.4x for small-cap pipeline MLPs. Distributable cash flow is defined as the cash available to be 
distributed to limited unit holders after payments ar               e made for maintenance capital expenditure and cash 
distributions to the general partner. 
 
TLLP Versus The Small-Cap Pipeline MLP Peer Group 
 
TLLP trades at a yield of 5.5%, an enterprise value (EV)-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 13.3x, and a 
price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 14.3x. In comparison, small-cap pipeline MLPs trade at a median yield of 
6.8%, an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 10.4x, and a price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 10.4x. 
Notably, on a price-to-DCF-to-growth basis (which is akin to a PEG ratio), TLLP trades at 1.2x, versus 2.1x for 
the peer group.  
 
The drop-down model has proven to be a successful strategy, as evidenced by the premium valuations 
afforded in the market for MLPs with this business mo  del. Investors seem willing to pay a premium for the 
visibility of future growth, in our  view. MLPs that have drop-down opportunities are not reliant on third-party 
acquisitions or on finding internal organic projects to  fuel growth. While the timing of drop-down acquisitions 
is not always certain, the market is clearly ascribing a certain value to the growth visibility afforded by having a 
parent company with significant MLP-able assets, in our view. In addition, we believe there is less 
integration risk with drop-down assets than with third-party acquisitions. 
 
Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (HEP) is a good compar                     able for TLLP, in our view, given its (1) strategic 
relationship with its GP sponsor Holly Corporation (H  OC), which is an independent petroleum refiner and 
marketer (similar to TSO), (2) depe ndence on HOC for throug hput, (3) similar asset ba se (e.g., pipelines and 
terminals), (4) access to a midstream portfolio of drop-down assets, and (5) largely fee-based cash flow.

VI) Financial Overview And Model Assumptions 
 
Overview Of 2011 Estimates 
 
For 2011, we have forecasted pro forma EBITDA and DC F per unit of $52.0 million  and $1.46, respectively. 
Based on our distribution estimate of  $1.35 per unit, we forecast a coverage  ratio of 1.08x in 2011E (or excess 
cash flow of $3.4 million).  
 
Our 2011 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $12.4 million, which consists of the following: 
        o   Maintenance capex of $4.6 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        o   Growth capex of $7.8 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 79,967 bbls per day 
        o   Pipeline throughput of 51,137 bbls per day; 
        o   Trucking volume of 22,830 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 115,718 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 63,840 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls 
 
Overview Of 2012 Estimates 
 
We have assumed TLLP comp letes a $100 million acquisition at an EB ITDA multiple of 10x in Q1 2012E and 
invests $25 million in growth capex. We have forecasted EBITDA and DCF per unit of $68.1 million and $1.71, 
respectively. Based on our distribution estimate of $1.52 per unit, we forecast a coverage ratio of 1.13x in 2012E 
(or excess cash flow of $6.1 million). Our 2012 distribu tion forecast represents a 12.2% increase over our 2011 
distribution estimate. Excluding ou  r $100 million acquisition assumpti  ons, we estimate that TLLP will 
generate $58.1 million of EBITDA and DCF per unit of $1.60. 
 
Our 2012 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $131 million, which consists of the following: 
        o   Maintenance capex of $6.0 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        o   Growth capex of $25.0 million; 
        o   Assumed acquisition capex of $100 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 90,528 bbls per day 
        o   Pipeline throughput of 67,545 bbls per day  the projected 18% year-over-year increase reflects 
             the anticipated benefit of 2011-12 growth capex  and assumes no material change in pipeline 
             rates; 
        o   Trucking volumes of 22,983 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 124,192 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 68,243 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls

                                                          system. However, the partnership is evaluating expansion of its system to 
                                                          access new sources of production and make outlet connections to third party 
                                                          pipelines. Importantly, these connecti ons can be made with modest capital

Investment Thesis 

We are initiating coverage of Tesoro Logist ics LP (TLLP) with an  Outperform rating and     We are initiating coverage of 
price target of $28. TLLP is  a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp to      TLLP with an Outperform 
own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. In other words,    Rating 
TLLP was formed to be Tesoro Corps vehicle to grow its logistics infrastructure business. 
Initially, substantially all of TLLPs revenue will be derived from Tesoro, primarily under 
various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that include minimum volume 
commitments. Near term, there is visible grow th from already identified projects and future 
drop-downs or asset sales from Tesoro Corp . Longer term, we expect that TLLPs third 
party business will grow both organically and   via acquisitions. Our model assumes that 
TLLP will acquire $200 million of assets from Tesoro Corp. from 2012-2015, enabling the 
MLP to grow its distribution at a five year CAGR of 8.0%. 

TLLPs current valuation does not fully reflec t the partnerships grow th prospects and low 
risk profile, in our view. Hence, we rate the stock Outperform.  

Company Description 

Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) is a fee-based, growth oriented MLP formed by Tesoro Corp 
(TSO) to own, operate and acquire crude oil and refined products logistics assets. TLLPs 
assets consist of a crude oil gathering system  in the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin area, 
eight refined products terminals in the western United States, and a crude oil and refined 
products storage facility and five related short-haul pipelines in Utah. 

Tesoro Corp is the second largest refiner in the US with core area of operations in the 
midwestern and western United States. It owns and operates seven refineries that serve 
markets in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, 
Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Tesoro Corp trades under the symbol TSO and 
has a market cap that approximates $3.7 billion. TSO retains a significant ownership in the 
MLP as it will own about 51% of the limited partner interest and the 2.0% general partner 
interest and associated incentive distribution rights.

TLLPs assets are organized into two segments: 

    Crude Oil Gathering  will comprise approximately 48% of projected 2011 EBITDA.           High Plains System 
■
    Revenues from this segment come from TLLPs High Plains system which gathers and   Transports Bakken Oil to 
    transports crude oil from North Dakota and Montana to Tesoros Mandan refinery.          Tesoros Mandan Refinery 
    High Plains is situated within the Bakken s hale; perhaps the most exciting oil play in 
    the US today, and is well positioned for grow th. TLLP will spend approximately $6 to 
    $7 million over the next year to expand its High Plains system to accommodate 
    Tesoros announced 10,000 barrels per day expansion (to 68,000 bpd) of its Mandan 
    refinery. This project is expected to  add about $6 million to TLLPs EBITDA beginning 
    in the second quarter of 2012. In addition,  TLLP is in discussion with third parties 
    regarding expanding its system to gather their crude from the Bakken shale.

■   Terminalling, Transportation and Storage   will comprise approximately 52% of 
    projected 2011 EBITDA. TLLP owns and operates eight refined products terminals 
    that provide distribution primarily for refi ned products produced at Tesoros refineries. 
    Most of the revenues generated in this segment come from transferring refined 
    products from terminals to trucks and barges   . These terminals are located in Los 
    Angeles and Martinez, California; Salt Lak  e City, Utah; Kenai, Alaska; Anacortes, 
    Washington; and Mandan, North Dakota. Growth in this segment will be tied to 
    increases in gasoline consumption, better a  sset utilization, in part by pursuing third 
    party volumes, and pursuing small expansion projects, such as adding ethanol 
    blending capabilities at several terminals.

Bakken Shale 

The Bakken Shale play is one of the premier oil plays in North America today. This 
unconventional play extends from North Dakota and eastern Montana in the United States 
into the Canadian provinces of Saskatchew                         an and Manitoba. TLLPs focus is in the 
Bakken Shale/Williston Basin in Montana and North Dakota, the heart of the play. In 2008, 
the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated t  hat reserves in place could be as high as 
3.65 billion barrels of oil. The Bakken Shale play in North Dakota is currently the most 
actively drilled oil play in the US. Accordi                 ng to the Land Rig Newsletter, the current rig 
count is 128 (all time high was 137 in December 2010).  

Oil production has ramped to 359,589 barrels per day in March 2011, from 137,642 bpd in 
January 2008 according to the North Dakota                           Industrial Commission  (NDIC). TLLP will 
continue to evaluate opportunities to expand                         its High Plains system to accommodate 
increasing crude production from the Bakken Shale.

Valuation 

We derive our price target               of $28 for TLLP through a thr                ee-stage distribution discount 
model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, distribution CAGR of 
8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth 
rate of 1.5%. To arrive at our discount                   rate we use a blended approach combining the 
discount rate implied by the capital asset pric  ing model with the discount rate implied by 
investors assumed required rate of return (y  ield plus expected distribution growth). Our 
$28 price target implies a yield of 5.1%                    in the second quarter of 2012 (12 months out) 
based on a forecast annualized distribution of $1.43 per unit.

         U.S. TSO is the primary sh                                         ipper on TLLPs High Plains system. However, the 
         partnership is evaluating expansion of its sy  stem to access new source of production 
         and make outlet connections to third party pipelines. Importantly, these connections 
         can be made with modest capital requirements.  TLLP is also considering construction 
         of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan refinery to move crude oil in excess of the refinerys 
         needs.

■    Contractual Arrangements with Tesoro Corp Provide Stable Source of Revenue. 
     TLLP has long-term (mostly ten-year comm itments) fee-based contracts with Tesoro 
     that also provide minimum volume commitments and fees that are indexed to inflation. 

■    Potential Dropdowns from Tesoro Provide Visible Growth Opportunities.                         Tesoro

■    Third Party Business/Acquisitions Another Source for Growth.                     TLLP was formed 
     in part to facilitate the growth of Tesoros  logistics business and to potentially partner 
     with Tesoro in the pursuit of third party   acquisitions. For example, Tesoro and TLLP 
     could jointly bid on a refining  acquisition with the refinery assets acquired by Tesoro 
     and the logistics assets acquired by the MLP. 

■    Financial Flexibility.     TLLP has a strong balance sheet with just $50 million drawn 
     under a $150 million revolving credit facility. For perspective, EBITDA over the next 
     twelve months should approx imate $50 million, so debt to EBITDA is just around 1.0 
     times and well below a target leverage of              under 3.0 times. Also, the distribution 
     coverage ratio is a conservative 1.1 times. 

Challenges/Risks 

■    Tesoro accounts for nearly all of TLLPs revenues and revenues from Tesoros 
     minimum volume commitments are not sufficient to cover the minimum 
     quarterly distribution.     More than 95% of TLLPs next twelve months total revenues is 
     expected to come from Tesoro and approximately 84% of TLLPs revenues are 
     forecasted to be generated from minimum volume commitments from Tesoro. This risk 
     is mitigated by Tesoros strong base of business, financial position and majority (52%) 
     ownership of TLLP. 

■    It is hard to predict the timing of drop-downs and/or third party acquisitions.                   Our 
     model and distribution forecast assumes that TLLP will acquire $200 million of logistics 
     assets from Tesoro over the period of 2012 through 2015. Although we assume $50 
     million of annual drop-downs there is no explicit commitment from Tesoro and TLLP. 
     The timing and amount of drop-downs will impact distribution growth.              

■    Pipeline expansions in the Bakken Shale could displace trucking volumes on 
     the High Plains gathering system.           Overall increases in volumes on the High Plains 
     pipeline system is expected to more than offset potential volume declines in trucking 
     volumes. Additionally, pipeline margins ar  e higher than trucking   volumes primarily 
     because of the lower operating costs.

■   Tesoro, under certain circumstances could suspend, reduce, or terminate its 
    contractual commitments.      These events include the closure or suspension of 
    refining operations by Tesoro or a force ma jeure event that would prevent TLLP from 
    being able to meet its service obligations. 

■   Change in Taxation of Pass-through Entities.         As pass-through entities, MLPs 
    currently pay no tax at the corporate leve l. A corporate tax on MLPs would negatively 
    impact distributable cash flow across the  sector and could negatively impact TLLPs 
    ability to pay distributions. However, we vi ew MLP tax reform as unlikely, as energy 
    MLPs play a crucial role in building and maintaining US infrastructure, which in turn 
    creates U.S. jobs. 

Structure 

Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) comp leted its initial public offering (IPO) of 13 million units at 
$21 per unit in April 2011. To note, the offeri  ng was upsized from 12.5 million units, the 
underwriters over-allotment option was exer cised (1.95 million common units) and pricing 
was at the high end of the $19 to $21 filing r ange. The units were priced to yield 6.4% 
based on the minimum quarterly distribution   of $0.3375. The public owns 48.0% of the 
outstanding equity of TLLP and the balance is owned by Tesoro Corp., including the 
general partner, incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and subordinated common units.  

TLLP has the conventional IDR structure with  the general partner entitled to up to 50% of 
distribution increases if targeted distribution tiers are achieved.

Financials 

Long Term Agreements with Tesoro Provide Cash Flow Stability 

A majority (84%) of TLLPs revenues are expected to come from long-term fee-based 
contracts with Tesoro. These contracts contain minimum volume commitments and fees 
that are indexed to inflation, except for the trucking transportation services agreement. 

High Plains Pipeline  10-Year Pipeline Services Agreement 

TLLP and Tesoro have a ten-year agreement under which Tesoro is obligated to transport 
an average of at least 49,000 bpd of crude oil per month at a committed rate on TLLPs 
High Plains pipeline from North Dakota or             igin points to Tesoros Mandan refinery. 
Committed revenues on this agreement approxim ate $20 million. To note, actual volumes 
transported have historically exceeded this  minimum volume commitment and we expect 
this to be the case moving forward. In addition, the tariff rates will be adjusted annually at 
a rate equal to the percentage change consistent with the FERC indexing methodology. 

High Plains Trucking  Two Year Agreements that Renew Automatically 

Similarly, there is a two-y  ear trucking transportation serv ices agreement in place for a 
minimum of 22,000 bpd per month at a rate of $2.72 per barrel. Committed revenues on 
this agreement approximate $22 million. TLLP  expects to generate incremental revenues 
above the minimum commitment. To note, volumes that are shifted to pipeline gathering 
can reduce the trucking volume minimum obli            gation. However, TLLP realizes a higher 
margin on its pipeline gathering so financial results should not be adversely affected. The 
trucking transportation services agreement w            ill renew automatically for up to four 
successive two-year terms unless earlier terminat ed by TLLP or Tesoro with at least three 
months notice. 

Master Terminalling Services Agreem ent for Refined Products Terminals 
Aggregating 

Under this ten-year agreement, Tesoro is  obligated to an aggregate minimum throughput 
of 100,000 bpd per month at TLLPs eight               refined product terminals. The minimum 
revenue commitment approximates $29 million and fees will escalate annually by a 
percentage equal to the consumer   price index. Additionally, TLLP will charge Tesoro 
separate fees for providing ancillary serv         ices such as ethanol   blending and additive 
injection. Tesoro retains the option to renew the contract for two additional five year terms. 

Short-Haul Pipeline Transportation Services Agreement ~ $5 million Commitment 

Similarly, Tesoro and TLLP have entered into  a ten-year minimum volume commitment on 
TLLPs five Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines. Based on minimum volumes of 54,000 bpd 
and a $0.25 per tariff, the revenue commitment totals $5 million annually. As above, the 
agreement can be renewed for two additional five-year terms and the annual tariff will 
escalate with the percentage change in the consumer price index. 

Salt Lake City Storage Is Fully Contracted 

Tesoro has leased all the capacity (878,000 barrels) at TLLPs Salt Lake City storage 
facility and the existing capacity on the four pipelines connecting to Tesoros Salt Lake City 

Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP)                                                                                                                 9

refinery. The agreed upon tariff of $0.50 per barrel per month may be increased annually 
by the percentage change in the consumer pric e index (at TLLPs option). This agreement 
has an initial term of ten years and may be renewed for two additional five year terms at 
Tesoros option.  

Distribution Outlook 

We forecast a five year distribution CAGR   of 8.0%, driven by $200 million of estimated 
drop-downs ($50 million per year from 2012-15       ). We estimate t  he transactions are 
consummated at an EBITDA multiple of eight times. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 

TLLP has a strong balance sheet  with a $150 million revolving credit facility of which $50 
million has been drawn and paid to Tesoro as     part of the compensation for the assets 
contributed in the formation of the MLP. To note, Tesoro also received $280 million of the 
net proceeds from the IPO and TLLP retained ju st $5 million (primarily for working capital 
purposes and the cost for setting up the revolving credit facility). Capacity under the 
revolver can be increased to $300 million s   ubject to receiving increased commitments 
from the lenders. The loan is guaranteed by a   ll of TLLPs subsidiaries and secured by 
substantially all of TLLPs assets. The borrowing rate approximates a base rate of 3.25% 
plus a margin of about 1.5% or a Eurodolla     r rate (0.21% at April 26, 2011) plus an 
applicable margin of about 2.5%. There is a  0.50% annual commitment fee for the unused 
portion of the revolver. To note, the facility is set to mature on April 25, 2014. 

TLLPs EBITDA over the next twelve mont hs should approximate $53 million, so debt to 
EBITDA is just around 1.0 times and well below a  target leverage of under 3.0 times. Also, 
the distribution coverage ratio is a conservative 1.1 times. 

Capex 

We forecast only $10 million of growth capex in 2011 related to projects to expand 
services at certain terminals and to add c  apacity on its High Plains System. The latter 
relates to the announced expansion of Tesoros Mandan refinery. As noted, the majority of 
TLLPs distribution growth will result from $200 million in drop-down acquisitions. 

Forecast 

We forecast 2011 recurring EBITDA of $50 million, which does not assume any additional 
acquisitions for the year. We assume EBI TDA grows at ~16%  in 2012-13 and 11-12% in 
2014-15, driven by $200 million in   drop-down acquisitions. To note, we think there is 
upside to our numbers, as the market val  ue of potential drop-downs is likely $300+mn. 
There also may be upside to our growth capex  estimate of $10 million if TLLP is able to 
further expand its gathering system around t      he Bakken Shale. Finally, third party 
acquisitions may provide upside to our estimates.  

We forecast three quarters of distributable cash flow (2Q12-4Q12) of $34 million and 
distributable cash flow per LP unit of $1.     10. This compares to our declared LP 
distribution/unit estimate of $1.03, and implie s a 1.07x times coverage ratio. We assume a

The analyst(s) responsible for preparing this research report received compensation that is based upon various factors including Credit Suisse's total 
revenues, a portion of which are generated by Credit Suisse's investment banking activities. 
Analysts stock ratings are defined as follows: 
Outperform (O): The stocks total return is expected to outperform the relevant benchmark* by at least 10-15% (or more, depending on perceived 
risk) over the next 12 months. 
Neutral (N): The stocks total return is expected to be in line with the relevant benchmark* (range of ±10-15%) over the next 12 months. 
Underperform (U): The stocks total return is expected to underperform the relevant benchmark* by 10-15% or more over the next 12 months. 
*Relevant benchmark by region: As of 29th May 2009, Australia, New Zealand, U.S. and Canadian ratings are based on (1) a stocks absolute total 
return potential to its current share price and (2) the relative attractiveness of a stocks total return potential within an analysts coverage universe**, 
with Outperforms representing the most attractive, Neutrals the less attractive, and Underperforms the least attractive investment opportunities. 
Some U.S. and Canadian ratings may fall outside the absolute total return ranges defined above, depending on market conditions and industry 
factors. For Latin American, Japanese, and non-Japan Asia stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the average total return of 
the relevant country or regional benchmark; for European stocks, ratings are based on a stocks total return relative to the analyst's coverage 
universe**. For Australian and New Zealand stocks a 22% and a 12% threshold replace the 10-15% level in the Outperform and Underperform stock

**An analyst's coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector. 
Restricted (R): In certain circumstances, Credit Suisse policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, 
including an investment recommendation, during the course of Credit Suisse's engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other 
circumstances. 
Volatility Indicator [V]: A stock is defined as volatile if the stock price has moved up or down by 20% or more in a month in at least 8 of the past 24 
months or the analyst expects significant volatility going forward.  
Analysts coverage universe weightings are distinct from  analysts stock ratings a nd are based on the expected 
performance of an analysts coverage universe* versus the relevant broad market benchmark**: 
Overweight: Industry expected to outperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Market Weight: Industry expected to perform in-line with the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
Underweight: Industry expected to underperform the relevant broad market benchmark over the next 12 months. 
*An analysts coverage universe consists of all companies covered by the analyst within the relevant sector.

Hold, and Sell, respectively; however, the meanings are not the same, as our stock ratings are determined on a relative basis. (Please refer to definitions above.) An investor's 
decision to buy or sell a security should be based on investment objectives, current holdings, and other individual factors.

Price Target: (12 months) for (TLLP) 
Method: We derived our $28 price target through a three-stage distribution discount model (DDM). Our assumptions include a discount rate of 9.0%, 
distribution compounded annual growth rate of 8.0% over the next five years and 5.0% over the following five years and a terminal growth rate of 
1.5%. 
Risks: Risks to our $28 price target for TLLP are potential refinery closings which would negatively impact volumes, dependence upon TSO for the 
majority of revenue, difficulty predicting timing of drop-down acquisitions which could result in lower than expected growth, potential for interest rate 
increases, which would negatively impact interest expense at the partnership's revolving credit facility, and demand destruction and/or declining 
volumes in the areas in which TLLP operates.

performance. Information, opinions and estimates contained in this report reflect a judgement at its original date of publication by CS and are subject to change without notice. The 
price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject 
to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADRs, the 
values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. 
Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and 
assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and 
forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a 
structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. 
Some investments discussed in this report have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that 
investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment, in 
such circumstances you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make 
the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may 
prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.

Tesoro Logistics L.P.                                                                EQUITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 

Company Description 
 
Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Executive Summary 
 
TLLP is a high-quality MLP with (1) 100% fee-based       cash flow, (2) a conservative capital structure that 
provides the flexibility to pursue grow th objectives, and (3) a strong GP that is a source for organic and drop-
down acquisition opportunities, in   our view. We have forecasted a five   -year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, 
assuming average annual (1) acquisitions of $100 million and (2) growth capex of $25 million. TLLP is likely to 
trade at a premium to other small-cap pipeline MLPs, in  our view, given the following factors: (1) the fact that 
it offers investors an attractive way to participate in  the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale infrastructure, (2) 
the partnerships above-average multiyear growth outlook, and (3) TLLPs low-risk business model. We believe 
key investment highlights and considerations include the following: 
 
•   A play on infrastructure development in the Bakken shale.  Revenue from this emerging play is 
    expected to account for 53% of the partnerships tota l revenue projected for the 12 months ending March 
    31, 2012 (S-1 guidance). Several larger MLPs are investing in the Bakken Shale, but the potential upside is 
    less impactful, in our view, given th  e relative size and geographic diversity of these partnerships. We 
    anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the    Bakken to be a driver of organic growth for the 
    partnership over time. 
 
•   Visible organic growth outlook   . Excluding acquisitions, our to         tal growth capex forecast of 
    approximately $133 million in 2011-16 could support a 6.0% distribution CAGR over the next five years. 
    TLLP has earmarked $15.5 million of  growth capex over the next two years. Incremental cash flow from 
    these projects is expected to result in an 18% year-over-year increase in EBITDA for the 12 months ending 
    March 31, 2013.  
 
•   Upside could come from pote  ntial drop-down acquisitions . Our five-year distribution CAGR 
    forecast increases to 9.1% assuming $100 million of      acquisitions annually. TSO still has a sizeable 
    portfolio of logistics assets, which the partnership coul d acquire over time to augment distribution growth 
    and potentially more than double its size. TSO still owns and operates three additional terminals, two 
    pipelines, and five marine terminals outside of the partnership. 
 
•   A relatively low-risk business model and stable cash flow. TLLP derives 100% of its revenue from 
    fee-based contracts. In addition, the partnership    s stable cash flow is underpinned by ten-year 
    terminalling, transportation, and storage agreements, and ten-year minimum volume commitments for all 
    of its assets. 
 
•   Strong balance sheet.  With $50 million of debt outstanding  and $100 million available (and a $150 
    million accordion feature) on its credit facility, the partnership has the financial flexibility to pursue 
    organic growth and acquisitions, in our view.  
 
•   Customer and geographic concentration risks.  The partnership relies on TSO as the key customer 
    for all of its assets (approximately 93% of pro fo rma 2010 EBITDA) and a source for potential drop-
    downs. Consequently, the partnership is highly dependent on TSOs refining operations, midstream 
    investments, and financial position, in our view. In a ddition, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from 
    its operations in the Bakken Shale (about 53%).

Partnership Formation, Initial Public Offering, And Structure 
 
In December 2010, Tesoro Corporation (TSO) formed TL         LP to own, operate, and invest in crude oil and 
refined products logistics assets. In connection with TLLPs initial public offering (IPO), TSO contributed 
certain crude oil and refined product logistics assets to  the partnership in exchange for a 2% general partner 
(GP) interest, a 56.2% limited partner (LP) interest, an d the incentive distribution  rights (IDR). TLLP began 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 20, 20 11. Approximately 42% of the partnership was sold to 
the public via the issuance of 13 mi llion units priced at $21.00 per unit.  The overallotment of 2 million units 
was exercised in full, which increased  public unit holders LP interest to  48.0% (15 million units) from 41.8% 
and reduced TSOs LP interest to 50.0% from 56.2%.

Note: Adjusted for the exercise of the overallotment 
Source: Partnership reports 
 
Currently, there are 15.3 million common units and 15.3 million subordinated units outstanding. The latter 
class of units is all held by TSO. In total, TSO owns a limited partner (LP) interest of 50.0% and a 100% 
interest in the partnerships general partner Tesoro Lo gistics GP and the IDRs. Mana gement estimates that at 
least 80% of TLLPs annualized distribution of $1.35 per unit is tax deferred through December 31, 2013. 
 
TLLPs limited partner interest is  divided between two tranches of eq uity: common units and subordinated 
units (both 50% of total LP units). The key differences  we perceive between common and subordinated units 
are as follows: (1) subordinated units are not entitled  to receive any distributions until the common units have 
received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters during the subordination 
period and (2) subordinated units do not accrue arrearages. Typically, an MLP will fund short-term 
distribution shortfalls through its revo lving credit facility, but may opt to   halt distributions to subordinated 
unit holders if coverage is expected to fall below 1.0x for an extended period of time. Hence, subordinated units 
act as a cushion for common unit holders, providing additional distribution security.  
 
TLLPs subordinated units are eligible to convert to common units on a one-to-one basis beginning on June 
30, 2014, assuming the partnership has paid an annualized distribution of at least $1.35 per unit for three 
years. Alternatively, subordinated  units are eligible for immediate conv  ersion assuming TLLP has paid an 
annualized distribution per unit in excess of $2.025 (150.0% of the annualized minimum quarterly 
distribution) for a period of four consecutive quarters.

GP Sponsor Supports Growth From Acquisitions And Stability In Cash Flow 
 
Tesoro Corporation (TSO). TLLPs strategic relationship with its GP sponsor Tesoro Corporation enhances 
the partnerships growth prospects, in our view. TSO serv es as a strong partner to jointly pursue third-party 
acquisitions and as a source for potential drop-down ac  quisitions. TSO has a sizeable portfolio of logistics 
assets, which the partnership could acquire over time to augment distribution growth. As TLLPs largest 
customer, TSO also supports stability in the partnershi ps cash flow through its long-term transportation, 
terminalling, and storage agreements with minimum volume commitments. 
 
Management has stated its intent to use the MLP vehi     cle to build Tesoros logistics business. This could 
include potential joint bids for refining and logistics assets by TSO and TLLP.   TLLP should benefit from 
gaining exposure to deal flow that would normally be unsuitable for an MLP (e.g., package sale of refining and 
logistics assets). By pursuing acquisitions jointly,  the companies could potentially  consummate a transaction 
and divide the assets between the two entities based on   operational fit and relative risk profiles. Specifically, 
midstream properties would be more appropriate for TLLP, while retail or marketing-related businesses would 
be better suited for TSO. 
 
Tesoro Corporation is one of the leading independent refining companies in the United States. The company 
operates seven refineries primarily located in the Western United States with total refining capacity of 664,500 
barrels (bbls) per day. In addition to refining assets,   the company has a network of  880 retail stations in 15 
states that sell transportati on fuels primarily under the  Tesoro, Shell, USA Gasoline, and  Mirastar brands. 
Founded in 1968, TSO was originally  focused on the exploration and produc tion of crude oil. In 1969, TLLP 
purchased its first refinery near Kenai, Alaska. During the 1990s, TSO began to focus on its petroleum and 
marketing businesses and sold non-core assets including its exploration and production operations. From 1998 
to 2002, TSO acquired refineries in Hawaii, Washingt  on, North Dakota, Utah, and California. In 2007, the 
company acquired the Los Angeles refinery and 278    Shell-branded retail stations from Shell Oil Products. 
During this ten-year period, TSO increased its total refining capacity to 664,500 bbls per day from 72,000 bbls 
per day. The company is now the second-largest independent refiner and marketer in the United States, with 
an enterprise value of approximately $5 billion. 
 
TSOs long-term debt is currently ra ted Ba1 and BB+ by Moodys and Standa rd and Poors, respectively, with 
Stable outlooks. While TSOs debt ratings are one notch below investment grade, the companys credit metrics 
appear to be in line with those of other refiners and  its liquidity has improved significantly since the economic 
recession in 2008-09. As of Q1 2011, TSOs debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0x (versus the median of 2.2x for other 
refiners) and its net debt-to-EBITDA ra tio and debt-to-capitalization ratio we re 1.2x and 37%, respectively. As 
of March 31, 2011, the company had almost $1.7 billion of  available liquidity consisting of $742 million of cash 
and $974 million undrawn on the companys revolving credit facility.

Why Was Tesoro Logistics Partners Created? 
 
An MLP provides TSO with a number of benefits, including the following: 
 
•   A tax-advantaged structure with which to  increase Tesoros logistics assets.  Tesoro Logistics 
    Partners provides a platform for TSO to build its logi stics business and maximize the integrated value of 
    its midstream and downstream assets . In addition, an expansion of Tesoros logistics franchise should 
    enable TSO to diversify its asset base (e.g., mitigate its exposure to refining fundamentals).  
     
•   A premium valuation on midstream assets.   Historically, assets within an MLP structure have 
    traded at higher valuations in the market than those same assets would within a corporate structure. For 
    example, small-cap pipeline MLPs are currently tr     ading at a median enterprise value (EV)-to-2012 
    adjusted EBITDA multiple of 10.4x, versus 4.8x for North American refining companies.  
 
•   The opportunity to maintain control of the assets while participating in the upside potential 
    of the incentive distribution rights.  
 
•   Another financing vehicle.  TLLP provides TSO with a source of lower-cost equity with which it can 
    finance logistics-related growth. Historically, MLPs  have had good access to the capital markets, which 
    could help facilitate growth of the overall entity. 
 
Investment Highlights 
 
A Play On Infrastructure Development In The Bakken Shale 
 
TLLP offers investors an attractive way to participate  in the anticipated growth in Bakken Shale infrastructure. 
Crude oil gathering revenue from this region (i.e., the High Plains System) is expected to account for 53% of 
the partnerships total revenue projected for the 12 mont hs ending March 31, 2012 (S-1 guidance). There are 
several larger MLPs that are investing in the Bakken Shal e, but their potential upside  is less impactful, in our 
view, given the relative size and geographic diversity  of these partnerships. TLLP owns a crude oil gathering 
system tied to production from the Bakken Shale/ Williston Basin. The High Plains System includes 700 miles 
of pipeline with the capacity to de liver up to 70,000 bbls per day to TSO s Mandan, North Dakota refinery and 
trucking operations that gather about 23,000 bbls per day of crude oil from the region.  
 
We anticipate the expansion of TLLPs footprint in the  Bakken Shale to be a driver  of organic growth for the 
partnership over time. TLLP already has committed to one project (i.e., an expansion of its High Plains System 
by Q2 2012 to accommodate the capacity addition at  TSOs Mandan refinery). The partnership has identified 
other potential opportunities that   have not been incorporated in it     s S-1 guidance. At this juncture, 
management has not quantified the potential amount of investments. For modeling purposes, we have 
assumed growth capex of $25 million   annually in 2012-16, which may prove to be conservative. TLLPs 
potential projects in the Bakken Shale include the following: 
 
•   Expansion of the High Plains System through the cons truction of additional gathering lines to access new 
    drilling locations. 

•   To establish additional outlet connections between the High Plains System and third-party regional 
    pipelines, which would increase optionality for sh  ippers and capture increm ental third-party volume. 
    Management has identified five potential interconnect  ions that it believes could be accomplished with 
    minimal capital: Enbridges pipelines at Ramburg, North Dakota and Portal at the U.S./Canadian border, 
    and True Companies Bridger pipeline at Richey, Mont ana, Belle Fourche pipeline at Fritz, North Dakota, 
    and Little Missouri pipelines at Fryburg, North Dakota. 

•   Increase High Plains Systems throughput capacity with additional pumping capacity. 

•   Construction of a rail facility at TSOs Mandan refine ry to increase the Williston Basin takeaway capacity 
    for crude oil.  
 
The Bakken Shale is one of the major emerging oil plays in North America. It is a key crude oil resource with 
approximately 4.0-6.3 billion bbls of recoverable reserv es (including the underlying Three Forks formation), 
according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral       Resources. This compares  with total U.S. proved 
reserves of 19.1 billion bbls. The Bakken play is a formation in the Williston Basin, which is spread across parts 
of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Canada. Development in the Bakken Shale has accelerated given 
the favorable crude oil price environment, advancements in drilling technologies, and E&P companies focus 
on liquids-rich areas due to more fa  vorable economics. Specifically, the rig count tied to the play in North

Upside beyond organic growth could  potentially come from acquisitions.  We forecast a five-year 
distribution CAGR of 9.1% predicated on assumed acqu isitions of approximately $500 million in 2012-16 (or a 
$100 million transaction each year) completed at an EBITDA multiple of 10x and average annual growth capex 
of approximately $25 million during that period. Potential acquisitions will likely be a mix of drop-downs from 
TSO and third-party acquisitions, in our view. 
 
The actual economics of a potential drop-down will likely   be a function of the orga nic growth profile of the 
acquisition target and the maturity of  TLLP as an MLP. For example, a higher  acquisition multiple is likely for 
TSOs terminals with more volume upside due to (1) a favorable demand outlook for petroleum products in the 
region, (2) a less competitive market,  (3) access to multiple sources (refin eries), and/or (4) enhanced service 
capabilities available. In addition, as the partnerships earnings base grows and a higher percentage of 
distributions are paid to the GP, it becomes more cha      llenging to consummate accr etive acquisitions, in our 
view. Accordingly, TSO may elect to reduce drop-down multiples in the outer years to ensure that the 
transaction benefits both TLLPs GP and LP unit holders. We view TLLPs potential drop-down opportunities 
as a competitive advantage given that they provide a built-in growth platform and eliminate the need to 
compete for third-party acquisitions.

The pool of potential drop-down assets should increase        as TSO continues to invest in logistics assets. In 
addition, management intends  to use TLLP as a vehicle to pursue th  ird-party acquisitions. Accordingly, our 
distribution growth forecast could pr ove conservative if the size and/or  timing of acquisitions consummated 
exceeds expectations. To note, the assumed EBITDA of         $50 million for our acquisition forecast in 2012-16 
compares with estimated cash flow of $66-68 million   from TSOs current remaining portfolio of midstream 
assets (see pages 10-11 for details). 
 
All else being equal, we forecast th at a $50 million increase or decrease  in our assumed acquisition spending 
estimate will increase or decrease our five-year distribution CAGR by roughly 1-2%, depending on the EBITDA 
multiple assumed (i.e., lowe r multiples imply higher gr owth leverage from acquis ition spending). Figure 5 
illustrates the sensitivity of our distribution growth fore cast to varying levels of  assumed acquisition spending 
and EBITDA multiples. Key assumptions used in this analysis are as follows: 
 
•    Acquisition multiples in the range of 9-11x EBITDA.  
•    Maintenance capex of approximately 9% of EBITDA, which is in line with TLLPs guidance for the 12 
    months ending March 31, 2012. 
•    Acquisitions in 2012 financed 100% with debt given that TLLP currently has only $50 million of debt 
    outstanding. We estimate 50% debt and 50% equity  financing thereafter. Finally, we assume a long-term 
    average interest rate of 6.75% and yield of 6.25% for the equity portion of the financing.

Drop-down of TSOs remaining logistics a  ssets could double the size of TLLP.    Based on an 
acquisition multiple of 10x EBITDA, we estimate a  pproximately $660-680 million  of immediate drop-down 
potential for TLLP. Management has not disclosed the earnings generated by TSOs remaining portfolio of 
midstream assets. However, it did note that the aggregate gross book value of TSOs retained logistics assets 
was $240 million as of December 31, 2010. This compares with the gross book value of $193 million for the 
assets currently in TLLP. Assuming that the relative gross book values are proportionate to cash flow, EBITDA 
of potential drop-down assets could approximate $66        million. Alternatively, we estimate EBITDA of  
$68 million for TSOs remaining portfo lio of midstream assets based on   the assets average throughput in 
2009 and 2010, estimated market-based rates, and margins in line with TLLPs S-1 guidance. Our assumptions 
include (1) average volume in 2009 and 2010 for TS   Os pipelines and terminals and the maximum storage 
capacity; (2) a transportation rate of  $0.61 per bbl for TSOs Alaska Pipeline based on its published tariff, (3) a

Entitled to right of first offer fo r future TSO midstream divestitures.  For a period of ten years after 
its IPO, TLLP has a right of first offer to acquire certai  n logistics assets if TSO decides to sell them. Potential 
drop-down assets include three terminals, two pipelines, and five marine terminals located in Alaska, 
California, and Washington. Please refer to the Appendix (pages 38-42) for descriptions of these assets. Having 
the right of first offer on substantially all of TSO           s potential midstream divest  itures should mitigate 
competition with third parties for futu re acquisition opportunities, which we  view as a significant benefit for 
the partnership. 
 
TLLP Has A Relatively Low-Risk Business Model And Stable Cash Flow 
 
100% fee-based revenues with no direct commodity exposure.   TLLP derives 100% of its cash flow 
from fee-based, transportation, terminalling, and storag e contracts with limited volumetric risk (see pages 12-
14 for details on minimum volume commitments). Essent  ially, the partnership receives a fee per unit (bbl) 
handled by its gathering system, terminals, pipelines, and/or storage assets. It does not take title to the 
product it handles and has no direct exposure to the pric e of crude oil or refined products. Accordingly, TLLPs 
cash flow should be relatively stable, in our view.   While the partnership has no direct commodity exposure, 
changes in commodity prices can ultimately affect the partnerships volume. For example, if crude oil prices 
were to decline significantly, the development of the  Bakken Shale could slow down. Consequently, a decrease 
in producer drilling activity in the region could lower  TLLPs future gathering throughput, thereby, decreasing 
cash flow.

TLLPs 100% fee-based cash flow compares favorably   with that of other small-cap pipeline MLPs. For the 
small-cap pipeline MLP subsector, fee-based cash flow   accounts for approximately 83% of total cash flow. 
Notably, large-cap pipeline MLPs and gathering an     d processing MLPs currently obtain 82% and 55%, 
respectively, of their cash flow from fee-based operations. 
 
Long-term commercial agreements with TSO bolster stability of cash flow. TSO is the partnerships 
primary customer and accounted for 93% of TLLPs pro forma 2010 EBITDA. The company is expected to 
account for 97% of the partnerships revenue for the 12  months ending March 31, 2012, compared to 96% of 
pro forma 2010 revenue. Notably, TLLPs contracts wi  th TSO are long-term in nature. For the High Plains 
System, TLLP entered into a ten-year crude oil gath    ering and transportation agreement and a two-year 
trucking transportation services agreement with TSO, which is the primary shipper on the system. In addition, 
TLLP secured a ten-year services agreement for all eight of its terminals and ten-year transportation and 
storage contracts for its assets in Sa lt Lake City. All ten-year agreements  may be renewed for two additional 
five-year terms at TSOs option. The trucking contract  will automatically be extended for successive two-year 
terms, up to a maximum of ten years. These long-term agreements should provide the partnership with a 
reliable stream of cash flow into the future, in our view. 
 
Ten-year minimum volume commitments also  mitigate volatility of cash flow.   Unlike for many 
other midstream operators, TLLPs volumetric risk is limited through a minimum volume commitment feature 
in all of its agreements with TSO. Th is feature should mitigate the sensitiv ity of the partnerships cash flow to 
variability in throughput volume for the first ten year  s of the partnerships existence. Notably, management 
estimates that 84% of TLLPs projecte d revenue for the 12 months ending  March 31, 2012, is supported by its 
minimum volume commitments (i.e., $81.7 million out of $97.3 million). This implies that TLLPs distribution 
coverage ratio would approximate 0.73x (cash flow deficit of $11.4 million) if  the partnership realized only the 
minimum volume during that time frame and did not realize a commensurate decrease in operating expenses. 
 
For the High Plains System, TSO has agreed to transport an average of at least 49,000 bbls per day of crude oil 
per month at the committed rate (i.e., $1.11 per bbl) from North Dakota origin points to TSOs Mandan refinery 
for a period of ten years. If applicable, TSO agrees to pay TLLP a shortfall pa  yment equal to the volume 
shortfall during a calendar month, mu ltiplied by the weighted average committed tariff rate paid by TSO for 
that month. The shortfall payment is  to be credited against amounts owed by TSO in excess of its minimum 
throughput commitment during any of the succeeding three months. Any remaining portion of the shortfall 
credit expires following the three-month period.  
 
Notably, TLLPs North Dakota pipeline throughput averaged 46,004 bbls per day in 2010. According to the S-1 
filing, management believes North Dakota pipeline  volume will approximate 54,200 bbls per day for the 12 
months ending March 31, 2012, which is above the     minimum volume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 
North Dakota pipeline throughput forecast, we believ  e that actual throughput will be above the minimum 
volume commitment each year. Consequently, our model does not reflect the impact of any shortfall payment 
adjustments.

TSO and TLLPs High Plains trucking transportation                services agreement provides for a minimum volume 
commitment of 22,000 bbls per day per month and a transpor tation fee of $2.72 per bbl for two years. TLLPs 
trucking volume averaged 23,305 bbls per day in 2010. Management anticipates volume to approximate 
22,900 bbls per day for the 12 months ending Marc                   h 31, 2012, which is above the minimum volume 
commitment. We anticipate actual trucking volume in 2011-16 to exceed the minimum threshold.

For TLLPs eight refined products te rminals, TSO has agreed to an aggregate average throughput minimum of 
100,000 bbls per day, per month at an av erage terminalling fee (i.e., $0.81 per bbl) for a period of ten years. If 
applicable, TSO agrees to pay TLLP a shortfall payment  equal to the volume shortfall during a calendar month 
multiplied by the weighted average throughput fee incurred by TSO for that month. The shortfall payment is to 
be credited against amounts owed by TSO in excess of  its minimum throughput commitment during any of the 
succeeding three months. Any remaining portion of the shortfall credit expires following the three-month 
period.  
 
TLLPs 2010 refined products terminal throughput averaged 113,950 bbls per day. According to the S-1 filing, 
management believes terminal volume from TSO will approximate 105,800 bbls per day for the 12 months 
ending March 31, 2012, which is above the minimum vo lume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 total refined 
products terminal throughput foreca st, we believe that actual throughput will be above the minimum volume 
commitment each year. Consequently  , our model does not reflect the                      impact of any shortfall payment 
adjustments.

For TLLPs Salt Lake City assets, TSO has agreed to tr  ansport an average of at le ast 54,000 bbls per day, per 
month of crude oil and refined products on TLLPs five sh ort-haul pipelines at the transportation rate of $0.25 
per bbl for a ten-year period. If applicable, a volume sh ortfall payment or credit adjustment would also occur. 
In addition, TSO is committed to pay TLLP a $0.50 per bbl  per month fee based on the partnerships Salt Lake 
City storage facilitys shell capacity of 878,000 bbls                    in exchange for storage an            d transportation services 
provided between TLLPs storage facility and TSOs Salt Lake City refinery. 
 
Notably, TLLPs 2010 Salt Lake Ci  ty short-haul pipeline throughput  averaged 60,666 bbls per day in 2010. 
According to the S-1 filing, management believes pipeline volume will approximate 65,800 bbls per day for the 
12 months ending March 31, 2012, which is above th  e minimum volume commitment. Based on our 2011-16 
Salt Lake City pipeline throughput forecast, we believe that actual throughput will be above the minimum 
volume commitment each year. Consequently, our model does not reflect the impact of any shortfall payment

Annual fee escalators should offset po tential inflationary cost pressures.  The High Plains pipeline 
rate is subject to the Federal Ener                                             gy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in                                                     dexing methodology. Based on the 
formula of PPI plus 2.65%, TLLP should benefit from a 6.8% rate increase in July 2011. TLLPs terminalling 
fees and Salt Lake City transportation  and storage fees are subject to auto matic annual escalators. This should 
help mitigate the impact of potential increases in the partnerships cost structure in the future. The fees are 
adjusted annually by a percentage equal to the change in the consumer price index. Alternatively, if 
management is successful in keeping expenses level, the   annual rate increases should result in modest margin 
growth, all else being equal.  
 
Conservative Capital Structure Provides Flexibility To Pursue Growth Objectives 
 
Strong balance sheet. With only $50 million of debt outstanding  and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0x, TLLP 
has the financial flexibility to pursue organic growth in  itiatives and acquisitions, in  our view. The partnership 
has a $150 million revolving credit facility, which expire s in April 2014, with a $150 million accordion feature. 
This provides TLLP the option to me                                                    aningfully increase its borrowing ca                                               pacity in the future. TLLPs total 
liquidity of $100 million should be more than suffi                                                                           cient to finance its estimated 2011 growth capital 
expenditure of approximately $8 million. 
 
We believe that TLLP will maintain                                                 a strong balance sheet and a relatively                                                   conservative capital structure of 
50% debt and 50% equity over the long term. We foreca st that the partnership could end 2011 and 2012 with a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x and 2.6x, respectively. This                                                                         compares favorably to the median ratio of 4.0x for 
other small-cap pipeline MLPs.

For 2012, we forecast that TLLP will spend $25 million                                                                               of growth capex. Our model also incorporates a  
$100 million acquisition assumption in Q1 financed wi                                                                           th 100% debt, which we anticipate the partnership 
would term out in Q2. We forecast                                                 that the partnership could end 2012                                                  with $76 million of liquidity and a 
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6x, which compares with the maximum permitted covenant threshold of 4.0x.

TLLPs general partner has IDRs, which entitle it to re                                                                          ceive an increasing percentage of the partnerships 
distributions as the distribution per unit surpasses certai  n tiers (see Figure 12). TLLP would have to increase 
its minimum quarter distribution (MQD) by 50% to reach the high splits, or 50/50 tier.

Similar to other MLPs, TLLP has an IDR reset option   in its partnership agreement. The reset option gives 
management better control of the partne rships cost of capital over the long term and allows TLLP to better 
compete for acquisitions and/or invest in organic                 projects that would otherwise not be accretive to 
distributable cash flow when the partnership becomes dee  p in the splits, in our view. As stipulated by the 
agreement, the general partner (TSO) holds the right to reset, at higher levels, the minimum quarterly 
distribution and incentive distribution levels. The cumu             lative cash flow accruing to the GP would not be 
altered, but instead, the future cash flow stream is affected.

Specifically, the GP would receive a lower percentage of incremental cash flow at the reset (higher) MQD than 
the 50% of incremental cash flow that it would receive under the initial distribution schedule. Hence, by 
resetting the incentive distribution tiers, the MLPs cost   of equity is effectively reduced. On the basis of our 
distribution growth forecast, the partnership would reac  h the high-splits tier in Q4 2015. From this point 
forward, the GP would begin receiving 50% of the partnerships incremental cash flow. 
 
TSO holds the right to reset the MQD and incentive dist  ribution levels (without the approval of the common 
unit holders) under the following conditions: 
 
•    If there are no subordinated units outstanding, and 

•    If the general partner has received incentive distributions at the highest level, or 48%, for each of the prior 
     four consecutive fiscal quarters. 
 
The GP would receive a certain number of TLLPs co                mmon units and additional   general partner units in 
exchange for resetting the incentive distribution levels. The number of common units received would be 
based on the amount of incentive cash distributions rece  ived for the two consecutive fiscal quarters prior to 
reset.

Overview Of TLLPs Assets  
 
TLLP owns and operates crude oil and refined product logistics assets. Specifically, the partnership owns crude 
oil gathering pipelines and a truck-ba sed crude oil gathering operation ti ed to production from the Bakken 
Shale/Williston Basin (i.e., the High Plains System). The system supplies crude oil to TSOs Mandan refinery in 
North Dakota. In addition, TLLP owns  and operates eight refined product  terminals with associated storage 
facilities located primarily in the Western United States, and five short-haul pipelines and storage assets in Salt 
Lake City, Utah. TLLPs terminalling assets are primarily  tied to TSOs refinery operations and play an integral 
role in helping TSO distribute refined products to market.

We expect TLLPs Crude Oil Gathering Segment (the High Plains System) to account for a significant portion 
of the partnerships cash flow (i.e., 56% of our pro   forma 2011 EBITDA forecast). For the 12 months ending 
March 31, 2012, management expects the segment to account for approximately 53% of TLLPs total revenue. 
TSO plans to expand the capacity at its Mandan refine ry to 68,000 bbls per day from 58,000 bbls per day (i.e., 
a 17% increase in total refining capacity). Concurrently, TLLP plans to spend approximately $6-7 million of 
growth capex on its High Plains system to accommodate              the expected capacity increase by Q2 2012. Excluding 
the impact of potential acquisitions, we believe that the partnerships gathering operations in the Bakken Shale 
will be the primary driver        of growth in the near term (i.e., 58%            of 2013 estimated EBITDA (excluding 
acquisitions), versus 56% of 2011E pro forma EBITDA).

As shown in Figure 16, the High Plains System can receive crude oil at connection points with the Bridger 
pipeline (at Richey, Montana), Enbrid ges North Dakota System (at Rambur g, North Dakota), and Enbridges 
pipeline on the Canadian border (at Portal, North Dakota).  
 
TLLPs pipelines gathered an average of 50,695 bbls per day and 52,806 bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 
2009. Management estimates average pipeline volume of approximately 58,000 bbls per day for the 12 months

Trucking operations.  TLLP also utilizes trucks to gather crud  e oil from wells that are not connected to 
gathering pipelines. Local producers contact TLLP when they have crude oil  ready to be delivered onto TLLPs 
High Plains system. TLLP uses both proprietary and third-party trucks to gather crude oil from nearby wells or 
collection points and deliver onto TLLPs High Plains  system through one of the partnerships 13 proprietary 
truck unloading facilities. TLLPs trucking operation ga thered an average of 23,305 bbls per day and 22,963 
bbls per day, respectively, in 2010 and 2009. Mana        gement estimates that these trucks will gather 
approximately 22,900 bbls per day of crude oil for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.

Overview of TSOs Mandan Refinery. The Mandan Refinery began operations in 1954 and is located on 
the Missouri River near Mandan, North Dakota on approximately 950 acres. It primarily receives sweet (low 
sulfur) domestic crude oil from the Bakken Shale/Williston Basin, which is transported via TLLPs High Plains 
System. On March 21, 2011, TSO announced a $38 million project to expand the capacity at its Mandan 
refinery to 68,000 bbls per day by Q2 2012 from 58,000  bbls per day. Management has indicated that a larger 
expansion of the refinery would require significant capital requirements for major upgrades and is therefore 
unlikely in the near term. 
 
Over the past three years (i.e., 2008 -10), the Mandan refinerys average total throughput was 52,000 bbls per 
day (utilization of approximately 90%). In 2010, th e Mandan refinery processed approximately 50,800 bbls 
per day of crude oil and other feedstock. The refinerys yields include gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (e.g., 
approximately 60% of total volume), diesel fuel, and jet fuel, as well as heavy fuel oils and liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG). Turnarounds at the Mandan refinery usually occur every six years and typically last one month. 
Mandans last turnaround was completed in May 2010. To note, refineries perform turnarounds periodically to 
perform maintenance and overhaul operations. Turnarounds are also used to inspect and repair equipment.  
 
The primary markets for refined products produced at TSOs Mandan refinery include Minneapolis and St. 
Paul, Minnesota. A majority of Mandans refined products are transported east via NuStars North Refined 
Products Pipelines System, which originates at the Mand an refinery and terminates in Minneapolis. As shown 
in Figure 18, NuStars pipeline ha s multiple terminals in North Dakota and Minnesota. Only 19% of Mandans 
refined products produced are distributed through TLLPs Mandan Terminal.

Overview of the Bakken Shale.  The Bakken and Three Forks are formations in the Williston Basin, which 
spans parts of Montana, North Dako ta, South Dakota, southern Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Canada. The 
Williston Basins crude oil production in December 20  10 averaged 408,125 bbls per day (or 10.6% of total 
domestic onshore production), according to the Nort  h Dakota Pipeline Authority (NDPA). As a reminder, 
TLLPs High Plains System can deliver up to 70,000  bbls per day to TSOs Mandan refinery. Development of 
the Bakken/Three Forks is primarily concentrated in the states of North Dakota and Montana. 
 
The Bakken Shale is one of the most prolific unconventional oil plays in the United States. Favorable crude oil 
prices and advancements in horizontal drilling, frac turing, and completion technologies are prompting a 
reevaluation of earlier assessments of the plays technically recoverable reserve potential. For example, the 
United States Geological Survey (U SGS) performed a study on the Bakken  Shale in 1995 and estimated that 
only 151 million barrels of crude oil   (the midpoint of the range) were technically recoverable. In 2008, the 
USGS updated its assessment of the Bakken Shale and increased its technically recoverable reserve estimate to 
3.65 billion barrels (the midpoint of the range), which represents a nearly 25-fold increase from its previous 
forecast. Estimates of the plays recoverable reserv  es have been trending upward. The North Dakota 
Department of Mineral Resources provided a recoverable  reserve estimate of 4.0-6.3 billion barrels for North 
Dakotas Bakken and Three Forks formations based on      studies conducted in 2008 and 2010. Continental 
Resources, Inc.s (the largest prod ucer in the Bakken Shale, with 865,  000 net acres as of February 2011) 
forecast is even higher (i.e., recoverable reserves of   approximately 24 billion bbls based on todays drilling 
technologies). Notably, these figures compare to total U.S. estimated proven reserves of 19.1 billion barrels.

Since 2005, North Dakota crude oil production has increa sed at a five-year CAGR of 26%, to 306.6 Mbbls per 
day in 2010 from an average of 97.7 Mbbls per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration 
(EIA). In December 2010 (latest EIA data), the states crude oil production averaged 343.9 Mbbls per day, up 
42% year over year from 242.1 Mbbls per day. North Dakota is now the fourth-largest crude oil producing state 
in the United States, up from being the ninth largest fo ur years ago. Montanas average crude oil production in 
December 2010 of 67 Mbbls per day was essentially flat with year ago volume. The states crude oil production, 
which includes volume from other resource plays, averaged 65 Mbbls per day in 2010, versus 90 Mbbls per day 
in 2005.

Due to favorable drilling economics, the Bakken Shale is one of the most actively drilled unconventional shale 
plays in the United States. According to the Land Rig Newsletter, the rig count tied to the Bakken Shale (in 
North Dakota) has increased 130% year over year, to 128 rigs (as of May 6, 2011) from 98 rigs in the 
comparable year ago period. Continental Resources estimates that approximately 3,600 horizontal wells have 
been completed in the Bakken Shale as of February                                        2011 and expects that the current rig count could add 
2,000 horizontal wells annually. The company plans to spend $1.1 billion of growth capital in the Bakken Shale 
in 2011. As of May 12, 2011, the producers with the most rigs operating in the play included Continental 
Resources (i.e., 16 rigs), Hess Corp. (i.e., 16 rigs), Whit ing Petroleum Corp. (i.e., 12 rigs), and Petro-Hunt (i.e., 
6 rigs), according to the Land Rig Newsletter.

The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources forecasts that oil production in North Dakota could reach 
450,000-700,000 bbls per day within the  next 3-7 years. For the  U.S. portion of the Williston Basin, crude oil 
production could ramp up to 550, 000-800,000 bbls per day during the 2015  -2020 time frame, according to 
the state agency. Continental Resources has a more robust  outlook and projects that Bakken Shale production 
could reach 1 million bbls per day by 2015. Takeaway ca                                        pacity out of the Williston Basin projected for 2011 
(i.e., 653,000 bbls per day, includ  ing 418,000 bbls per day by pipeline                                               s and 235,000 bbls per day by rail) 
exceeds current production of 408,125 bbls per day. Howe ver, it appears that infrastructure bottlenecks could 
arise by 2015 if crude oil production                         increases to a level above the projec                         ted total takeaway capacity in the 
region (i.e., 1,070,000 bbls per day, including all potential pipeline and rail expansions).

TLLPs Terminalling, Transportation, And Storage Segment 
 
TLLP also operates eight refined product terminals primarily located in the Western United States, with total 
terminalling capacity of 239,000 bbls per day and storage capacity of 1,627,000 bbls. The terminals are located 
in the states of California, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah,  and Washington. In Salt Lake City, the partnership also 
owns 13 refined product and crude oi    l storage tanks with 878,000 bbls     of capacity and five short-haul 
pipelines, which serve TSOs nearby refinery. 
 
Terminals.  TLLPs  terminals provide distribution, truck load     ing, storage, inventory management, and 
blending services to its cust omers. The partnerships eight  terminals primarily receiv e refined products from 
pipelines connected to TSOs Los Angeles, Martinez, Salt Lake City, Kenai, Mandan, and Anacortes refineries. 
Revenue is generated largely from th roughput fees for delivering refine d product from TLLPs terminals to 
trucks and barges. TLLP also generates revenue from providing ancillary services such as blending, jet fuel 
filtering, and additive injections at certain terminals.

In 2010, the two terminals with the highest throughput  were Los Angeles (i.e., 35,286 bbls per day) and Salt 
Lake City (i.e., 25,457 bbls per day), which in total represented approximately 53% of TLLPs total terminalling 
throughput. Notably, the aforementioned terminals rece ive refined products directly from TSOs Los Angeles 
(refining capacity of 97,000 bbls per day) and Salt Lake City (refining capacity of 58,000 bbls per day) 
refineries, respectively. TLLPs Anch orage terminal is the largest based  on terminalling capacity (63,000 bbls 
per day or 26% of total), but its volume accounted for only 13% of TLLPs total in 2010 (utilization of 24%).

TLLPs terminals handle gasoline and gasoline blendstock s, 72% of 2010 volume, diesel fuel, 23%, and jet fuel, 
5%. As shown in Figure 25, TSO accounted for nearly all (i.e., 92%) of TLLPs terminal volume in 2010. TLLP 
expects this figure to decrease over time as a result of its efforts to secure additional third-party volume.

Los Angeles, California terminal (terminalling capacity of 48,000 bbls per day).  The Los Angeles 
Terminal was purchased by TSO in May 2007 from Shell  in connection with the acquisition of the Los Angeles 
refinery. The terminal receives gasoline and diesel from TSOs Los Angeles refinery via pipelines. Refined 
products are transported via trucks  and sold to the Los Angeles market. While there is no refined product 
storage at this facility, the Los Angeles terminal does  have 6,000 bbls of ethanol storage capacity and provides 
blending services. 
 
Stockton, California terminal (9,400 bbls per day).  TLLPs Stockton terminal is located northwest of 
San Francisco, California. The terminal receives gasoline and diesel from TSOs Golden Eagle refinery in 
Martinez, California via Kinder Morg ans SFPP Northern California pipeline. Through TLLPs two-bay truck 
loading rack, TSO distributes and sells refined products locally. The terminal has 20,000 bbls and 46,000 bbls 
of diesel and gasoline storage capacity, respectively. TLLP leases the Stockton terminal from the Port of 
Stockton under a five-year lease, which expires in 20    14 and may be renewed for   three additional five-year 
terms. 
 
Salt Lake City terminal (42,000 bbls per day).  In 2001, TSO purchased the Salt Lake City terminal in 
connection with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City re finery from BP. The terminal receives gasoline, diesel, 
and jet fuel through proprietary pipeli nes from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery. The facility has two gasoline 
storage tanks with total capacity of 17,900 bbls. Refined  products are distributed locally and regionally by TSO 
and other third parties through the terminals five-bay truck rack. Approximately 50% of products produced at 
TSOs Salt Lake Refinery are distributed through TLLPs terminal.  
 
Anchorage, Alaska terminal (63,000 bbls per day). The facility is located at the Port of Anchorage. The 
Alaska terminal receives gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel fr om TSOs Kenai refinery via the Tesoro Alaska Pipeline 
(TAPL) and from marine vessels. The terminal has a rail  rack, which has the capability to unload ten railcars 
and provides access to the Anchorage Fueling and Service Corporation (AFSC) jet fuel storage facility. The 
facility also has 883,000 bbls of storage capacity (2 51,500 bbls for gasoline, 99,000 bbls for diesel, 400,200 
bbls for jet fuel, 118,300 bbls for AvGas, and 13,800 bbls  for transmix). Refined products are distributed and 
sold locally by TSO and third parties through (1) TLLPs  two truck racks, (2) third-party barges at the Port of 
Anchorage dock, and (3) TSOs pipeline connected to AF  SCs jet fuel storage facility. Approximately 28% of 
TSOs Kenai refinerys refined products are distributed by TLLPs Anchorage terminal.  
 
Mandan, North Dakota terminal (22,500 bbls per day). The Mandan terminal is located at TSOs 950-
acre Mandan refinery and consists of a truck loading  rack. TSO acquired the Mandan refinery and associated 
terminal from BP in 2001. The Mandan  terminal handles only 19% of the refinerys total yield. The remaining 
product is distributed through NuStar s North Refined Products Pipeline  System. The Mandan terminal does 
not have refined product storage.

Vancouver, Washington terminal (19,600 bbls per day).  The facility receives gasoline and distillates 
from TSOs Anacortes refinery primar ily through the Olympic Pipeline, which is operated by BP. The Olympic 
Pipeline is connected to four refineries in Puget Sound  and transports gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to terminals 
in Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Vancouver, and Portland. The Vancouver terminal can also accept barge 
shipments from the Anacortes refinery  and third parties. The facility   has 298,000 bbls of storage capacity 
(160,000 bbls for diesel, 130,000 bbls for gasoline, and   7,400 bbls for ethanol). TSO leases the Vancouver 
terminal from the Port of Vancouver. The lease expire s in 2016 and may be rene wed for two additional ten-
year periods. 
  
Boise and Burley, Idaho terminals (34,500 bbls per day).    TLLP owns two terminals in Boise and 
Burley, Idaho, which were purchased by TSO in connection with its Salt Lake City refinery acquisition from BP 
in 2001. The Boise terminal receives gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery via 
Chevrons Northwest Pipeline, while the Burley terminal receives only gasoline and diesel. The Boise terminal 
also receives ethanol by truck. The Boise terminal includes eight storage tanks capable of holding 144,000 bbls 
of gasoline, 34,300 bbls of jet fuel, 54,000 bbls of di  esel, 21,000 bbls of ethanol,  and 1,000 bbls of transmix 
capacity. The Burley terminal also has five storag  e racks with 65,900 bbls and 81,000 bbls of diesel and 
gasoline storage capacity, respectively. Refined products are distributed from the terminals via trucks and sold 
locally by TSO. Approximately 41% of total refined prod   uct volume from TSOs Salt Lake City refinery are 
handled by TLLPs Boise and Burley terminals. 
 
Demand Growth In Tesoros Operating Footprint Is Expected To Outpace The U.S. Average 
 
According to the EIAs Annual Energy Outlook (2011)       , U.S. demand for liquid products, i.e., liquefied 
petroleum gases (LPG), motor  gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oils, petrochemical feed stocks, and other, is 
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.5% through 2035 (i.e., based on 2009-2035). Notably, in two 
of the three U.S. regions served by TS Os refineries (terminals), the growth  in regional demand is anticipated 
to exceed the average rate for the United States. The EIA estimates liquids products consumption in the Pacific 
and Mountain regions to grow at average annual rates of 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, to 6.26 quadrillion 
British thermal units (Btu) and 3.07 quadrillion Btu by  2035 (from 5.28 quadrillion Btu and 2.38 quadrillion 
Btu, respectively, in 2009). Demand in the other U.S. region (i.e., the West North Central region, served by the 
companys Salt Lake City assets and terminals in Boise an d Burley, Idaho) is expected to grow by 0.2%, to 2.76 
quadrillion Btu from 2.63 quadrillion Btu. In aggregate, demand in the domestic regions served by TSOs 
refineries is estimated to growth at an average annual rate of 0.6%.

Salt Lake City storage facility and pipelines.  TLLP owns crude oil and refined product pipelines and an 
878,000 bbl storage facility, which excl  usively support TSOs 58,000 bbls   per day Salt Lake  City refinery. 
These assets were purchased by TSO in 2001 in connection     with the acquisition of the Salt Lake City refinery 
from BP. TLLPs logistics assets facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products into and out of TSOs 
Salt Lake City refinery. Approximately 41% of the refine  rys yield is distributed vi a a third-party pipeline to 
TLLPs Burley and Boise Terminals. Further details of TLLPs Salt Lake City assets follow: 
 

•   Crude oil and refined product storage.  TLLP owns 13 crude oil and  refined product storage tanks 
    with total shell capacity of 878,000  bbls. The storage tanks are connected  to TSOs Salt Lake City refinery 
    though four proprietary pipelines. The crude oil storage tanks supply the Salt Lake City refinery, while the 
    refined product storage tanks store the refinerys product yield including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. 

•   Crude oil pipelines.  TLLP owns three crude oil pipelines (8, 10, and 16 inches), which are each 
    approximately two miles long. These pipelines transpor t crude oil from a Chevron  interstate pipeline and 
    Plains All Americans Pacific crude oil pipeline to T LLPs storage facility. Approximately 79% of the Salt 
    Lake City refinerys crude oil feedstock is delivered by TLLPs short-haul crude oil pipelines.  

•   Refined product pipelines.   TLLP also has two (6 and 8 inch)            refined product pipelines, which 
    transport gasoline and diesel three miles from TSOs refinery to Chevrons Northwest Pipeline.  
In 2010, TLLPs Salt Lake City pipe   line throughput averaged 60,666 bbls per day, versus an average of  
62,822 bbls per day in 2009, and the three-year averag  e of 64,126 bbls per day.  Management estimates an 
average throughput of 65,800 bbls per day for the 12 months ending March 31, 2012.

Risks Specific To TLLP 
 
Customer concentration.  In 2010, TSO accounted for 96% of TLLPs total revenue and 92% of the 
partnerships terminalling throughput. Thus, a disruption  to TSOs refinery operations and/or a change in 
TSOs financial position could negatively affect the partnerships cash flow and future growth.

•   Slower-than-forecast drop-downs from TSO.   TLLPs distribution grow th prospects are highly 
    dependent on acquisitions from its GP  sponsor, in our view. If there is a delay in the drop-down of assets 
    to the partnership, TLLPs ability to grow could be slower than forecasted. 
 
•   Geographic concentration in Bakken Shale. Currently, a majority of TLLPs revenue is derived from 
    its operations in the Bakken Shale region. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2012, TLLPs crude oil 
    gathering system in the Bakken Shale is expected to   account for 53% of total revenue. If TSOs Mandan 
    refinery were to experience any disruptions for a pr  olonged period of time, th is could have a negative 
    impact on the partnerships primary source of revenue. 
 
•   Lower refining margin.  A decrease in TSOs refining margin could materially affect the amount of 
    crude oil and refined products handle d by TLLP. Margin could deteriorate if crude oil (feedstock) prices 
    increase and/or refined product pr ices decrease due to lower demand   (i.e., economic weakness, high 
    unemployment, inventory levels, etc.). Weak refining margin could cause TSO to reduce refined product 
    production at its refineries, which could result in lower throughput volume for the MLPs assets. 
 
•   Declining production. The partnerships crude oil gathering volume is dependent on the production 
    profiles of the Bakken Shale. Lower-than-expected pr  oduction volume, inability to secure incremental 
    volume to offset declining wells, or a decline in drilling activity due to lower crude oil prices or rising costs 
    could negatively affect future earnings and cash flow. 
 
•   Lower commodity prices.  While TLLP currently has no direct co mmodity price risk, a majority of its 
    revenue is tied to the exploration and production operations of producers in the Bakken Shale. Lower 
    crude oil prices could have the potential to dramatically decrease producers drilling activity and 
    consequently, the partnerships throughput volume.

Risks Applicable To All Energy MLPs 
 
•    Legislative risk. The potential for U.S. tax reform, which coul d result in the corporate taxation of pass-
    through entities, is a risk for MLPs. Discussion around  carried interest, derivative legislation, and cap and 
    trade could also result in headline legislative risk.  
 
•    Access to capital markets. MLPs are dependent on debt and equity markets to finance growth projects 
    and acquisitions. A dislocation in either of these mark ets could reduce a partnerships ability to increase 
    distributions, as investments would become more expensive on the margin. 
 
•    A severe economic downturn. Energy demand is closely linked to             overall economic growth. A severe 
    economic downturn could reduce th e demand for energy and commodity  products, which could result in 
    lower earnings and cash flow. 
 
•    Interest rate risk. As evidenced from the period 1998-99, MLPs have generally underperformed during 
    periods of rapidly rising interest rates.  
 
•    Regulatory risk. MLPs are regulated across a number of industries. TLLPs crude gathering assets are 
    subject to state and Federal Energy Regulatory Co  mmission (FERC) regulation s. Increased regulations 
    and standards to address safety and environmental concerns could affect an MLPs ability to grow.  
 
•    Environmental incidents and terrorism.  Many MLPs have assets that have been designated by the 
    Department of Homeland Security as potential terrori st targets, such as pipe lines and storage assets. A 
    terrorist attack or environmental incident could disrupt the operations of an MLP, which could negatively 
    affect cash flow and earnings in the near term. 
 
Valuation 
 
Valuation--$26-28 Per Unit 
 
Our valuation range is based on a blend of (1) our thr ee-stage distribution discount model, which assumes an 
8.5% required rate of return and a long-term growth rate  of 1.25%, and (2) a price-to-distributable cash flow 
multiple of about 15x our 2012 estimate.  
 
Discounted Distribution Model (DDM) Model 
 
Our primary valuation tool is a three-stage distribution  discount model. Our model assumes a required rate of 
return of 8.5%. For our growth estima tes, we have assumed a  five-year distribution CAGR of 9.1%, a second-
stage growth rate of 2.5%, and a pe     rpetual growth rate of 1.25%. The reduction between our second and 
perpetual growth rate assumptions reflect the fact that  eventually 50% of incrementa l cash flow at TLLP will 
accrue to the general partner.

Price-To-Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) 
 
We arrived at $26 per unit for the low end of our valuation range by applying a distributable cash flow multiple 
of about 15x to our 2012 distributable cash flow estimate. TLLP currently trades a price-to-2012E DCF multiple 
of 14.3x, versus 10.4x for small-cap pipeline MLPs. Distributable cash flow is defined as the cash available to be 
distributed to limited unit holders after payments ar              e made for maintenance capital expenditure and cash 
distributions to the general partner. 
 
TLLP Versus The Small-Cap Pipeline MLP Peer Group 
 
TLLP trades at a yield of 5.5%, an enterprise value (EV)-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 13.3x, and a 
price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 14.3x. In comparison, small-cap pipeline MLPs trade at a median yield of 
6.8%, an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA (2012E) multiple of 10.4x, and a price-to-DCF (2012E) multiple of 10.4x. 
Notably, on a price-to-DCF-to-growth basis (which is akin to a PEG ratio), TLLP trades at 1.2x, versus 2.1x for 
the peer group.  
 
The drop-down model has proven to be a successful strategy, as evidenced by the premium valuations 
afforded in the market for MLPs with this business mo  del. Investors seem willing to pay a premium for the 
visibility of future growth, in our  view. MLPs that have drop-down opportunities are not reliant on third-party 
acquisitions or on finding internal organic projects to  fuel growth. While the timing of drop-down acquisitions 
is not always certain, the market is clearly ascribing a certain value to the growth visibility afforded by having a 
parent company with significant MLP-able assets, in our view. In addition, we believe there is less 
integration risk with drop-down assets than with third-party acquisitions. 
 
Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (HEP) is a good compar                    able for TLLP, in our view, given its (1) strategic 
relationship with its GP sponsor Holly Corporation (H  OC), which is an independent petroleum refiner and 
marketer (similar to TSO), (2) depe ndence on HOC for throug hput, (3) similar asset ba se (e.g., pipelines and 
terminals), (4) access to a midstream portfolio of drop-down assets, and (5) largely fee-based cash flow.

EV-to-EBITDA definition. When comparing TLLPs value on a basi s of its EV-to-EBITDA multiple, we use 
an adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA generated by the partnershi p is used to support the cash distributions to both 
the limited and general partners. However, enterprise valu e reflects only the interest of the limited partners. 
Therefore, in order to produce an apples-to-apples comparison, we deduct the cash flow accruing to the 
general partners from EBITDA. For example, if a part nership is generating EBITDA of $100 million and $10 
million is accruing to the general partner, we dedu              ct $10 million from EBITDA   in calculating our EV-to-
EBITDA multiple. We believe this is the most appropriate way to adjust EBITDA when comparing it to 
enterprise value. 
 
Projected Yield As A Check 
 
While we rely on a dividend discount model and cash fl  ow multiples as our primary valuation tools, we also 
look at yield as a gut check to our other valuation esti mates. In general, we tend to examine our distribution 
forecast several years out and evaluate whether, based   on our valuation range, the projected yield could be 
reasonable.

Looking out one year and assuming that TLLPs yield      was in a range of 5-7%, TLLP units could be worth  
$21-30 per unit, with 14% downside risk to 21% upside potential from the current market price. The potential 
flaw in this analysis is that our distribution estimates  could be inaccurate (both to the upside potential and the 
downside risk), as the timing and magnitude of potential acquisitions is unknown. 
 
Financial Overview And Model Assumptions 
 
Overview Of 2011 Estimates 
 
For 2011, we have forecasted pro forma EBITDA and DC  F per unit of $52.0 million  and $1.46, respectively. 
Based on our distribution estimate of  $1.35 per unit, we forecast a coverage  ratio of 1.08x in 2011E (or excess 
cash flow of $3.4 million).  
 
Our 2011 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•   Total capex spending of $12.4 million, which consists of the following: 
        Maintenance capex of $4.6 million (9% of EBITDA); 
        Growth capex of $7.8 million; 
•   Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 79,967 bbls per day 
        Pipeline throughput of 51,137 bbls per day; 
        Trucking volume of 22,830 bbls per day: 
•   Average refined products terminalled of 115,718 bbls per day 
•   Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 63,840 bbls per day 
•   Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls 
 
TLLP provided Q1 2012 trailing-12-months (TTM) guid ance in its prospectus. The company forecasts EBITDA 
of $52.9 million, which is in line with our forecast of $52.7 million (excluding assumed acquisitions). Figure 33 
compares our Q1 2012 TTM estimates to TLLPs guidance.

Overview Of 2012 Estimates 
 
We have assumed TLLP comp letes a $100 million acquisition at an EB ITDA multiple of 10x in Q1 2012E and 
invests $25 million in growth capex. We have forecasted EBITDA and DCF per unit of $68.1 million and $1.71, 
respectively. Based on our distribution estimate of $1.52 per unit, we forecast a coverage ratio of 1.13x in 2012E 
(or excess cash flow of $6.1 million). Our 2012 distribu tion forecast represents a 12.2% increase over our 2011 
distribution estimate. Excluding ou  r $100 million acquisition assumpti                               ons, we estimate that TLLP will 
generate $58.1 million of EBITDA and DCF per unit of $1.60. 
 
Our 2012 estimates are based on the following: 
 
•    Total capex spending of $131 million, which consists of the following: 
           Maintenance capex of $6.0 million (9% of EBITDA); 
           Growth capex of $25.0 million; 
           Assumed acquisition capex of $100 million; 
•    Average High Plains System (crude oil gathering) throughput of 90,528 bbls per day 
           Pipeline throughput of 67,545 bbls per day  the pr  ojected 18% year-over-year increase reflects the 
            anticipated benefit of 2011-12 growth capex and assumes no material change in pipeline rates; 
           Trucking volumes of 22,983 bbls per day: 
•    Average refined products terminalled of 124,192 bbls per day 
•    Average Salt Lake City short-haul pipelines throughput of 68,243 bbls per day 
•    Salt Lake City storage capacity reserved of 878,000 bbls

Overview Of TSOs Portfolio Of Potential Drop-Downs 
 
Following the close of TLLPs initial pu blic offering, TSO still holds a portfolio of logistics assets that it could 
potentially sell to the partnership over time. Approximatel y 45% of TSOs logistics assets (based on book value 
as of December 31, 2010) were contributed in the fo  rmation of the partnership. TSOs remaining logistics 
assets, i.e., TLLP has a right of first offer (ROFO) to acquire, include three product terminals, two pipeline 
systems, and five marine terminals. Similar to TLLPs current asset base, these assets are tied to TSOs refining 
operations (i.e., Anacortes, Kenai, Los Angeles, and Martinez refineries). Notably, TSOs Rocky Mountain 
trucking operation and Hawaii logistics assets (i.e., mooring facility, pipeline, and neighboring refined product 
facilities) are not included in the partnerships ROFO agreement. This is largely due to the less stable cash flow 
profile of the assets.

We anticipate that the initial drop-down could include a TSO refined products terminal or a pipeline given the 
similarity of these facilities to TLLPs existing asset base. Notably, management has indicated that some 
potential drop-down assets could have meaningful additional capex requirements, which would likely preclude 
the MLP from a near-term drop-down. For example, management believes the Golden Eagle Wharf will 
require a significant amount of ca  pex to maintain compliance with     numerous government mandates. 
Management estimates that initial capex investments could exceed $100 million. Thus, we believe that TSO 
would refrain from initially dropping-down the Golden Eagle Wharf and other similar assets that require a 
significant amount of capital investme nts. We expect TSO to hold and develop these assets until they become 
MLP-suitable (i.e., stable, fee-based cash flow). Figure 40 provides an overview of assets which could be sold to 
the partnership over time.

TSOs Refining Operations 
 
Tesoro Corporation is the second-lar gest independent refiner and marketer in the United States and employs 
approximately 5,300 full-time employees. TSO owns seven refineries primarily in the Western United States, 
with total refining capacity of 664,500 bbls per day.                In 2010, TSOs total refining yield was approximately 
509,000 bbls per day and consisted of                gasoline and gasoline blendstocks,   46%, heavy oils and residual 
products, 21%, diesel fuel, 20%, and jet fuel, 13%.  
 
TLLPs logistics assets play an integral role in TSOs              refinery operations. TLLPs assets supply the refineries 
with feedstock and distribute TSOs re fined products to other third parties  and end users. As shown in Figure 
41, TLLP transports 79% and 100% of refinery feedstock to TSOs Salt Lake City and Mandan refineries, 
respectively. TLLPs terminal assets   store or distribute refined products for six of TSOs seven refineries. 
Currently, TLLP does not handle any crude oil or refined product volume for TSOs refinery in Hawaii.

Overview of Tesoros Refineries 
 
Los Angeles, California refinery.  TSOs Los Angeles refinery is loca ted on 300 acres approximately 20 
miles south of Los Angeles. It curre  ntly has a crude oil capacity of 97,000 bbls per day and processed an 
average of 98,800 bbls per day of crude oil and other feed stocks in 2010. TSOs Los Angeles refinery primarily 
produces California Air Resources Board (CARB) gasoline, CARB diesel fuel, conventional gasoline, diesel fuel, 
and jet fuel. The refinery also has the capability to pr oduce heavy fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and 
petroleum coke.  
 
The Los Angeles refinery receives crude oil from (1) TSOs leased marine terminal at the Port of Long Beach 
and (2) third-party pipelines, whic h transport domestic crude from th e San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles 
Basin. Approximately 33% of total refined products prod uced from the refinery are distributed via TLLPs Los 
Angeles terminal. The remainder is transported through third-party refined product pipelines and terminals to 
end users in Southern California, Ariz ona, and Nevada. Notably, a small amount of refined products produced 
from the refinery is shipped to international markets from TSOs Long Beach marine dock.  
 
Martinez, California (Golden Eagle) refinery. The refinery is located approximately 30 miles northeast 
of San Francisco on 2,200 acres in Ma rtinez, California. It is TSOs larg est refinery, with 166,000 bbls per day 
of refining capacity. In 2010, the Ma rtinez refinery processed an averag e of 124,000 bbls per day of crude oil 
and other feedstock. It produces transportation fuels including CARB gasoline, CARB diesel fuel, conventional 
gasoline, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and petroleum coke.  
 
The Martinez refinery receives crude oil from numerous  proprietary and third-party assets. It receives foreign, 
Alaskan, and California crude oil through its two mari  ne terminals, which have access to the San Francisco 
Bay, and third-party pipelines. Martinezs refined pr  oducts are distributed through TSOs two marine and 
refined products terminals, TLLPs Stockton terminal,   and third-party terminals.  Notably, only 6% of the 
Martinez refinerys refined products are distributed through TLLPs Stockton terminal.  
 
Salt Lake City, Utah refinery. TSOs 150-acre Salt Lake City refinery has a refining capacity of 58,000 bbls 
per day. In 2010, the refinery processed an average of 50,100 bbls per day of crude oil and other feedstock. The 
refinery produces transportation fuels (i.e., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel), heavy fuel oils, and LPG.  
 
The refinerys feedstock includes crude oil produced in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Canada. Crude is 
transported to TSOs refinery through Plains All Amer     icans Pacific and Chevrons interstate pipelines. 
Notably, these are the only two crude oil pipelines that  serve Salt Lake City, which has five refineries with 
approximately 190,000 bbls per day of re  fining capacity. In addition to th  ird-party pipelines, the refinery 
receives crude oil through a proprietary Rocky Mounta    in crude oil trucking busi ness. TSO distributes the 
refinerys product to Utah, Idaho, and eastern Washington through TLLP-owned and third-party terminals. 
Notably, TLLPs Boise and Burley terminals receive th  eir refined product volume primarily from TSOs Salt 
Lake City refinery via Chevrons Northwest Refined Prod uct Pipeline. In addition, TLLP owns 878,000 bbls of 
storage capacity and five short-haul pipelines adjacent to TSOs Salt Lake City refinery that transport crude oil 
and refined products to and from the refinery.   
 
Kenai, Alaska refinery.  The Kenai Refinery is located 60 miles  southwest of Anchorage in Kenai, Alaska. 
The Kenai refinery has a current capacity of 72,000 bbls per day and processed 53,400 bbls per day of crude oil 
and other feedstock in 2010. The refinery primarily sour  ces its crude oil from Alaska, but also uses foreign 
crude as feedstock. The Kenai refinery primarily produces gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel, diesel fuel, 
heating oil, heavy fuel oils, LPG, and asphalt.   
 
Located on the Cook Inlet, TSOs Kenai refinery receives crude oil from TSOs proprietary marine terminal, a 
third-party pipeline, trucks, and TSOs 24-mile pipeline, wh ich is connected to the Cook Inlet oil field. Refined 
products are transported through TSOs TAPL pipeline to TLLPs Anchorage terminal and the Anchorage 
International Airport. Refined products are also distributed through TSOs Kenai marine terminal and the Port 
of Anchorage. Approximately 28% of Kenais refined products are delivered to TLLPs Anchorage Terminal.  
 
Mandan, North Dakota refinery. For details on TSOs Mandan Refinery, please refer to page 20. 
 
Anacortes, Washington refinery. The Anacortes refinery is located on  the Puget Sound, 70 miles north of 
Seattle, Washington. The refinery has total processing capacity of 120,000 bbls per day. Notably, the Anacortes 
refinerys naphtha hydrotreater was involved in a fire on April 2, 2010. The refinery was temporarily shut down 
to repair the unit. In November 2010, TSOs Anacortes    refinery resumed operations at planned rates. As a 
result of the fire and subsequent down-time, the Anacortes refinery processed an average of 39,300 bbls per 
day in 2010. The refinery produces gasoline (including CARB gasoline), diesel fuel, jet fuel, heavy fuel oils, 
LPG, and asphalt.

The Anacortes refinery receives most of its crude oil from Kinder Morgans Trans Mountain Pipeline (i.e., 
Canadian crude) and TSOs marine te rminal located at the refinery. Kinder Morgans Trans Mountain is a  
715-mile pipeline, which imports crude oil and refined pr oducts from Edmonton to Puget Sound. The pipeline 
services numerous refineries in the area and has an operating capacity of 300 Mbbls per day. The Anacortes 
refinery distributes refined product via (1) a third-party refined product pipeline, (2) TLLPs Vancouver 
terminal, and (3) TSOs marine terminal to markets in Washington, Portland, the West Coast, and Pacific Rim. 
Approximately 21% of the refinerys refined products are distributed through TLLPs Vancouver Terminal.  
 
West Coast Crack Spreads Have Historically Been At A Premium To The Gulf Coast Spread 
 
Since 2000, the West Coast crack spread (based on  Bloombergs Alaskan North Slope (ANS) Crude Oil 3-2-1 
Crack Spread/U.S. West Coast) has averaged $16.51 per  bbl. The spread has averaged $18.48 per bbl year to 
date and is currently at $13.12 per bbl. Typically, crack spreads widen in to the summer driving season due to 
increased demand. 
 
Notably, the historical West Coast crack spread represents a 117% premium to the average Gulf Coast spread of 
$7.59 per bbl (as measured by Bloombergs WTI Cushing Crude Oil 3-2-1 Crack Spread/U.S. Gulf Coast). The 
variance is even greater when comparing the West Coas t crack spread with the Gulf Coast assuming Louisiana 
light sweet (LLS) crude oil as the feedstock for the latter (i.e., 179% higher than the historical average of $5.93 
per bbl). The current and average year-to-date West Coast crack spreads of $13.12 per bbl and $18.48 per bbl, 
respectively, are significantly above the comparable Gu lf Coast-LLS crack spreads of $6.12 per bbl and $5.27 
per bbl.

                                              Investment Considerations 

                                               
                                              Exposure to Highly Desirable Bakken Infrastructure. TLLP’s High Plains system 
                                              connects the Bakken/Williston oil-producing area to Tesoro’s Mandan refinery—the 
                                              closest refinery to the Bakken oil fields. We believe that Mandan is one of the lowest-cost 
                                              options for Williston basin producers to get crude oil to market. While High Plains has 
                                              historically delivered volumes exclusively to the refinery, the intention now is to open it up 
                                              to third parties via connections to five different transportation pipelines. This should result 
                                              in higher utilization of the gathering system and allow for increased gathering activity as 
                                              drilling grows. We believe TLLP (through the High Plains system) provides unitholders 
                                              with the opportunity to invest in a scalable, profitable crude gathering system in one of the 
                                              fastest growing oil plays in the US. 
                                               
                                              Attractive Organic Growth Prospects. The purpose of separating TLLP from TSO was 
                                              to create an independent entity that exists to maximize the value of TSO’s midstream 
                                              assets. The asset base was historically utilized exclusively by its parent company. We 
                                              believe there is ample opportunity to increase utilization by allowing third parties access to 
                                              the assets. In addition, the company has already announced several small, highly 
                                              accretive growth projects designed to provide incremental services to the expanded 
                                              customer base. We anticipate these accretive projects to continue as TLLP establishes 
                                              itself as a new, independent entity. 
                                               
                                              Ample Dropdown Growth Available from Tesoro. TLLP’s relationship with Tesoro 
                                              Corp. (TSO) should provide opportunities for dropdown asset acquisitions. TLLP has 
                                              rights of first refusal on ten TSO assets should the parent decide to sell, transfer or 
                                              dispose of the assets. We estimate the potential dollar amount of growth projects from 
                                              TSO to be approximately $600-800M. We believe dropdowns from the parent will provide 
                                              the opportunity to grow TLLP substantially over time. We estimate that each $100M of 
                                              acquisitions completed by TLLP will result in approximately 6% DCFPU accretion 
                                              (assuming a 10x EBITDA multiple). As a result of the ownership of the general partner, 
                                              TSO has the incentive to promote growth at TLLP. TSO will receive an increasing 
                                              percentage of incremental distributions paid by TLLP as the MLP grows. Therefore, we 
                                              feel TLLP will benefit greatly from dropdown growth.   
                                               
                                              Low Financial Leverage Provides Flexibility to Acquire.  TLLP has relatively low 
                                              financial leverage with an estimated debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3x. Total debt outstanding 
                                              post-IPO is $50M and is being carried on the company’s $150M revolving credit facility. 
                                              This financial flexibility offers TLLP the opportunity to acquire assets and grow 
                                              distributable cash flow. We estimate that the first $200M of acquisitions can be completed 
                                              without issuing additional equity. That would leave the debt/EBITDA ratio at approximately 
                                              3.5x. 
                                               
                                              100% Fee-Based Cash Flows Backed by Long-Term Contracts. TLLP generates 100% 
                                              fee-based cash flows. The majority are backed by 10-year contracts with minimum volume 
                                              commitments. These contracts effectively remove cyclicality of the refining business from 
                                              TLLP’s cash flows. We believe that the long-term fee-based nature of TLLP’s business 
                                              model provides the stability and transparency necessary to pay consistent distributions.   
                                               
                                              Tariff Escalation: Interstate crude oil pipelines that are not located near competing 
                                              pipelines receive a FERC-regulated “indexed” tariff to mitigate market power. That tariff 
                                              increases or decreases based on the Producer Price Index (PPI; finished goods) plus an 
                                              escalator derived by the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). For the five 
                                              years ended June 30, 2011, the escalator is +1.3%. For example, in 2010, the projected 
                                              PPI is 4.28%. Add the 1.3% escalator and we get 5.58%. Indexed tariffs increase by 
                                              5.58% starting July 1, 2010. In addition, the FERC has recently finished its new five-year 
                                              review of the escalator and will implement PPI + 2.65% for the five years ended June 30,

2016. Even in an environment of slow economic growth and inflation (assume the PPI 
increases 2% in 2011), we will have mid-single-digit annual tariff increases on the High 
Plains system. 
 
Downside Protection from Unit Subordination: TLLP’s subordination structure provides 
some downside protection to common unitholders in the event that the company is unable 
to pay its minimum quarterly distribution (MQD). It also provides management an incentive 
to achieve stated financial goals. Approximately 49% of TLLP’s total units outstanding are 
subordinated. The 15.3M subordinated units are owned by TSO. In the case that TLLP is 
unable to pay the MQD of $0.3375 per quarter on all outstanding units, common units 
have the right to receive distributions of $0.3375 plus any arrearages before any 
payments may be made on the subordinated units. In addition, the subordination period 
will end (and the subordinated units will convert to common units), when a certain set of 
financial goals is achieved related to distribution payment and growth.  
 

Investment Risks 

 
Tesoro Credit and Concentration Risk.  TLLP’s current business model is heavily tied to 
Tesoro. Historically, TSO has been the only customer for TLLP’s assets and it will 
continue to contribute the majority of its cash flows into the future. We are confident that 
TLLP will expand its customer base to include third parties over time, but TSO will always 
play an important role in TLLP’s success. TLLP enjoys minimum volume commitments on 
the 10-year contracts it has with TSO which insulate it from the ups and downs of the 
refining business cycle. However, if TSO becomes insolvent for any reason, TLLP will be 
exposed. 
 
Refined Product Demand. The recent rise in crude oil prices has resulted in high profit 
margins for producers in the Williston basin. However, it has also resulted in higher 
gasoline and other refined product prices. Should crude oil and refined product prices 
continue to rise, this may lead to a demand response. In other words, it may erode refined 
product demand. TLLP’s infrastructure was built to support Tesoro’s refineries. Should 
demand for refined products decline, utilization of TLLP’s assets may fall. TLLP’s long-
term contracts with Tesoro serve to insulate the MLP’s cash flow from the refining cycle, 
but are contingent upon TSO refineries not being shuttered for 12 consecutive months. 
 
FERC Regulatory Risk: A large portion of TLLP’s cash flow is regulated by the FERC. 
For the most part, the FERC is a benign regulator that allows an attractive return, in our 
view. However, there is always the risk that comes along with a powerful regulatory body 
being responsible for ensuring “just and reasonable” rates. 
 

Interest Rates: The entire MLP group is vulnerable to potential increases in interest rates 
in two ways. First, MLPs rely on being able to secure capital at attractive rates in order to 
grow. Since MLPs typically pay out the vast majority of their cash flow, every new large 
organic growth project or acquisition requires capital raising in the form of both debt and 
equity to maintain target leverage ratios. Therefore, if interest rates rise, an MLP’s cost of 
debt rises, decreasing cash flow. Second, as interest rates rise, competing yield-based 
investments (such as municipal bonds) may depreciate in value causing yields to rise. 
This may make alternatives to MLPs relatively more attractive and result in lower 
valuations for MLPs.

                                             Growth Drivers 
                                             Bakken Production Growth 
                                             Bakken oil production growth leads to increasing transportation volumes on the High 
                                             Plains system. We believe Bakken production will increase dramatically over the next five 
                                             years (the PIRA Energy group forecasts nearly 40% crude production from 2012 to 2014). 
                                             Enbridge Energy Partners (EEP) forecasts production for 600,000 bpd in 2014, above the 
                                             current 350,000 bpd. There are currently 180 rigs drilling in the Bakken/Williston (as of 
                                             March 2011). 
                                              
                                             Accretive Organic Growth 
                                             TLLP has announced organic growth projects on the High Plains system in conjunction 
                                             with Tesoro’s Mandan refinery expansion that we anticipate to become accretive to 
                                             earnings beginning in 2Q12 and will boost High Plains volumes by nearly 10,000bpd.  
                                             TLLP has also announced organic growth capital spending of approximately $6.8M 
                                             relating to the expansion of services and capacity in the Terminalling, Transportation and 
                                             Storage segment that we estimate will come online later in 2011. 
                                              
                                             We anticipate TLLP’s early growth projects to be highly accretive. Management forecasts 
                                             these announced growth projects to have EBITDA multiples of 1.0-2.0x, which we believe 
                                             will significantly add to DCFPU. We also believe there are numerous existing bolt-on 
                                             expansion projects available (such as increasing capacity on the High Plains system to 
                                             interconnect with other pipelines) that will be highly accretive. 
                                              
                                             Anticipated Dropdown Acquisitions from TSO  
                                             Tesoro has granted TLLP the right of first refusal for 10 assets that we believe will 
                                             eventually be sold to the partnership. We currently forecast a $100M dropdown acquisition 
                                             in both 2012 and 2013 and believe the acquisitions will provide an accretive avenue for 
                                             growth for years to come. We project that each $100M acquisition will generate 
                                             approximately 6% accretion to DCFPU assuming the deals are done at 10x EBITDA, with 
                                             potential upside if TLLP were able to increase the total percentage of capacity utilized. We 
                                             currently estimate the total amount of assets available to be $600-800M, and believe that 
                                             TLLP will utilize this strategy to achieve outsized distribution growth.

                                                 Balance Sheet, Leverage and Liquidity:  Poised for Growth 
                                                 TLLP has a solid balance sheet with a low level of financial leverage, and plenty of 
                                                 liquidity. Total debt as of the IPO was $50M and is carried on the revolving credit facility. 
                                                 Should interest rates rise, TLLP’s longer-term funding may be impacted as they have not 
                                                 locked into fixed rate, long-term debt.  Management has suggested that as growth 
                                                 continues, long-term debt will be used to maintain flexibility in the credit facility. 
                                                  
                                                 Debt/EBITDA (total debt as of the IPO divided by 2011 expected EBITDA) stands at 1.3x, 
                                                 with EBITDA/interest expense (2011 expected EBITDA/2011 expected interest expense) 
                                                 at 18.5x. Both metrics are substantially stronger than most MLP peers under

                                                 TLLP has approximately $100M available under its $150M credit facility. The relatively

Long Beach Marine Terminal                       Our price target of $Long Beach, CA30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM98,800 BPD). 
                                                 The assumptions underlying this price target are stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, 
                                                 stage two (years 3- 5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 
                                                 8.0%. The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015. The price 
                                                 target implies a total return of 30% over the next 12-18 months (including the anticipated 
                                                 2011-2012 distribution yield). (Note that our return calculations exclude applicable costs, 
                                                 including commission and interest.)

                                                 quarterly distribution) compares favorably to other yield-based alternatives as seen in the

                                                     We also believe that the MLP business model offers some hedge towards rising interest 
                                                     rates unlike the fixed income comparisons in Exhibit 3. While rising rates do pose a risk to 
                                                     valuation on income producing securities, we feel that these fears are overstated. We 
                                                     believe that normally, rising interest rates signal economic strength or rising inflation. In a 
                                                     strengthening economy, there is a greater demand for the energy products that MLPs 
                                                     handle. This in turn boosts throughput volumes and thus, MLP revenue. During periods of 
                                                     inflation, crude oil and natural gas prices tend to rise. We feel that this would lead to more 
                                                     drilling, production and need for the infrastructure that MLPs provide. Additionally, some 
                                                     MLP business activities contain inflation-linked escalators. In our opinion, such gains 
                                                     would help boost the distributions. See the MLP Industry report released on August 24,

                                              TLLP is 58% owned by TSO and 42% by the public. The 56% LP interest combined with 
                                              the 2% GP interest (which gives TSO the incentive distribution rights (IDRs)) helps to align 
                                              the interests of TSO and TLLP.  TSO has a strong incentive to grow TLLP’s distribution to 
                                              achieve the “high splits.” The high splits are a GP’s “happy place” where the general 
                                              partner receives 50% of all incremental distributions paid. TLLP has an advantage vs. 
                                              other MLPs without a strong, well-aligned parent company.

                                                The Crude Oil Gathering segment, which consists of the High Plains system, is located in 
                                                the Williston Basin, one of the most prolific onshore crude oil basins in the US and 
                                                includes production from the more commonly known Bakken shale formation.   

                                                The High Plains system services a significant portion of the Bakken/Williston formation 
                                                through its approximately 700 miles of pipeline and storage system and expansive truck 
                                                fleet. The pipeline has current capacity to transport 70,000 bpd, while the truck fleet can 
                                                deliver an additional 23,000 bpd. The High Plains system utilizes 24 crude oil storage and 
                                                breakout tanks with a total combined capacity of 482,000 barrels, 13 proprietary and six 
                                                third-party truck receipt locations, 44 proprietary and eight third-party pipeline gathering 
                                                receipt stations (collection points) and 11 relay stations to deliver crude oil to Tesoro's 
                                                Mandan refinery.

         Historically, the Mandan refinery was the only destination for the High Plains system. 
         However, the existing system has five pipeline interconnects.  This is where we believe 
         TLLP can unlock further value. TLLP is currently testing High Plains to increase the overall 
         capacity above 70,000 bpd, as the bulk of the system is large enough to handle more 
         capacity (the spur to Mandan is the main bottleneck at 70,000bpd). As production in the 
         Bakken continues to increase, we believe that TLLP will be able to increase overall 
         capacity on the system and serve more clients than just Tesoro’s Mandan refinery.  
         Exhibit 8 displays the current interconnect potential for the High Plains pipelines. 
          

         We believe the High Plains system is strategically placed and offers a low cost advantage 
         to peers. The location of Tesoro’s refinery creates an opportunity for Bakken producers to 
         transport oil to market more quickly than other transportation options. We believe that 
         such an advantage puts the High Plain system in position to grow volumes and creates an 
         opportunity for highly accretive bolt-on growth projects.

         Terminalling, Transportation and Storage  

         The Terminalling, Transportation and Storage segment consists of eight refined products 
         terminals located in California, Utah, Alaska, Washington and North Dakota, a crude oil 
         storage facility, three short-haul crude supply pipelines and two short-haul refined product 
         delivery pipelines. The terminals have an aggregate truck and barge delivery capacity of 
         approximately 229,000 bpd while the crude storage facilities hold a total shell capacity of 
         approximately 878,000 barrels with plans to expand storage capacity in 2011 (see the 
         growth drivers section above). 

         We believe the Terminalling, Transportation and Storage segment offers safe, fee-based 
         cash flows that are protected by long-term contracts with Tesoro. Currently, TLLP has 
         contractual minimums on 100% of the storage capacity, 82% of the short-haul pipeline 
         throughput and 87% of the terminal throughput (see contracts). We believe that as TLLP 
         opens the assets to third parties, the excess capacity may be absorbed. 

                                                                                                    9

  Investment Thesis

  We initiate coverage of TLLP with an Outperform rating and $30 price target. It is currently our top pick among our MLP coverage. We
  believe  TLLP  represents  the  first  opportunity  since  WES  went  public  in  May  2008  to  own  a  100%  fee-based  (low-risk)  MLP  with
  significant dropdown and organic growth potential early in its life cycle. We forecast double-digit distribution growth CAGR for the next
  several  years  as  TLLP  expands  organically  and  completes  acquisitions.  Assets  include  a  large  crude  oil  gathering  system  in  North
  Dakota  and  Montana  that  provides  exposure  to  Bakken  formation  growth.  We  believe  the  Bakken  is  in  the  very  early  stages  of
  development and that TLLP provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

  Price Target Calculation

  Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
  stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3- 5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
  The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015.

  Key Risks to Price Target
  n  Weak refined product demand
  n  Potential to overpay for acquisitions
  n  Acquisition integration
  n  Rising interest rates
  n  Economic weakness
  n  Capital markets access
  n  Major change in MLP tax code
  n  FERC regulatory risk
  n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
  n  Counterparty credit risk
  n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
  n  Extreme weather
  n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
     units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
     a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
     borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
     before making an investment in the sector.
