  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $21 price target for Tangoe by applying a roughly 4.5x EV/S multiple to our FY13E revenue of $169.2M. We note the
  SaaS peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' revenue. We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a
  deep  technological  SaaS  foundation,  the  "stickiness"  of  its  installed  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,
  subscriptions model), its robust growth rates, market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its
  model, Tangoe should trade more in line with its peers.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.
