ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS, $45.98, Buy, Price Target: $62)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like what we view as ANSYS global franchise in advanced simulation applications, and expect the companys cyclical 
demand fundamentals to continue strengthening over the course of 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we like the alignment 
between global wireless technology demand, and integration of electro-magnetic simulation with fluid and mechanical 
multiphysics in the flagship ANSYS product platform. We believe the companys acquisition of Apache Design Solutions, a 
successful startup with a strategic focus on semiconductor power integrity and low power requirements, will further solidify 
the companys position as the scale leader in simulation software technology.   
 
Valuation  
Our $62 price target is based on a 22.5x P/E on our revised CY2012 EPS estimate of $2.75. ANSS shares trade at a 20x 
P/E based on our revised CY2011 pro forma EPS estimate of $2.50. Shares of the design peer group median current-year 
P/E multiple is currently 19x. We believe that ANSS shares deserve a premium valuation compared to the peer group, 
based on what we view as the company's global franchise, unique competitive strengths, and first-ever scale attributes in 
fluid, and electromagnetic simulation software applications. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
ANSYS is historically acquisitive; acquisitions may involve product and organizational integration challenges: We believe 
CY11 will see ANSYS more active again with its M&A strategy, perhaps to consolidate market share or possibly add 
selected vertical market depth to its applications. ANSYS has capital-intensive end markets. Several of ANSYS' largest 
verticals,  including aerospace, automobiles and  industrial  equipment are  very  cyclical and subject to the more harsh 
capital constraints of those particular end markets.     
 
 
Fortinet Inc.  (NASDAQ: FTNT, $17.54, Buy, Price Target: $29)  
Dan Cummins | 212-468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We regard the recent slump in Fortinets share price as a buying opportunity because, above all, recent results continue to 
point to global market share gain, notwithstanding EMEA mid-year deceleration. In 2Q, revenues grew by 40%, or more, 
in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. Deferred revenue was up qtr/qtr, despite EMEA, implying a healthy pipeline overall for 
2H-2011. In our model, we project billings growth of 25% for 2011E. Growth in product revenue (45% of total), which, in 
turn, generates software subscriptions, which drives deferred revenue, is showing a strong positive trend, up 30-35% yr/yr 
for the first half of 2011, and renewal rates remain at record high levels. While developments in Europe raise the risk 
profile of FTNT shares, we continue to have high confidence in the companys competitive position and fundamentals.  
 
Valuation  
We base our $29 price target on a FCF per share multiple of 30x our FY12 FCF/share estimate of $0.95, above the 
current 26x based on our 2011E FCF estimate of $0.84. The security group peer median FCF multiple is currently 21x. 
We believe investors will continue to pay a premium multiple for the company's ability to potentially outperform estimates. 
Accordingly, we believe a 31x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
Although Fortinet is a leader in high-growth, unified-threat, management technology and appliances, there is a demand 
relationship to the core firewall technology market, which is mature and likely to experience increasing commoditization 
over time. As the market of firewall/VPN continues to mature over time, competitive pressures could erode margins and 
result in market share loss.

LSI Corp. (NYSE: LSI, $6.29, Buy, Price Target: $9)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
We are adding  LSI to  our Conviction  List, following  our recent  upgrade  of the stock. While demand across key end 
markets such as server/computing, data center storage, and wireless infrastructure has become increasingly uncertain, 
we nonetheless are encouraged by recent success in converting design wins across storage and networking into revenue. 
We expect revenue uplift from additional hard drive, server and networking design wins in the coming quarters. With room 
for additional operating leverage, we also expect company operating margins to progress toward the stated goal of 17% 
versus 2Q11 operating margin of 12.4%.  
 
Valuation  
Our price target of $9 represents 15x our new CY12 EPS estimate of $0.58. Our new price target implies a PEG of 1.1x, a 
slight premium the comparable median of 0.9x reflecting improving design win and share momentum. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The key risks for LSI Corporation include the following: 1) The market for storage and hard drive semiconductors remains 
competitive  and  it  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established  companies  as  well  as  emerging  solid-state  drive 
vendors.  2)  The  market  for  networking  is  highly  competitive  and  it  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established 
companies. 3) The company's revenue stream is exposed to any macro-driven slowdown in the spending in the enterprise 
and infrastructure end-markets, 4) The company's revenue is concentrated at two large customers, and is exposed to 
either slowing demand for these customers and/or potential design losses to competitors. 
 
 
Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX, $26.48, Buy, Price Target: $35)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
A strong beat-and-raise quarter with no apparent signs of weakness in any specific geography and vertical showcased 
MLNX's growth momentum and re-affirmed our conviction in one of our favorite names in our coverage universe. Based 
on  this  quarter's  performance,  we  have  further  evidence  to  believe  that  the  scale,  low  latency,  and  I/O  speed 
requirements,  hitherto  restricted  to  the  High  Performance  Computing  (HPC)  market,  are  now  becoming  increasingly 
common in mainstream Enterprise and Cloud applications, which should continue to drive MLNX on a strong growth path 
in the foreseeable future. Hence, we reiterate our Buy rating on MLNX shares and continue to include it on our Conviction 
Buy list. 
 
Valuation  
Our price target for MLNX shares is $35, which is based on a 20x P/E multiple on our FY12 EPS estimate of $1.60 and 
$2.78 cash per share. We believe a 20x P/E multiple is appropriate as it reflects a PEG ratio of 1x on our assumption of 
an earnings growth rate of 20%. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Mellanox is a component supplier to powerful OEMs that enjoy pricing leverage and are likely to change order patterns 
rapidly, which may affect revenue visibility for MLNX. Although Mellanox has enjoyed a virtual monopoly in InfiniBand, 
serious competition in the form of QLogic has begun to emerge in the market. QLogic could potentially cause severe price 
competition in the future as it tries to gain market share from MLNX. With the acquisition of VOLT, the InfiniBand market 
has become a two-horse race, in our view. If OEMs determine that they need to dual source their InfiniBand adaptors, 
QLGC could gain significant share in the market.  Additionally, customer inertia may prevent InfiniBand from moving 
beyond its current niche of High Performance Computing.

OPNET Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPNT, $29.55, Buy, Price Target: $43)   
Daniel Cummins | (212) 468-7010 | dcummins@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We like OPNETs product strategy and execution in application performance monitoring (APM), where new challenges of 
complexity and network diversity among next generation, process-driven applications are creating growth opportunities. 
We believe OPNET will continue to raise its competitive profile in strategic APM, while taking share from a range of larger 
incumbents; the company has been reaping benefits of focused efforts to expand and improve the capabilities of its sales 
function, and we expect this trend to continue.    
 
Valuation   
Our $43 per-share price target is based on a P/FCF multiple of 28x based on our FY13E FCF estimate of $1.55 (+25% 
yr/yr). OPNT shares currently trade at 27x our FY12E FCF per share estimate of $1.24. At our $43 price target 12 months 
from now, OPNT shares would trade at a 32x P/E based on our FY2013 pro forma EPS estimate of $1.34, compared to 
the current 33x P/E multiple based on our FY12 estimate of $1.00. We believe investors will continue to pay a high 
multiple of FCF for OPNT shares in anticipation of strong revenue growth and margin accretion. Accordingly, we believe a 
28x multiple is appropriate. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
The  Network  instrumentation  market  is  fragmented,  and  competition  amongst  existing  vendors  could  be  a  source  of 
margin compression. Large players could develop their own solutions and infringe upon OPNET's turf. OPNET occupies a 
niche in the broader Network Management space. The niche does not have a large vendor in this space. We believe that 
continued macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to a larger portion of deals getting consummated over longer cycles, 
hence, delaying revenue recognition. 
 
 
Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL, $24.78, Buy, Price Target: $40)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We believe Oracle today exerts greater global account control than ever, resulting in share gains of customers IT budgets 
and a stronger ability to enter new markets. Supplemented by its successful acquisition strategy, Oracle has attained the 
#1 market share position in both the database and middleware markets, and a #2 position in the application software 
market.  Because  this  stack  is  increasingly  based  on  industry  standards  for  programming  and  exposing  data,  the 
marketplace is gravitating toward Oracle's offerings over those of second-tier providers, in our view.  Additionally, ORCL 
has only reported a full-year EPS decline once in the last 12 years (and even then, only 4%), and we believe ORCL's 
earnings resiliency has improved, as recurring maintenance revenue comprises 50% of revenue, versus 37% in FY02, 
and Oracle is advantaged by greater economies of scale today. In our view, this earnings resiliency and earnings growth 
that are more attractive to that of the S&P 500 deserve a premium valuation rather than a discount or market-average 
valuation, and we believe this equilibrium will be restored over time.   
 
Valuation   
On CY: 2012E P/E basis, ORCL trades at 13x (ex-cash) our CY:2012 estimate of $2.54, which is in line with the S&P 500 
group average of 13x. Our $40 price target for ORCL shares is based on a 15x (ex-cash) multiple applied to our FY:2013 
EPS estimate of $2.67/share. We believe that ORCL maintains a slightly higher valuation multiple for its out-year and 
believe this multiple is appropriate since, historically, ORCL shares have traded at an in-line to slight premium to the 
average market multiple of 15x, and we expect the shares to continue to trade at a multiple that is in line with the historical 
level. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks  to  our  price  target  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  1)  Prolonged  weakness  in  IT  spending;  2)  macroeconomic 
fluctuations;  3)  acquisition  integration  challenges;  4)  competition;  5)  departure  of  key  management  personnel  could 
impede our price target.

QUALCOMM Inc.  (NASDAQ: QCOM, $46.52, Buy, Price Target: $75)  
Mark McKechnie | 415-249-1988 | mmckechnie@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
QUALCOMM delivered a solid report and outlook in what we view as a "transitional" quarter ahead of two major 2H11 
drivers: Apples iPhone5 and Nokia's WindowsPhone7 (WP7) models. The quarter confirmed our thesis on QCOM as the 
best large cap semi play on smart phones and tablets as it powered through rough overall industry waters with improved 
earnings prospects. We look for potential upside relative to our new forecast to become more apparent as we approach 
the September reporting period.   
 
Valuation   
Our QCOM $75 price target is based on 21.4x our FY12 (September) EPS estimate of $3.50 and does not include $11.97 
per share in net cash. We justify the multiple on 1) our view of QCOM's leading royalty and chip position in smart phones, 
2) what we see as near-term potential upside from increased chips share with the iPhone5 and NOK's WindowsPhone7, 
and 3) what we see as potential upside from SnapDragon tablet wins.   
 
Risks to Price Target 
Risks to our price target include: 1) Slower-than-anticipated industry unit growth; 2) Faster erosion of handset average 
selling prices; 3) Increased chip competition; and 4) general compression of market multiples.    
 
 
RightNow Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: RNOW, $27.52, Buy, Price Target: $38)   
Brian Schwartz | 415-249-1982 | bschwartz@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Our recent survey work indicates the marketplace momentum of replacing legacy, single-channel on premise Customer 
Experience  solutions  with  multi-channel  cloud  based  solutions  is  accelerating  compared  to  six  month  ago.  We  think 
RNOW will benefit disproportionately from this replacement cycle since RightNow Technologies is the farthest along in 
building an Enterprise-scale cloud-based Customer Experience suite of solutions for large B2C businesses, in our view.  
Additionally, RightNows business model is positively levered to the mobile tsunami trend due to its volume-based usage 
pricing  model.  These  strong  market  tailwinds  plus  reported  TTM  current  software  backlog  growth  of  27%  gives  us 
confidence that new business and cash flow trends are accelerating, and we maintain a positive bias to current consensus 
expectations.  We believe the shares could appreciate through either higher estimate revisions or multiple expansion as 
the current discount valuation to the SaaS group average narrows over time.    
 
Valuation  
Our $38 price target is based on approximately 27x our EV/2012E OCF of $48M (cash from operations), which is a slight 
discount to the current average SaaS companies' EV/FTM OCF estimated multiple of 29. We use a 27 multiple to derive 
our price target, as we expect the shares to trade at a multiple that is essentially in line with the SaaS group average.    
 
Risks to Price Target   
Risks to our price target include: 1) Competition; 2) macroeconomic fluctuations; 3) acquisition integration challenges; 4) 
increased churn; and 5) slow customer adoption of Cx solutions. 
 
 
Skyworks Solutions Inc.   (NASDAQ: SWKS, $18.78, Buy, Price Target: $30)  
Suji De Silva | 415-249-1987 | sdesilva@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis 
We are adding SWKS to our Conviction List. We expect relative resilience in the smartphone and tablet markets given 
strong customer interest and product cycles. With multiple smartphone customers ramping new models in the next few 
quarters, we expect SWKS to benefit from its market leading position in the handset radio frequency components market. 
We  also  expect  benefit  from  increasing  use  of  wireless  connectivity  beyond  traditional  handsets.  Lastly,  we  are

                                                                                                   Industry Report       

                                                    
 
encouraged by the company's ramp of new competitive filter products to more aggressively address a broader array of 
market opportunities. 
 
Valuation  
Our $30 price target is based on a 14x target multiple on our CY12 EPS estimate of $2.10, implying a PEG of 0.8x, a 
slight premium to the comparable average 0.7x, which we believe is deserved, given the company's market position and 
share gain opportunity. 
 
Risks to Price Target   
The key risks for Skyworks Solutions include the following: 1) The markets for handset front-end components and analog 
are  highly  competitive,  and  the  company  faces  competition  from  a  number  of  established  competitors,  along  with 
competition in analog. 2) Consistency in financial results in recent years leaves the stock more vulnerable than peers to a 
management  execution  misstep,  in  our  view.  3)  We  believe  that  the  increasing  complexity  of  wireless  front-end 
components could expand the risk of product delays and/or issues versus in the past. 
 
 
Spansion, Inc.  (NYSE: CODE, $14.16, Buy, Price Target: $25)  
Krishna Shankar | 415-249-6367 | kshankar@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis    
We   view   Spansion   as   the   leader   in   the   embedded   NOR  flash   memory  market   for   diversified   end   markets   in 
industrial/automotive,  telecom/networking,  computing  and  consumer  electronics.  Since  emerging  from  bankruptcy,  we 
believe that Spansion has executed well in regaining share in the embedded flash market with consistent revenue growth, 
higher margins, and free cash flow using its proprietary MirrorBit flash memory technology and a "FabLite" manufacturing 
strategy. Spansion has what we view as: a diversified customer base of over 4,000 global customers, good design win 
momentum, a focused new management team, a flexible Fab Lite manufacturing strategy and recent strong revenue and 
earnings growth.   
 
Valuation   
Our $25 price target is based on an approximate 10x P/E on our calendar 2011E pro forma EPS estimate of $2.55 relative 
to our outlook for 12% secular earnings growth. Given the consolidation in the NOR industry likely leading to more stable 
pricing with Spansion and Micron technology being the two main competitors in the high-performance embedded NOR 
flash  market,  strong  demand  drivers  currently  in  the  embedded  NOR  market,  technology  leadership,  and  good 
management execution, we believe that a forward multiple of 10x on our calendar 2011E EPS is justified relative to our 
Spansion secular earnings growth outlook. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
The  following  risks  are  inherent  to  investing  in  Spansion:  general  business  and  economic  conditions;  demand  for 
products; changes in customer order patterns; the pricing of products driven by capacity versus demand; the continued 
development, qualification, and availability of innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; the 
ability to reduce costs; manufacturing risks; inventory risk; manufacturing yield risks, the ability to recruit and retain skilled 
engineers and other personnel; and currency risks. In addition, Spansion's recent emergence from Chapter 11 implies that 
the company has to re-engage and win back new and existing customers who may not have a business relationship. 
Spansion also has to rapidly transition to a "Fab Lite" flexible, manufacturing strategy of using its captive Fab in Austin, 
coupled with foundries such as Elpida, SMIC etc. Additionally, Spansion still has significant debt load which may constrain 
its operational flexibility; especially in weak economic times.

VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW, $76.76, Buy, Price Target: $110)   
Rajesh Ghai, CFA | 415-249-6365 | rghai@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Our conviction in VMWs growth story is further enhanced after yet another beat-and-raise in VMWs 2QFY11, driven by 
broad-based growth across geographies, verticals and product-lines. FCF/share was, once again, well ahead of EPS, 
indicating to us that VMW continues to be a very strategic vendor for its customers, who remain willing to sign multi-year 
contracts with VMW and keep driving VMW's deferred revenue higher. We remind investors that, despite VMW's strong 
investment mode, we think it remains likely to see significant operating margin expansion in future yearspotentially a 
1000-point expansion over the next three years. In our view, this could lead to a very significant increase in earnings 
power and FCF generation, well ahead of current, long-term Street estimates. We believe VMW is the undisputed leader 
in virtualization and Cloud build-outthe top IT secular growth trends today in our view. In our opinion, VMW is poised to 
extend  this  lead  as  it  innovates  ahead  of  its  competitors  and  executes  effectively,  potentially  driving  stronger  FCF 
generation  and  significant  operating  margin  expansion  in  the  future.  With  a  new  product  cycle  (vSphere  5)  and  an 
upcoming trade show as likely upside catalysts, we continue to include the name on our Conviction Buy list. 
 
Valuation   
Our $110 price target is based on an approximate, ex-cash per share, 31x multiple to our FY12 FCF estimate of $3.30 per 
share. The 31x multiple implies a PEG ratio of 1.03x, assuming a long-term FCF growth rate of ~30%, which, we believe 
is appropriate, given the early stage of the company's opportunity and its strong strategic positioning. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Competition  with  Microsoft  and  the  open-source  community.  Challenges  associated  with  any  new  technology.  EMC 
owning 97% of voting rights and likely competing with VMware in some areas. Acquisitions could lead to dilution.

Active Network Inc. (NYSE: ACTV, $16.23, Buy, Price Target: $23)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
Active is a leading provider of cloud-based reservation and marketing solutions serving a variety of customer groups, 
including  business  events,  community  activities,  outdoors,  and  sports.  Our  Buy  rating  is  based  on:  1)  strong  growth 
potential  in  an  underpenetrated  $10B  North  American  technology  fee  opportunity,  2)  Active  provides  a  strong  value 
proposition to both organizations and consumers, 3) numerous growth drivers that should lead to mid-teens long-term 
growth, and 4) attractive financial characteristics with highly predictable revenues and high incremental EBITDA margins.   
 
Valuation   
Our $23 per-share price target for ACTV shares is based on 25x our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $54M. We believe a 25x 
multiple is justified given our view for 35%-plus long-term EBITDA growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks for Active Network include risks of integrating acquisitions; competition; slower adoption of web-based reservation 
systems; the macroeconomic environment; transition to the ActiveWorks platform; expansion into new businesses and 
risks surrounding International expansion.   
 
 
Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU, $126.98, Buy, Price Target: $200)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis    
We  remain  positive  on  BIDU  shares,  and  expect  continued  strong  growth  driven  by  1)  continued  consumer  Internet 
adoption  we expect China to add another 70 million Internet users in 2011 up from approximately 450M at the end of 
2010 (33% online penetration); 2) continued merchant adoption  we estimate Baidu has approximately 5% market share 
among  its  addressable  market  of  5 million  larger  SMEs  in  China;  3)  strong  growth  in  emerging  categories  including 
eCommerce; 4) continued monetization improvements. We believe these factors should lead to 60% plus top-line growth 
in 2011 and we expect continued strong incremental margins which we expect to lead to 70% plus EPS growth.    
 
Valuation   
Our $200 price target for BIDU shares is based on a 45x P/E to our 2012 pro forma EPS estimate. We believe a 45x 
multiple is justified, given our outlook for 40%-plus long-term EPS growth. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Key risks for Baidu include an economic slowdown in China, increased regulatory action, increased competition, and lack 
of a developed eCommerce market.    
 
 
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY, $27.16, Buy, Price Target: $41)    
Aaron Kessler, CFA | (415) 249-6366 | akessler@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
eBay reported a solid quarter with strength in both Payments (29% Y/Y FX neutral vs. 27% last quarter) and improved 
Marketplace GMV (10% Y/Y vs. 8% in 1Q). U.S. GMV accelerated to 14% Y/Y, driven primarily by an improved user 
experience, better search, and more top- rated sellers. We are encouraged by the improved business fundamentals and 
solid traction of the company's growth initiatives, such as mobile payment. Payments growth momentum continued with 
total payment revenue up 29% Y/Y FX neutral (vs. 27% last quarter), driven by further penetration on both Merchant 
Services and on-eBay. Segment margin expanded 200 bps Y/Y benefiting from stable transaction margin, continuing 
operating leverage and improvement in BML.  Both U.S. and international were solid in the quarter: U.S. non-vehicle GMV 
accelerated 400 bps sequentially, mainly driven by improvement in the user interface, search experience (i.e., removal of

duplicate listings), and more sales from trusted sellers. Solid European growth and stabilizing Korean growth led to 200 
bps sequential growth acceleration for international in 2Q.  
 
Valuation  
Our $41 EBAY price target is based on approximately 16x our 2012 PF EPS estimate of $2.34 plus net cash, which we 
believe is appropriate given our outlook of 5-10% long-term growth for the marketplace business and 15-20% long-term 
growth for the payment business. For our price target, we apply a 12x multiple to Marketplace 2012E PF EPS, a 25x 
multiple to Payments 2012E EPS, and add $4 in cash/investments, which equates to our $41 PT. 
 
Risks to Price Target 
Key risks for eBay include competition, adverse currency movements, inability to improve eBay's user experience, and 
economic weakness. 
 
 
Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS, $19.31, Buy, Price Target: $28)    
Atul Bagga | 415-249-6362 | abagga@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We are positive on ERTS's proposed acquisition of PopCap, given growth in social and smart phone games that was 
faster than we had expected; better than we expected EPS accretion from the deal; the quality of PopCap assets; and a 
potential to accelerate growth in higher-quality Games-as-a-Service business.  We are raising our estimates and  now 
expect EPS growth at 21% Y/Y and 39% Y/Y EPS during FY12 and FY13 respectively, driven largely by growing revenue 
contribution from relatively lucrative Games-as-a-Service segment.   
 
Valuation 
Our $28 price target on ERTS shares is based on a 26x PE (net of cash) on our FY12 EPS estimate of $0.82 versus a 13x 
average  for  the  shares  of  the  peer  group. We  think  that  the  premium  is  appropriate,  given  that  we  believe  that  the 
company  has strong franchises and the  potential to monetize these franchises on emerging platforms and given the 
company's focus on the faster-growing Games-as-a-Service segment.    
 
Risks to Price Target 
Gaming  continues  to  be  a  hit-or-miss-driven  business,  and  predicting  successful  titles  versus  unsuccessful  titles  is 
extremely difficult. The risk is especially high for the new and unproven IPs, and a company's reliance on the new IPs and 
the titles in the established franchises to reach the revenue target opens it to risk of a revenue miss. Additionally, we 
believe there are macro headwinds given the increasing popularity of the used games and free-to-play online games.   
 
 
Velti PLC (NASDAQ: VELT, $10.64, Buy, Price Target: $22)    
Robert Coolbrith | (415) 249-6363 | rcoolbrith@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
Velti reported a strong Q2 result (revenue of $34.4M was up 57% Y/Y and came in 8% higher than our forecast), but the 
stock traded down we believe in reaction to higher OpEx investments and negative (and we believe misplaced) read-
through from Motricitys negative Q2 earnings report. We believe that the sell-off in VELT shares is misguided and that 
shares represent a compelling value at 8.2x our FY12E EBITDA estimate of $87M. At current levels, we believe investors 
have  the  unique  opportunity  to  acquire  a  leading  SaaS  tools/solutions  provider  serving  the  rapidly  emerging  mobile 
marketing and advertising ecosystem for a traditional media multiple. We believe that shares will rebound during the 
companys seasonally strong 2H and that shares should be aggressively acquired at the current valuation.  
 
Valuation 
We note that shares of interactive marketing services peers currently trade at an average FY12E EV/EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 8x, while SaaS companies currently trade at an average of 16x FY12E EV/EBITDA. Given the company's 
growing SaaS revenue streams and what we view as its superior growth and long-term margin prospects, we believe 
VELT shares should trade toward the higher end of the 8-16x range, especially given the fact that the company is likely to

against our 2012 EBITDA estimate of $86.8M to derive our $22 12-month price target. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Risks to our price target  include the  very early stage of development of the mobile marketing/advertising technology 
opportunity, customer/category concentration, geographic risk, ongoing development of internal controls, working capital 
requirements, competition, and the high degree of seasonality present in the business.  
 
HEALTHCARE / LIFE SCIENCES  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY, $6.62, Buy, Price Target: $18)    
Marko Kozul, M.D. | 415-249-6364 | mkozul@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
ALNY is making solid progress towards its 5x15 goals by advancing numerous early stage programs and preparing for 2 
important 4Q11 dataset announcements. In 4Q11, we are primarily focused on ALN-TTR proof of concept (POC) data that 
will be presented at a major Amyloid meeting. We view ALN-TTR as one of ALNY's most promising emerging pipeline 
compounds based on due diligence with our KOLs and therapeutic potential in a disease with unmet medical need and 
clear genetically defined targets. Given a low $60M EV and near-term drivers, ALNY represents an attractive risk reward, 
in our view.  
 
2H11 Drivers: We believe the next two years (and especially 2H11) will show two additional important pipeline proof of 
concept (POC) data sets that we expect could drive shares significantly from current levels. In 3Q11, ALNY plans to 
announce Phase 1 POC data for ALN-TTR01 in TTR Amyloidosis. The trial's primary goal is to evaluate safety, but it also 
includes secondary end points the Street should find meaningful, such as ALN-TTR treatment's effect on circulating TTR 
plasma levels measured as percentage (%) lowering of TTR from pretreatment/baseline TTR levels. Our TTR consultants 
would be encouraged to observe 10-20% plasma TTR reductions while they believe up to 50% is also possible in this trial. 
They generally believe a 50% plasma TTR reduction is enough to cause TTR plaque regression or slow progression of 
the disease by 50% (factor of 2). By YE11, we believe ALN-PCS data for hypercholesterolemia patients should become 
available. ALNY has not yet specified the end points for this trial, but we believe it is also committed to measuring efficacy 
in a manner that would be appreciated by the Street. In 2011, ALNY further plans to disclose two additional pipeline 
programs. In 2012, ALNY plans to enter ALN-ALN-HTT for Huntington's Disease and ALN-HPN for refractory anemia into 
the clinic. 
 
Valuation   
Our 12-month price target of $18 is based on a sum-of-parts analysis by estimating YE11 cash (12-month forward) at 
approximately $8-9 per share and adding $9 per share ($410M) in pipeline technology value. Risks include IP litigation; 
delivery failures; clinical, regulatory, and competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and extended timelines to potential 
profitability.   
 
Risks to Price Target  
ALNYs  lead  product  candidates  appear  to  be  at  least  a  few  years  from  market  and  may  face  significant  clinical, 
regulatory, and competitive risks. Additionally, IP litigation and failure to make advances in RNAi delivery could lead to 
extended timelines to potential profitability. We also anticipate significant changes to the marketplace as new medicines 
are  introduced.  To  reiterate,  primary  investment  risks  include  IP  litigation;  delivery  failures;  clinical,  regulatory,  and 
competitive risks for pipeline candidates; and future financing risk.

NuVasive Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA, $21.08, Buy, Price Target: $39)    
Sameer Harish | 415-249-1989 | sharish@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis 
We expect NuVasive sales growth to accelerate through 2012.  We expect significant upside to NUVAs share price if the 
company continues to meet or beat numbers and demonstrates additional leverage in 2011. NuVasives suite of minimally 
invasive spine implants and instruments are designed to improve surgical outcomes, reduce blood loss and pain, and 
speed recovery. The company has successfully created a market for its lateral access spine products and continues to 
increase the number of physician users. Additionally, NuVasive has a high-margin business model boasting 80%+ gross 
margins implant business and serves the robust and fast growing minimally-invasive spine market.   
 
Momentum in minimally invasive and lateral spine surgery is building. NuVasive expects this segment of the spine market 
to grow 15% in 2011 despite a flat to down market for total spine procedures. However, a key driver for the market interest 
is the recent flurry of competitive product introductions. Ultimately, we believe the heightened interest in minimally invasive 
and lateral access surgery may increase overall surgeon interest in XLIF and NeuroVision. We believe NuVasive will be 
able to convert many of these surgeons to XLIF in the future with superior nerve avoidance technology, supportive clinical 
data, and a market-leading portfolio of lateral focused implants and tools. Channel checks have shown more established 
physicians tend to seek XLIF training, often seeking better techniques to benefit their patients after years of limited clinical 
success. These surgeons tend to be stickier, longer-term adopters of technology, we believe, and less likely to pursue 
lower cost alternatives which may lack critical features. Notably, driving physician utilization through training is at the 
center of NuVasives near-term growth strategy. Operating leverage will also be driven by sale force maturation, as well as 
an expanding product offering, and fixed-cost efficiencies, in our view.    
 
We believe international markets offer significant potential growth opportunities to complement U.S. growth. We expect 
NuVasive to invest heavily in international markets, which represent approximately $20% of the global $9 billion spine 
market.  Currently  international  revenues  comprise  only  5%  of  NuVasives  revenues;  however,  the  company  expects 
international revenues to comprise approximately 10% of revenues as the company approaches $1B in revenues. 
 
Valuation   
Our $39 price target is based upon 3x our 2012 revenue estimate of $602.9 million. This is a discount to the comparable 
medtech companies' averages of 3.8x 2012 revenues. NuVasive shares are trading at 1.8x our 2012 revenues and 2.1x 
our 2011 revenues of $532.8 million, compared to the medtech companies'' average of 3.9x 2011 revenues. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
NuVasive   operates   in   a   highly   competitive   and   dynamic   industrynew   technology   and   innovation   from   other 
organizations  may  change  NuVasives  ability  to  successfully  grow  in  their  markets  and  may  make  the  companys 
technology  obsolete. Additional  near-term risks include pricing  or reimbursement pressures, slowing market for spine 
surgery, timing and/or loss of orders to large hospital or physician groups, clinical guideline changes, delays in regulatory 
filings and supply and manufacturing disruptions. 
 
 
CLEANTECHNOLOGY 
 
Ceradyne Inc.  (NASDAQ: CRDN, $27.17, Buy, Price Target: $45)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We believe CRDN is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward increased applications of advanced 
ceramics in the industrial and energy market due to lightweight, heat, and wear advantages versus incumbent materials. 
Near term, we believe the company is getting better yield on its military business as it more effectively meets product 
specs. Second, the company is getting better utilization of its manufacturing assets having closed two facilities in 2010 
and getting better utilization as revenue increases. Third, the company's mix of products is migrating to higher margin 
opportunities in solar and industrial applications. We believe these three drivers will remain intact going forward. We are 
also encouraged by the company's investment in additional Boron separation capacity this year along with the accelerated

                                                                                                   Industry Report       

                                                    
 
traction of its Petrochem and bioglass products. We believe CRDN's improving product mix and end-market exposure are 
sufficient to drive material growth over the next several years.    
 
Valuation 
We give shares of CRDN a Buy rating and a price target of $45 based on 13x our 2012E EPS of $3.43, which we believe 
is appropriate as it is in line with peers.

Johnson Controls Inc.  (NYSE: JCI, $28.83, Buy, Price Target: $50)    
Colin Rusch | 212-468-7015 | crusch@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We  continue  to  highlight  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  Cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification  of  the  transportation  market.  We  continue  to  believe  the  company's  Power  Solutions  and  Automotive 
Experience segments are positioned for improvement. We also continue to believe that the company is well positioned to 
benefit from multi-year revenue and margin growth in its Building Efficiency segment. In addition, we note that JCI's entry 
into the demand response (DR) market signals that the DR market is a large enough addressable opportunity to warrant 
investment and that the economics of DR contracts are likely to change substantially over time and move more toward 
commodity pricing. We believe that JCI's entry into the DR market may be driven in part by a desire to retain customers. 
We also note interest from global energy regulators. In the United States, we note that FERC's Order 745 sets up a 
framework for DR providers to receive Locational Marginal Pricing, while the TVA's recent Integrated Resource Plan has 
increased focus on Energy Efficiency and DR. The European Energy Commission's recent communication on its 2011 
Energy Efficiency Plan states continued focus on Building Efficiency improvements. We also note statements from various 
news sources that Germany plans to increase its focus on Offshore Wind and Building Efficiency.   
 
Valuation  
We gives shares of JCI a Buy rating and price target of $50, based on 15x our FY2012E EPS estimate of $3.31, a modest 
premium to diversified industrial peers due to our expectation for JCI to grow faster than peers. JCI is at a slight premium 
to shares of diversified industrial peers due to its exposure to strong growth markets and positive product mix shift, in our 
opinion.  We  also  view  JCI  as  a  core  holding  for  cleantech  investors  with  exposure  to  energy  efficiency  and  the 
electrification of the transportation market.

Rogers Corp. (NYSE: ROG, $43.15, Buy, Price Target: $64)    
Shawn Severson | 415-249-1986 | sseverson@thinkequity.com 
 
Investment Thesis  
We are of the belief that Rogers is only in the early stages of a multi-year growth story built on key applications in the 
cleantech,  Internet  and  mass  transit  markets.  We  think  many  of  the  company's  products  are  high  value  added 
components, yet account for a relatively small portion of the bill of materials. This is a very important distinction as it can 
provide some price protection and insulation from competition as commercial volumes scale in markets such as electric 
vehicles  and  smart  phones/tablets,  in  our  view.  We  think  the  current  valuation  provides  a  significant  opportunity  for 
investors to build a position and we expect multiple expansion and solid earnings growth to prevail over the coming 12 
months.

Valuation  
Our price target for ROG shares is $64, based on a PE of 18x our FY12 EPS estimate of $3.43. Our target multiple is in 
line with the shares' average valuation since 2005. We believe the multiple expansion from the current level will be driven 
by investors recognizing what we view as strong secular megatrends developing for the company and the potential effect 
on earnings over the next three years. 
 
Risks to Price Target  
Although we believe the company is likely to benefit from positive megatrends, the company is still likely to be sensitive to 
broader  economic  conditions.  As  was  displayed  clearly  during  the  financial  crisis  and  subsequent  recession,  ROG's 
products and, hence, revenues are subject to cyclical trends. As we have stated previously, we believe ROG has solid 
growth  opportunities in some key sectors, but this  would not be enough to offset a meaningful decline in the  global 
economy. Failure of key growth markets to materialize. Our investment thesis is dependent a couple key markets and any 
significant or permanent disruption in those markets could have a sustained negative effect on the shares. Specifically, the 
prospects for 4G deployment, rail infrastructure in developing countries, and the adoption rate of HEV/EV around the 
world. 
 
 
CONSUMER  
 
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST, $74.36, Buy, Price Target: $90)  
Edward Weller | 415 249 1377 | eweller@thinkequity.com  
 
Investment Thesis  
With high gas prices and food inflation both intensifying the consumers usual quest for value, the combination of Costcos 
always  extremely  aggressive  pricing  and  what  appears  to  be  improving  customer  service  seem  to  us  to  be  driving 
increased frequency among existing members and new customer sign-ups, as well. Comp store customer traffic has been 
rising by 4% month after month for more than two years now and we believe that customers will continue to favor Costco 
for more of their purchases. Whats more, international operations (ex the UK business) seems to be firing on all cylinders 
and   an   incipient   recovery   in   Southern   California,   historically   Costcos   most   profitable   regions,   can   have   a 
disproportionately favorable impact on profitability for the next couple of years. We expect that ROIs will continue to rise, 
that  Costco  will  increase  its  growth  rate  and,  by  putting  more  capital  to  work  at  those  high  ROIs,  drive  increasing 
shareholder value. We reiterate our Buy on Costco.   
 
Valuation  
The rising valuations that we foresee in coming years derive directly from this recovery to normal  or recently normal  
returns, and those rising returns should drive richer valuations in our view. These generally rising returns, in combination 
with our estimates of slowly rising company investment suggest a price target a year from now of $90. (See our extensive 
valuation methodology in our report entitled  COST: Closes Quarter Strong, Recovery Still Building in Southern California , 
             th
dated May 18  , 2011.     
 
Risks to Price Target  
Potential risks to our forecasts and to our estimates and price target for Costco include: yet a further general economic 
slowdown  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  or  other  region  important  to  the  company;  interruptions  in  merchandise 
availability; continued upward pressure on operating expenses; and greater-than-anticipated competitive pressures.
