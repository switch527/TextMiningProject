                                          original guidance), and is hence lowering the EPS guidance by 1 cent to $0.41–0.42 from 
                                          $0.42–0.43. Without the increased share count             assumption EPS guidance would have 
                                          increased by $0.02. Q2 guidance was also provided, with revenue in the range $35–35.5m 
                                          vs. consensus $34.9m, adjusted EBITDA in the range $4.3–4.5m vs. consensus $4.5m and 
                                          adjusted EPS of $0.09 vs. consensus $0.09.  

                                          Clearly, the full year guidance has been raised in-line with the extent of the Q1 surprise. This 
                                          suggests management’s outlook for the remainin g three quarters of the year is unchanged 
                                          from the previously issued guidance. Howeve r, with the positive commentary around the 
                                          health of end markets (no macro weakness i  ssues) and the international expansion that 
                                          should gain traction in the coming quarters,          we think this leaves any risk of a surprise 
                                          favoring the upside.  

                                          Overall the quarter was said to be just very good and consistent with prior quarters. Tangoe 
                                          added 35 new customers in Q1, which is ab              ove the normal 20–30 additions that the 
                                          company has historically seen. We also notice  that there was a moderate uptick in Sales & 
                                          Marketing spending, which reflects the increased hiring in quota carrying sales reps and the 
                                          support staff around those sales people. In ou r view, this shows ongoing momentum in the 
                                          business and readiness to capture the still large end market opportunity. The ASP was in-
                                          line with the historically discussed range of $150–200k, the contribution mix towards total 
                                          revenue remained 50% fixed TEM and 40% mob ile TEM and the sources of revenue were

                                                            We believe this exemplifies Tangoe’s story of                                 being well exposed to a structural shift of 
                                                            enterprises outsourcing their Telecom Expense Management solution, which is still largely a 
                                                            greenfield opportunity and the company should be able to deliver good, consistent results 
                                                            into the medium term.

Tangoe Inc (TNGO, 08-May-2012, USD 19.30), 1-Overweight/1-Positive 
Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: 
Our coverage analysts use a relati ve rating system in which they rate stocks as 1-Overweight, 2-Equal Weight or 3-Underweight ( see definitions 
below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry sect  or (the "sector 
coverage universe"). 
In addition to the stock rating, we provide sector views which ra  te the outlook for the sector coverage universe as 1-Positive,   2-Neutral or 3-
Negative (see definitions below).  A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system.  Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratin gs alone. 
Stock Rating 
1-Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon. 
2-Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12  -
month investment horizon. 
3-Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected  total return of the sector coverage universe over a 12-month 
investment horizon.

Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of T   angoe Inc in the
previous 12 months. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker and/or liquidity provider in securities issued by Tangoe Inc or one of  its affiliates. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from Tangoe Inc in the past 12  months. 
Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate trades regularly in the securities of Tangoe Inc. 
Tangoe Inc is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate. 
Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $26 is based on a 2012 EV/Sales of 6.5x and revenue of $143m 
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of  the Barclays Research Price Target:  Tangoe could face increasing competition from telecom 
operators such as AT&T, especially where they have a large installed base. In addition, if IBM focused its considerable resource     s on the TEM 
market via its acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine this could be another issue. Tangoe has also been very acquisitive in its past  , and thus needs to
integrate its wide range of products. This poses execution risk since a failure to integrate products properly and loss of functionality could create
reputational damage.
