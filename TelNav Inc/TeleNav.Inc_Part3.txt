       New growth legs are beginning to gather strength 
       The challenge for Telenav remains its ability to regain investor confidence in its 
       long-term potential. This process will take  time as the market waits for meaningful 
       contribution from non-carrier businesses. As such, we reiterate our Hold rating. 

       Raising estimates and price target from $8 to $11, maintain Hold rating 
       We have valued Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 2% 
       perpetual growth rate in line with long-t erm industry growth and a 15% discount 
       rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta  of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%). Downside 
       risks include the threat of continued com  petition from free navigation providers 
       such as Google. Upside risks include the potential for increased ramp in premium 
       services and a better than advertising results from Sprint customers in 2011.

                               Good results and guidance 
                               Telenav reported Q4 results of $57 million, incl  uding a one-time payment from Ford of $6 
                               million. Excluding this the company still beat  our estimate and consensus of $49 million. Pro-
                               forma EPS of $0.27 also beat expectations of  $0.18. The company continue to demonstrate 
                               steady growth and operating leverage of   its SAAS revenue model. However, we remain 
                               cautious about trends affecting the navigati   on market particularly in regards to carrier 
                               ordering trends. We reiterate our Hold rating. 

                               Growth in all segments, with non-carrier businesses growing 
                               The company saw better than expected subscri ber growth and further diversification away 
                               from AT&T and Sprint. The two combined cont ributed only 70% of revenue in the quarter, 
                               down from over 90% in the past. This in part  reflects new payment terms from Sprint. More 
                               encouraging, the non-carrier business reache  d 19% of revenue, stripping out the Ford 
                               payment this figure stood at 8%, and the company continues to believe this can reach 13% 
                               by the end of FY12. The company continues to build its advertising business expanding it 
                               work with ad networks and its own internal direct sales effort.  

                               New growth legs are beginning to gather strength 
                               We view the companys long-term prospects as being built around consumer rather than 
                               carrier-oriented businesses. They  are continuing to make progress on the various growth 
                               initiatives. In China, they have finally launched nationwide service on China Mobiles network. 
                               This opportunity will take some time to mature,  but the sheer size of the installed base holds 
                               promise, and the move to national  availability is an important milestone. The companys ad 
                               business continues to gain pace, as noted ab  ove. This could even tually become the major 
                               engine of the companys growth, however the mobile ad market is in very early stages of 
                               discovery. Finally, we believe the company is well  positioned to compete in the shifting auto 
                               OEM landscape. They are already deep into their  partnership with Ford. We believe that over 
                               the next 12 months other OEMs will expand th eir navigation partners hips. For instance, we 
                               believe GM is working to revamp its OnStar offering. While we have no reason to believe that 
                               Telenav has won any such business, we think they are a strong competitor in the space. 

                               The challenge for Telenav remains its ability to regain investor confidence in its long-term 
                               potential. This process will take some time as the market waits for more meaningful 
                               contribution from non-carrier businesses. As such, we reiterate our Hold rating.

                               We are raising our price target from $8 to     $11 in line with our revised estimates. Our 
                               valuation is based on a discounted cash flow   analysis using a 2% perpetual growth rate in 
                               line with long-term industry growth and a 15%d  iscount rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a 
                               beta of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%).

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei      r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin     g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.      We would also see upside risk should the 
                                companys mobile ad platform take off sooner than expected.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular,  this will typically occur  for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock.

other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
