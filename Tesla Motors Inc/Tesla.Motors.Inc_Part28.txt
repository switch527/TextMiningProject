Tesla Motors, Inc.                                                                  December 22, 2010

                                                                       carter@capstoneinvestments.com   
Sell | Target: $22 

                     TSLA:  INITIATE WITH SELL AND $22 TARGET; PRICED 
 
                     FOR PERFECTION              
                     •  Initiate  coverage  of  Tesla  Motors  with  a  SELL  rating  and  $22  target 
                       price .  Tesla designs, manufactures and sells high-performance electric vehicles 
                       (EVs) and electric power train components including battery packs.    
                     •  Market for EVs will not grow in the time frame anticipated .  We believe 
                       the premium cost and range anxiety will limit  adoption of EVs.  Tesla has sold 
                       ~1,400 vehicles since 2008 primarily because of a high sales price ($109K base 
                       price) but also because of the lack of recharging infrastructure, range limitations 
                       versus conventional vehicles and lack of a brand name.  We expect that hybrid EVs 
                       (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) will continue to take the lion’s share of 
                       green conscious automobile consumers given their lower price points, better driving 
                       ranges and availability from brand name OEMs such as General Motors, Nissan and 
                       Toyota.   
                     •  Competition limits  Tesla’s addressable market to the small luxury car segment.  
                       Tesla admits its target market, at least for the first Model S (due in mid-2012), is the 
                       mid-to-high tier luxury markets with total global sales of less than 2M units globally 
                       for  2009.    Not  only  will  Tesla  compete  with  these  more  established  OEMs 
                       conventional vehicles but also their HEVs and EVs as well.   
                     •  Good battery technology but it is not a stand alone business.   We believe 
                       Tesla’s competitive advantage in battery technology for EVs will begin to decline as 
                       key OEM partners become competitors as EV adoption begins to accelerate.  We 
                       acknowledge their battery packs are among the best and lowest cost in the industry 
                       today.  Longer-term we are skeptical Tesla can drive the next leg of growth as they 
                       must convince OEMs to utilize their powertrain technology as well as battery packs.  
                     •  Reception  of  Model  S  is  crucial.  We  believe  the  niche  market,  competitive 
                       threats  and  substantial  capital  intensity  will  deliver  margins  below  consensus 
                       expectations.  Despite delivering the first federally compliant all-EV – the Roadster 
                       in 2008 - Tesla has never produced an EV at commercial production levels (nor 
                       profitably) and we do not believe they will achieve economies of scale to reach their 
                       projected EBIT targets of 14-16%.  Delays in introducing the Model S would cause 
                       significant cash flow reductions. Investing in Tesla is a bet that the Model S will be 
                       on time and on budget and that customer adoption is robust and consistent.  A lot 
                       of strong execution has to occur to justify the current valuation and management 
                       provides limited visibility. 
                     •  Risks  include   leveraging  its  competitive  advantage  in  battery  technology  to 
                       OEMs,  increased  government  financial  and  regulatory  support  and  faster  than 
                       expected introduction and/or adoption of the Model S.    
                     •  Priced for perfection.  Profitability is several years away yet the stock trades at a 
                       premium  on  EV/Sales,  EV/EBITDA  and  our  5-year  DCF  analysis.  Given  our 
                       concerns we believe the stock is overvalued and the risks outweigh the positives.

Company Description 
Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, Tesla Motors designs, manufactures and sells high- 
performance electric vehicles (EV) and electric powertrain technology including battery packs.  Launched 
in 2008, Tesla's Roadster was the first commercial EV that complied with federal standards with ~ 1,300 
vehicles sold through 3Q10.  Tesla's next-generation EV called the Model S is set to launch in 2012 with 
extended range features. The company also sells battery packs to Daimler for use in their smart and A-class 
EVs and recently agreed to jointly develop batteries for Toyota's RAV4 model.     
 
Technical Commentary 
After  failing  to  break  resistance  at  the  $22  level  from  the  July  IPO  through  September,  TSLA  shares 
recently  broke  out  to  the  upside.    However,  this  rally  has  now  faded.    Under  the  change  in  polarity 
principle, we see downside support at the $22 level, which is our price target.

                                 Initiating Coverage of TSLA with SELL and $22 

                                 Target; Price for Perfection 

                                 We are initiating coverage of Tesla Motors with a Sell rating and $22 target price.  
                                 Tesla designs, manufactures and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles and 
                                 advanced  electric  vehicle  powertrain  components.    In  general,  the  bull  case  for 
                                 Tesla centers around the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EV), particularly their 
                                 Model S series, at sufficient volumes to produce positive EBITDA margins through 
                                 fixed   cost   absorption.   These   EVs   must   be   delivered  on   budget   and   with 
                                 performance characteristics that rival conventional luxury vehicles at similar price 
                                 points.  In addition the bull case generally calls for increasing OEM partnerships 
                                 that add powertrain / battery pack volumes.  We believe that the more exciting part 
                                 of Tesla’s story is their battery technology.  Dramatically reducing the cost curve for 
                                 battery technology (by far the most expensive power train component) has long 
                                 been the holy grail for EVs and Tesla appears ahead of the curve.  The bear case is 
                                 that at the current valuation the stock has priced in stellar execution on all these 
                                 fronts.  We believe (1) EV adoption rate is overstated because of high total cost of 
                                 ownership and range limitations (2) lower than expected production volumes will 
                                 lead  to  higher  COGS  (3)  competition  from  established  automobile  OEMs  is 
                                 becoming fierce (4) luxury EV positioning limits market opportunity (5) lack of 
                                 brand name subjects Tesla to higher degree of exposure to product recalls / failure 
                                 (6) lack of near-term profitability.  We believe EVs have a place on U.S. roads but 
                                 believe there are better ways to gain exposure.  Therefore, we initiate coverage of 
                                 Tesla Motors with a SELL rating and $22 target price.

                                 Cost and range limitations will limit appeal of EVs  

                                 Cost : Tesla’s focus on electric vehicles (EVs) limits itself to a niche market.  Hybrid 
                                 EVs (HEV) and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), in particular, address a far wider audience 
                                 of  auto  buyers.    The  “green”  appeal  of  EV  and  PHEVs  is  clearly  growing  but 
                                 economic  reality  (average  MSRP  for  a  light-duty  vehicle,  i.e.  a  non-commercial 
                                 automobile,  is  ~$21,500)  will  limit  their  appeal.    Tesla  is  targeting  the  luxury 
                                 market, which is under 2M vehicles in total and an average price of $65,500.

                             Competitors are not just luxury sedans rather cheaper EV and PHEVs . 
                             One of the key questions for Tesla is – can they produce and sell enough cars before 
                             its  better-funded,  more  diversified  competitors,  introduce  their  own  EVs  and 
                             PHEVs at far low price points?  We do not think so.  Why?  First, the Chevy Volt 
                             was introduced in 4Q10 and the all-EV Nissan Leaf will be introduced in 1Q11.  
                             Both cars are slated to be between $10-$15K cheaper than the Tesla Model S, which 
                             is not due to be introduced until 2Q12 at the earliest.  Tesla will introduce the 
                             Model S at $57,400 vs. ($41,000 for the Volt and $32,780 for the Leaf).  Tesla may 
                             not  be  targeting  the  luxury  market,  and  its  limited  total  vehicle  size,  but  we 
                             continue  to  believe  the  appeal  is  the  EV  market  where  the  typical  consumer 
                             remains very cost-focused.    
                              
                             Profitability is driven by cost reductions, which will be largely volume 
                             driven . Tesla may be one of the first all electric vehicle OEMs, which is progressive 
                             and environmentally friendly, but that does not equate to profitability.  Look at the 
                             market for automobiles.  Sales correlate most strongly with economic activity and 
                             disposable income.  We contend that the market for the Roadster and Model S is 
                             very narrow so manufacturing economies of scale will prove difficult to achieve.  
                              
                             The keys to achieving profitability driven by the Model S are: 
                                (1)  Delivering a better battery that is more modular and easier to manufacture 
                                    at a low enough cost that its higher energy density does not offset other cost 
                                    savings. 
                                (2)  Source more components in-house to achieve better pricing. 
                                (3)  Produce dramatically higher vehicle units to cover higher fixed costs with 
                                    new manufacturing facility 
                              
                             Tesla’s  profitability  depends  largely  on  the  company  cutting  vehicle  production 
                             costs by ~40% as it moves from the Roadster to the Model S.  However, we lack 
                             visibility into exactly how Tesla will lower production costs so we project them 
                             based on management commentary.

                             Battery : The battery pack must have greater energy density because the Model S is 
                             heavier which must be offset by a reduction in the cost per kW/hr. at the cell level. 
                             Even with the reduction the battery cost is forecast to add to production costs not 
                             lower them.   
                              
                             Design improvements : The Roadster was built on a conventional chassis  with a 
                             more modular battery, an integrated drive train unit and aluminum body (vs. hand

                                    production  in-house  is  an  easy  margin  enhancement  but  how  they  determine 
                                    whether to source components vs. building them in-house will also play a role in 
                                    potential cost reductions.   
                                     
                                    Fixed cost absorption : How Tesla can achieve economies of scale will play a crucial 
                                    role in its ability to reduce costs.  We estimate that Tesla must produce at least 15K 
                                    units annually to achieve purchasing discounts and reach operating profitability.   
                                     
                                    Battery cost and ZEV credits are primary margin differences.   Tesla has 
                                    indicated they believe they can achieve EBIT margins ~13-15% EBIT margins, vs. 
                                    auto   OEMs   typically   between   5-8%.      So   a   company   that   has   never   mass 
                                    manufactured  vehicles  is  now  going  to  produce  a  luxury  vehicle  with  ~2x  the 
                                    industry’s operating margins?  We believe the primary cost advantage will stem 
                                    from Tesla’s ability to drive down battery cost.  In exhibit 4 we break down the 
                                    expected cost structure for the Model S against a conventional luxury sedan.

                                    The primary difference for the component costs are the engine vs. electric motor 
                                    and battery cost.  Our estimate uses a battery cost $400 kW/hr. assumption, which 
                                    admittedly is higher than the ~$300 kW/hour that Tesla estimates.  While it is true 
                                    that Tesla is not burdened with traditional OEM legacy cost structures but also 
                                    lacks  their  scale  advantages  in  the bill  of  material  costs.    However,  the  margin 
                                    difference arises primarily from the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit.  Without it

                                 complexity, somewhat offset by the difference between paying for greater electricity 
                                 usage versus the absence of a gas bill.  For example, we were quoted two auto 
                                 insurances rate for our “hypothetical” Roadster at 4-5x our own $45,000 MSRP 
                                 sedan ($109K Roadster is only 2.4x more expensive).   
                                  
                                 Range : One of the main arguments in favor of EV adoption is that the ~80% of 
                                 daily car usage is under 40 miles and therefore, a lack of range versus conventional 
                                 vehicles is largely negated.  However, we find two problems with that argument.  
                                 First,  there  is  a  decided  lack  of  infrastructure  (electric  charging  stations  at  gas 
                                 stations) once a user leaves their home.  The workplace infrastructure is not yet 
                                 available nor is there the retail distribution of fuel as for conventional vehicles.  We 
                                 believe that at a minimum the primary pace for charging one’s EV will be the home, 
                                 and to a lesser extent, the workplace, so “range anxiety” is a very real hindrance to 
                                 EV adoption.  Tesla’s Roadster achieves ~245 miles of range on a single charge and 
                                 one version of the Model S is expected to achieve up to 300 miles, which does help 
                                 mitigate  some  of  these  range  limitations  but  at  a  far  higher  price  point  that

                          Tesla sources ~2,000 parts from 150 suppliers.  When they were developing the 
                          Roadster  the  company  did  suffer  some  supply  issues.    Tesla’s  small  size  likely 
                          pushed the company to the back of the line.  Delays in sourcing parts could push 
                          out the introduction of the Model S, which is critical to Tesla’s future growth.  It is 
                          difficult to gauge whether Tesla is ahead or behind on its targets for the Model S 
                          since they do not provide reservation figures on a quarterly basis.  In addition the 
                          more important development and production targets are fairly vague.

                          Tesla  has  no  experience  with  mass  production .  Tesla  has  never  mass 
                          produced automobiles.  They have sold a very limited number of EVs since first 
                          introducing the Roadster in 2008.  We believe one of the biggest risks for Tesla is 
                          the delivering the Model S and next-generation models on time and at sufficient 
                          volumes to produce positive gross margins. Currently potential customers reserve a 
                          yet-to-be  produced  Model  S  by  paying  a  reservation  deposit.    In  mid-2009  the 
                          original timeline to deliver the Model S was by the end of 2011, so Tesla has already 
                          missed one date.  We calculate a delay of one year in introducing the Model S could 
                          cost $300M in cash flow.    
                           
                          The  commitment  to  building  the  model  S  increases  the  capital  base, 
                          raises  capital  intensity  and  makes  Tesla  closer  to  traditional  OEMs 
                          (more   than   management   may  believe).   Tesla   spent   ~$100M   to   develop  the 
                          Roadster  and  expects  to  spend  ~$400M  to  develop  the  Model  S.    Part  of  that 
                          expenditure  is  for  in-house  manufacturing.    In  May  2010,  Tesla  purchased  the 
                          former  NUMMI  (New  United  Motor  Manufacturing)  plant  in  Fremont,  CA  for 
                          $42M and $17M in equipment.  NUMMI was established at the site of a former 
                          General  Motors  Fremont  Assembly  site  that  closed  in  1982.  GM  and  Toyota 
                          reopened the factory as a joint venture in 1984 to manufacture vehicles to be sold 
                          under both brands. The joint venture ended in 2009  as GM pulled and several 
                          months later Toyota announced plans to pull out as well. GM wanted to learn about 
                          lean manufacturing from Toyota and Toyota gained its first manufacturing base in

                           Automobile start-ups have failed with regularity  
                           Automotive OEMs face a capital intensive hurdle as designing, manufacturing and 
                           selling  vehicles  is  inherently  so.    Automobile  production  requires  substantial 
                           investments  in  manufacturing,  equipment,  R&D,  product  design,  engineering, 
                           technology  and  marketing  in  order  to  meet  both  consumer  preferences  and 
                           regulatory requirements. Large OEMs are able to benefit from economies of scale 
                           by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and 
                           models.  The automotive industry is also cyclical and tends to track changes in the 
                           general economic environment. OEMs that have a diversified revenue base across 
                           geographies  and  products  and  have  access  to  capital  are  well  positioned  to 
                           withstand industry downturns and to capitalize on industry growth. The largest 
                           automotive OEMs are GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford, all of which operate on a 
                           global basis and produce cars and trucks across a broad range of vehicle segments.  
                           Tesla Motors is not a large OEM, it is a tiny one.  Tesla is the first car company to 
                           go public since Ford in 1952!  There is a reason why so few do so.  It is a very 
                           difficult business to achieve profitability.  Do these names ring a bell?

                           Back-to-the Future , do these name evoke brand names like GM and Ford?  Coke or 
                           Pepsi?  We did not think so either.  Tesla has sold ~1,400 Roadsters to date.  That 
                           figure is about 2 days total production from any major auto OEM so Tesla clearly 
                           lacks its competitors’ selling prowess.   

                           Competition from integrated OEMs is becoming fierce 
                           We believe one of the biggest obstacles for Tesla will be the number of choices auto 
                           consumers face when the Model S becomes available in 2H12.  In exhibit 7 we show 
                           several HEV models and EV models that are slated to be available before the Model 
                           S.  The Model S would have extended range versus all these models but at a higher 
                           price point than most as well.

                                  The  first  all-EV  competitor  to  Tesla’s  Roadster  is  likely  to  be  the  Nissan  Leaf.  
                                  Nissan  was  a  major  beneficiary  of  the  DoE  loan  program  under  the  Advanced 
                                  Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program  .  At the same time that Tesla received 
                                  $465M in loan commitments in January 2010, Nissan (North America) received 
                                  $1.6Bn to retool its Smyrna, Tennessee factory to build EVs and batteries.  We 
                                  believe Nissan has a head start over Tesla.  Nissan has aggressive plans to produce 
                                  mass market EVs as do General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Porsche, etc.   
                                   
                                  The  best  judge  of  future  demand  for  Model  S  is  the  number  of  reservation 
                                  payments.  At the end of 2Q10 and 3Q10 we believe there were ~2,600 and over 
                                  ~3,000 reservations, respectively, approximately 1 ½ years before production is 
                                  slated to begin.  We estimate 5,500 vehicles will be produced in 2012.  Contrast this 
                                  with Nissan’s plans to build 100,000 EVs by 2012.  Not only will the learning curve 
                                  be steep but we simply cannot believe each company they will have similar cost 
                                  structures at such drastically different production output.     
                                   
                                  As  mentioned Nissan  plans  to  build  as  many  as  100,000  vehicles  by  2012  and 
                                  believes it will do so at prices competitive with conventional vehicles (partly by 
                                  leasing the battery pack, which is by far the most expensive component of EVs). 
                                  Nissan has a joint venture with battery maker NEC, and a decade-old alliance with 
                                  France-based Renault (who has long been an industry leaders partnering for EVs

                           On  a  positive  note,  the  newly  passed  tax  cut  extension  bill  includes  a  one-year 
                           extension of a federal tax credit towards the purchase and installation of electric 
                           car charging stations.   ON a negative note the credit was reduced from 50% of the 
                           purchase price up to $2,000 ($50K commercial) to 30% of the cost up to $1,000 
                           (we do not know the commercial rate yet).  The lack of charging infrastructure only 
                           adds to the “range anxiety” some cite as a primary reason that EV adoption will be 
                           slower than expected.  Until a recharging infrastructure is in place we would expect 
                           EVs to be limited to the second car for most households.   

                           Limited addressable customer base 
                           We believe Tesla’s customer base is limited to (1)  luxury vehicle purchasers (2) 
                           progressive, “green-conscious” consumers seeking to bolster a lifestyle image.  One 
                           would need to believe an overwhelming number of the HEV owners would switch 
                           to an EV rather than a hybrid, pay a far higher price than their current automobile 
                           (50-150%   higher),   deal   with   the   lack   of   infrastructure   and   rely   on   a   still 
                           commercially unproven technology (if it breaks, could a mechanic even fix it?).

                                            plant makes 10,00o vehicles per month, which means 1-2 typical auto plants could

                          Lack of brand name (not cache) subjects Tesla to greater risk of 
                          product failure / recalls  
                          In early October 2010 Tesla was faced with a recall of 439 Roadsters with a minor 
                          electrical problem with voltage system.  The mechanical fix was minor and easily 
                          covered under Tesla’s warranty reserve.  We understand that recalls are a cost of 
                          doing business in the automobile industry but with such a small installed base of 
                          Roadsters 439 of out of ~1,400 is almost 33% of their total unit sales.  The effect 
                          while not quantifiable could serve to dent Tesla’s image if such recall become more 
                          common, as could be the case with a mass s produced vehicle such as the Model S.

                          Lockup ends December 27             , unleashing 3x current free floating 
                          shares  
                          On December 27   th
                                             the IPO lock up period ends, which will add ~3x the current free 
                          floating shares.  Free float will be ~55M shares up from ~15M.  While we do not 
                          expect  to  see  massive  selling  pressure  with  so  many  shares  held  by  insiders, 
                          partners and employees/directors the mere fact that they are available could add 
                          some selling pressure.   

                          Reasons to Buy 

OEM support 
validates                 OEM support validates technology; could it become marriage? 
technology              One  of  the  strongest  reasons  for  the  bull  case  for  Tesla  is  the  increasing  OEM 
                          support      for      its      battery      packs      and      EV      development.      Tesla      has 
                          relationships/partnerships  with  Toyota  (3%  equity  stake,  joint  development  for 
                          RAV4 model), Daimler (invested $50M in 2009, battery purchaser) and Panasonic 
                          (1.5%   equity   stake,   powertrain   development).      Additional   OEM   partnerships 
                          and/or battery purchases would add scale, revenue growth and enhance market 
                          acceptance  of  Tesla’s  technology  and  system  design.    However,  we  believe  the 
                          ultimate reason to buy Tesla is its attractiveness as an acquisition candidate.  So 
                          many Silicon Valley companies see this route as the ultimate goal.  Any of the three 
                          OEMs highlighted below could be potential takeover candidates.   
                           
                          Toyota  investment :  Toyota  invested  $50  million  in  Tesla  in  May  2010  (2.9M 
                          common  shares  or  3%+  equity  stake)  and  has  since  invested  another  $60M  to 
                          partner with Tesla in developing an all-electric powertrain for its RAV4 small SUV. 
                           
                          Panasonic  investment :  Japanese  electronics  giant  Panasonic  invested  $30M  in 
                          Tesla  to  jointly  develop  powertrains  for  1.4M  shares  or  a  1.5%  equity  stake.  
                          Panasonic currently manufacturers batteries for gasoline HEVs.  Tesla currently 
                          uses Panasonic battery cells (and cells from other OEMs), in its battery modules 
                          and has collaborated with Panasonic in developing next generation power packs, 
                          along with potential joint marketing efforts.  We believe Panasonic is positioning 
                          itself  as  a  top  supplier  of  batteries  for  EVs  and  PHEVs  vehicles.  It  has  a  joint 
                          venture with Toyota (called Primearth EV Energy), to make nickel-metal hydride 
                          and lithium ion batteries.  Panasonic just completed its merger with rival Sanyo 
                          Electric  this  month,  another  major  manufacturer  of  nickel-metal  hydride  and 
                          lithium ion batteries. So Panasonic’s investment could be both a blessing and a 
                          curse if Panasonic is able to eventually use its size and scale to cut costs for its own 
                          lithium ion batteries in larger form factors.

                            close to depleting its cash position, providing a nice return on investment.  Daimler 
                            is  using  Tesla’s battery in  its  Smart fortwo  EV program  and  is  expected  to  use 
                            Tesla’s battery packs and chargers for its A-class fleet expected to be introduced in 
                            Europe sometime in 2011.  However, the battery pack technology may not be as 
                            important   as   Tesla’s   experience   using   them   in   EVs,  specifically   the   battery 
                            management, charging technology and electric powertrain engineering.  Daimler 
                            already holds a 49.1% share in Li-Tek, a battery subsidiary of the German firm 
                            Evonik, in a joint venture called Deutsche Accumotive.  Daimler is working on both 
                            electric battery and hydrogen fuel cell technology.   

                            Low cost of battery pack is a competitive advantage – for now 

                            The   biggest   drawback   to   establishing   electric   vehicles   has   always   been   the 
                            electricity storage – the battery.  The key technological development has been to 
                            deliver greater energy and power density (amount of energy that can be stored per 
                            unit of weight / volume), at an acceptable consumer cost.  Typical battery solutions 
                            (lead  acid,  nickel  cadmium,  nickel  metal  hydride)  have  improved  their  energy 
                            densities but not enough to significantly improve driving range (mass of vehicles 
                            meant  batteries  had  to  be  huge).    Lithium-ion  technology  has  emerged  as  the 
                            primary method of lessening (but not yet eliminating) the storage problem.   
                             
                            The most exciting part of Tesla’s story is its battery technology.  Unlike its primary 
                            competitors  (ENER1,  A123  and  BYD)  that  use  large  form  factors  and  different 
                            chemical compositions, Tesla’s uses 6,831 “18650” cells typically used in consumer 
                            electronics products which in total has a mass of ~1,000 lbs..  18650 refers to the 
                            ubiquitous  form  factor  most  consumer  electronics  devices  utilize  per  cell  (a 
                            cylindrical 18mm diameter X 65mm length; just larger than AA battery). Tesla’s 
                            proprietary  cathode  geometry  and  different  chemical  compositions  allow  their 
                            batteries  to  have  greater  energy  density  at  lower  costs.    Competitors’  advanced 
                            automotive (large from factor) batteries achieve energy densities ~150-160 watt 
                            hours per kilogram (wh/kg) versus Tesla’s consumer electronics type batteries at 
                            ~220-230 wh/kg (cell level not pack level).  The cost difference is $100-$150 per 
                            kW/hr ($350-400 for advance automotive vs. $250 kW/hr. for Tesla’s).  These two 
                            main advantages allow for a lower BOM and better performance, all else equal.

                           We estimate the current battery pack for the Roadster (53kW/hr.) is ~$25-$26K 
                           (minimum 1K units annually) which equates to ~$475 kW/hr. versus competitor at 
                           $625-$650 kW/hr. on higher unit volumes (over 10K units annually).   

                           Model S reservations (pre-orders) exceed expectations 

                           Given that the Model S launch is ~18 months away at the earliest the closest way to 
                           determine  demand  is  through  reservations.    If  Tesla  can  demonstrate  it  has 
                           reservations equal to or above the expected 5,000-6,000 for 2012 and/or 19,000-
                           20,000 unit sales forecast for 2013 then investors will likely see this as evidence 
                           that Tesla will exceed expectations, providing a boost for the stock.   

                           Government support for EVs is strong but also highlights lack of 
                           profitability 

                           EVs  do  receive  support  from  several  government  entities  including  federal  and 
                           state incentives.  The most prominent is the $7,500 federal credit (direct subsidy) 
                           for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles.  We have identified another 20 federal 
                           programs that offer tax rebates, loan guarantees and cash grants for EVs.  There are 
                           numerous state incentives as well.  For example California has enacted ~29 laws to 
                           promote  EV  adoption  from  tax  incentives  for  electric  charging  infrastructure 
                           development  to  mandating  state  purchase  of  EVs  after  commercial  availability.  
                           California’s Air Resources Board has a zero emission vehicle (ZEV) policy aimed at 
                           promoting zero tailpipe emissions over time.   
                            
                           Current Energy Secretary Stephen Chu just announced up to $184M for advanced

                           technologies required to achieve large scale adoption of advanced vehicles such as 
                           PHEVs and EVs. Although the first of a new generation of electric drive vehicles is 
                           now  entering  the  market,  advancements  in  batteries,  power  electronics,  and 
                           lightweight   materials   are   required   to   be   fully   competitive.      The   funding

                             development.  The assembled team does have a diverse set of skills from aerospace 
                             design    to    retail    sales    to    more    traditional    automotive    engineering    and 
                             manufacturing.  We have one concern that CEO Elon Musk appears to be a serial 
                             entrepreneur and there is a risk that he moves onto a new venture once the Model S 
                             is launched.  He also currently fills the dual roles as CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX.

                             A glance at Tesla - focus on EVs and battery packs 

                              
                             Tesla’s two operating segments are electric vehicles and powertrain components, 
                             mainly battery packs and some engineering services.

                             Tesla focus on designing, manufacturing and selling electric-only vehicles geared 
                             for the high performance luxury market.  The company introduced the hand-built 
                             carbon fiber Roadster in 2008 and also offers an upgraded and slightly redesigned 
                             model  called  the  Roadster  Sport.  As  with  the  original  Roadster,  there  is  quick 
                             acceleration to a top speed of 125 mph. However, the Roadster Sport reaches 0-to-
                             60  mph  in  an  extremely  quick  3.7  seconds (versus 3.9  seconds)  with the  same 
                             liquid-cooled  53  kWh  lithium-ion  battery  pack.    This  288  hp  two-seater  fully 
                             charges in 3.5 hours via a 240 volt /70 amp charger using any 120 volt outlet. Both 
                             the original Roadster and the Roadster Sport use Lotus Elise bodies built in the UK.

Advantages of Tesla’s battery pack : 
   1.   Cheaper pack since they use generic cells / form factors - Currently most 
       major battery manufacturers such as Panasonic/Sanyo, Sony and LG make 
       the 18650 form factor.  This helps Tesla keep costs down and they can seek 
       out multiple bids to keep suppliers honest. 
   2.   Improved range – the cost advantage enables longer range vehicles  
   3.   Sleeker design – the flat, modular design of the pack may add to vehicle 
       stability 
 
Disadvantages of Tesla’s battery pack : 
   1.   Complexity  increases  -  Tesla’s  choice  in  using  smaller  cells  adds  some 
       complexity to the battery pack.  The cell’s state of charge must be optimized 
       suing software while an active cooling system keeps it from overheating.   
   2.   There is also a greater potential for failed cells  (although this minimizes 
       battery underperformance vs. large form factors, especially as the Model S 
       pack has a higher energy density.     
 
As we discussed earlier a major reason for Tesla to gain profitability is to achieve 
strong gross margins on its Model S production.  The key drivers in the (projected) 
~ 30% battery pack cost reductions (to $300 kW/hr. from today’s ~$475kW/hr) 
are as follows:

   1.   Pack and cell level improvements  – 35-40% higher pack densities and 10-
       15% higher energy density (cell chemistry changes from lithium cobalt to 
       nickel cobalt aluminum lowers cobalt use and it is very expensive vs. nickel 
       and aluminum).  
   2.   Economies of scale  – 20x greater production volumes = improved fixed cost 
       absorption 

EV Basics 

Electricity can be used as a transportation fuel to power battery electric vehicles 
(EVs).  EVs  store  electricity  in  an  energy  storage  device,  such  as  a  battery.  The 
electricity  powers  the  vehicle's  wheels  via  an  electric  motor.  EVs  have  limited 
energy storage capacity, which must be replenished by plugging into an electrical 
source. 
 
In an EV, a battery or other energy storage device (e.g. fuel cell) is used to store the 
electricity that powers the motor.  Some EVs have onboard chargers; others plug 
into a charger located outside the vehicle. Both types use electricity that comes 
from   the   power   grid.   Although   electricity   production   may   contribute   to   air 
pollution, EVs are considered zero-emission vehicles because their motors produce 
no exhaust or emissions. 
 
In  contrast,  hybrid  electric  vehicles  (HEV)  combine  the  benefits  of  high  fuel 
economy   and   low   emissions   with   the   power,   range,   and   convenience   of 
conventional diesel and gasoline fuels.  HEV technologies also have potential to be 
combined  with  alternative  fuels  and  fuel  cells  to  provide  additional  benefits. 
Typically HEVs combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle 
with the battery and electric motor of an EV. The combination offers low emissions 
and convenience as HEVs never need to be plugged in . 
 
How  does  a  hybrid  electric  vehicle  work?  Hybrid  electric  vehicles  are 
powered by two energy sources (1) an energy conversion unit (such as an ICE or 
fuel cell) and an energy storage device (such as batteries or ultracapacitors). The 
energy conversion unit can be powered by gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, 
hydrogen or other fuels.  
 
How does a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) work? A plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicle (PHEV) has two defining characteristics (1) it can be plugged in to 
an electrical outlet to be charged; (2) has some range that can be traveled on the 
energy it stored while plugged in.  PHEVs can be charged with electricity like pure 
electric  vehicles  and  run  under  engine  power  like  hybrid  electric  vehicles.  This 
combination offers increased driving range with potentially large fuel savings and 
emissions reductions.

Differences in powertrain architecture 
The  two  things  that  differentiate  a  PHEV  from  an  HEV  are  the  inclusion  of  a 
charge-depleting operating mode and a recharging plug.  Therefore, a PHEV can be 
implemented using any of the typical HEV architectures – parallel, series or power-
split.  For example we compare and contrast the Chevrolet Volt with the Toyota 
Prius  third  generation  to  show  the  differences  between  series  HEV  and  series 
parallel designs.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.  Considering that ~80% 
of daily driving distances are less than 40 miles, the simplicity efficiency and zero 
emission (in city traffic) of a series design or topology is very attractive. Another 
variation  is  powers-split  hybrids,  which  are  parallel  hybrids.  They  incorporate 
power-split devices allowing for power paths from the engine to the wheels that can 
be either mechanical or electrical. The main principle behind this system is the 
decoupling of the power supplied by the engine (or other primary source) from the 
power demanded by the driver.   
 
Some  controversy  has  recently  surrounded  the  Volt.    We  believe  the  Volt  is 
architected bit differently than originally thought but a little but of mystery still 
surrounds the powertrain architecture.

GM calls it an “electric-plus-gas” system.  The mystery is whether the engine serves 
only to feed the batteries (unconnected to the wheels) and will start up only when 
they need recharging. Or is the gas engine really hooked up to the electric drive 
train?    If  so,  is  it  directly  or  indirectly  connected?    The  Volt’s  150-horsepower 
electric motor is backed up by a 1.4-liter four cylinder engine. However, the gas 
engine has no connection to the drive train. When the Volt reaches its battery range 
of 40 miles, the gas engine generates electricity to drive the electric motor. This 
“extended-range mode” gives the Chevy volt a range  of 344 miles.  In any case 
whether the Volt is an HEV or an EV the fact remains the Volt is now on the market 
and is eligible for the full $7,400 tax credit.

                             credits or other incentives. The average incremental price—the additional price of 
                             an HEV over a comparative non-hybrid—was $5,500 for cars and $6,700 for light-
                             duty trucks in 2009. This price is expected to drop to $1,500 for cars by 2015, 
                             according to a study by Argonne National Laboratory.  Light-duty PHEVs and EVs

                                                 ongoing to reduce cost and improve calendar and life cycle.

                                                 equipment, offer reasonable specific energy and specific power capabilities. 
                                                 Nickel-metal hydride batteries have a much longer life cycle than lead-acid 
                              Nickel-Metal       batteries and are safe and abuse tolerant. These batteries have been used 
                              Hydride           successfully in all-electric vehicles and are widely used in hybrid electric

                                                 high cost, high self-discharge and heat generation at high temperatures, and 
                                                 the need to control hydrogen loss. 
                                                 Lead-acid batteries can be designed to be high power and are inexpensive, 
                                                 safe, and reliable. However, low specific energy, poor cold-temperature 
                              Lead-Acid         performance, and short calendar and life cycle impede their use. Advanced 
                                                 high-power lead-acid batteries are being developed, but these batteries are 
                                                 not currently used in most EVs other than for ancillary loads in some cases. 
                                                 Lithium-polymer batteries with high specific energy, initially developed for 
                              Lithium-          electric vehicle applications, also can provide high specific power for hybrid 
                              Polymer          electric vehicle applications. Like lithium-ion batteries, they could become 
                                                 commercially viable if the cost was lowered and life cycle improved.

                          Where our sell thesis is perhaps weakest is that the strength of EVs derives from 
                          the drive train and battery technology.  We believe Tesla’s OEM investees (Daimler, 
                          Toyota and Panasonic) saw Tesla as an inexpensive way to partake of one leading 
                          battery pack form factor and cost rather than an investment in EVs.  Tesla receives 
                          access to supplier lines at rates lower than they could have without these investees.

                          losses through 2012  

                          Tesla’s  future  may  be  bright  but  it  is  still  almost  two  years  away  from  any 
                          meaningful   revenue   growth   and   probably   three   years  away   from   realistic 
                          profitability.  Tesla is heavily dependent on a successful introduction of the Model 
                          S vehicle for revenue growth and profitability.  So many things have to go right for 
                          Tesla to justify its current valuation.  Look how Tesla is still over 1.5 away from 
                          meaningful revenue growth and operating profitability is over 2 years away.

                          We forecast sales below consensus.  Or thesis that Tesla is attacking a niche market 
                          for luxury vehicles (at least the first Model S model) is the primary reason we see 
                          vehicle sales at lower levels than our competitors  do.  It is not because we are

discounting Tesla’s suggested sales prices for its Model S to any degree. For battery 
pack sales we forecast an ASP of $25K (minimum 1K units) and expect packs sales 
to ramp from 1.125K in 2010 to 3.4K annually in 2015 with minimal ASP erosion.   
  
We  forecast  margins  below  consensus .    We  forecast  lower  gross  margin 
assumptions than the Street consensus.  Our peak gross margins, which do not 
occur  until  2014-2015  are  200-300  bp  lower  than  current  covering  analysts’ 
forecasts primarily due to our belief than Tesla’s EV sales will be below forecasts 
and capital investment higher than expected.  We also believe that Tesla’s decision 
to open and operate its own retail store network adds unnecessary costs and would 
be better served with a distributor approach.  Currently the company has 15 stores 
open and hopes to have stores globally over the next few years.    
 
Zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits .  The ZEV program grants credits to auto 
OEMs that manufacture zero tailpipe emission vehicles. Originally designed by the 
California Air Resources Board and adopted in various degrees by at least 11 other 
states,  ZEV  credits  are  margin-enhancements  for  companies  such  as  Tesla  that 
make ZE vehicles.  Since many states require that each auto OEM that sells vehicles 
in their state must sell a certain percentage of E vehicles, if an OEM cannot do so 
they  could  buy  their  credits  from  Tesla  (partial  credits  are  given  for  hybrid 
vehicles).  Many similar type programs are proliferating in Europe where they have 
actively traded Co2 markets.  Currently the ZEV credit is $7.5K but we expect the 
figure to decline over the net several years.   
 
The balance sheet is cleaner and stronger after the IPO .  The convertible 
preferred stock is gone after the IPO.  The cash position with the DoE loan (see 
below) along with the IPO ($184Min net proceeds) and equity investments from 
various OEMs equals a well-funded company.  Tesla does have significant capital 
commitments now that they have purchased NUMMI’s old factory and we expect 
capex to grow substantially.   
 
DoE loan repayment will not help cash flow .  The DoE loaned Tesla $465M 
in January 2010 under section 136 of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security 
Act (also called the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program).   The 
loan,  technically  a  conditional  loan  commitment,  was  designed  to  aid  Tesla  in 
funding its Model S development and power train business.  The loans are fixed to 
the treasury rates (3%) and Tesla must repay the loans by December 2018.  The 
majority of the loans, $365M, will finance the production facility (purchasing and 
modifying    NUMMI’s    old    plant),    with    the    remaining    $100M    aiding    the 
manufacturing for battery packs and power train development.   
 
Competitor Nissan (Nissan North America) is getting $1.6Bn to retool its Smyrna, 
Tennessee factory to build electric cars and batteries, so Tesla’s competitor got a 
big boost as well.  Should the Model S production ramp be delayed or sales fall 
short of estimates then Tesla must begin to repay the DoE loan starting in 4Q12.  
The $465M loan calls for $13M quarterly payments beginning in 4Q12.

Valuation – losses through 2013 make comparables 

difficult  

We use three different metrics to value Tesla.  Admittedly comparability is difficult 
since we forecast Tesla will continue to deliver net losses for several years.  We use 
enterprise  value (EV)-to-sales  and  EV-to-EBITDA  and  a  5-year discounted  cash 
flow (DCF) to value Tesla.  The average of the enterprise value multiples and our 
discounted cash flow analysis yields our $22 target price.  
 
    1.   EV-to-Sales and EV-to-EBITDA multiples 
 
We believe Tesla deserves a premium multiple to its peer group but we believe the 
stock more than reflects such a premium.  Given the company’s leading battery 
technology and first-to-market advantage we believe the shares should trade at a 
premium to its peer group.  We define Tesla’s peer group as automotive OEMs, 
battery companies, and applied technology companies.  With Tesla potentially at 
the forefront of its growth trajectory we assign a 50% premium multiple to its peer

INVESTMENT RISK 

Tesla faces intense competition from established auto OEMs, execution risk for 
Model S, lack of widespread EV adoption, potential reduction in government 
support and continued operating losses.   
 

VALUATION METHODOLOGY 

We value TSLA using 3 metrics - EV/S, EV/EBITDA and a 5-year DCF. Our $22 
target price is the average relative multiples and our DCF - using 15x terminal 
EBITDA multiple and 14% WACC.
