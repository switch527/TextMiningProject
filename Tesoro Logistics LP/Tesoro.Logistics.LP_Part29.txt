Investment Thesis

TLLP is currently our top pick within our MLP coverage. We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100%
fee-based  (low-risk)  MLP  with  significant  dropdown  and  organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit
distribution growth CAGR for the next several years as TLLP expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large
crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that provides exposure to Bakken formation growth. We believe the Bakken is
in the very early stages of development and that TLLP provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation

Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3-5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2015.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisitions
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.
