       European presence growing and planned expa nsion in APAC this year, we believe 
       Tangoe will begin to have a well-diversified revenue base over the next 2-3 years. 
       Anomalous Networks acquisition brings key technology 
       Tangoes $3.5m acquisition of Anomalous Networks brings key new functionality 
       of real-time TEM (rTEM) that allows users  to be alerted to potential bill-shock 
       before it happens.  Tangoes traditional pr  oducts havent been able to do that, 
       except through the mobile device mana gement product that might simply block 
       usage of the device based on certain ru         les.  rTEM software installed on each 
       device and monitored centrally can alert  users as they approach their voice/data 
       limits, a particularly useful enhancement in the era of smartphones and tiered data 
       plans.  
       Reiterate Buy    , raising PT to $20 from $18; risks       
       We adjust our estimates for FY12-13 based on guidance (see summary of 
       estimate changes on page 3).  Our $20 price target is based on a CY13 uFCF/share 
       estimate of $0.51 (from $0.48), an EV/uFCF/ G multiple of 1.2x (slight premium to 
       the group for market leadership), and an   estimated five-year growth rate, net of 
       dilution, of 30%. Risks include execution risk from integrating acquisitions, delayed 
       profitability from new projects not ramp        ing fast enough and customers taking 
       expense processing in-house after early gains from Tangoe's platform.

                                4Q Review 

                                Beat on revenue and EPS; guidance leaves headroom 

                                Tangoe reported 4Q11 revenue/EPS of $29.2m/$0.  08 vs. our/consensus of $28.1m/$0.07.  
                                Adjusting for one-time and in  organic contribution, the effe ctive revenue beat was about 
                                $550k, equating to organic revenue growth of 26% y/y, about 27% on recurring revenue.  
                                FY12 guidance of $138m at the midpoint implies 14% organic growth, we believe leaving 
                                room for outperformance as recent momentum points to >20% organic growth.  We 
                                reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $20 from $18. 

                                Key metrics: 
                                     Cash balance at the end of FY11 was $43.4m vs. $52.5m at the end of 3Q11.  $14m was 
                                     paid out for the Profitline acquisition. 
                                     Cash flow from operations was $4.8m in       4Q11 vs. $1.2m  in   4Q10 and $1.7m last 
                                     quarter. 
                                     1Q12 Guidance: Revenue of $32.2m to $        32.7m and EPS of $0.08 vs. our previous 
                                     estimate of $32.8m/$0.09 and consensus of $31.6m/$0.08.  
                                     FY12 revenue guidance of $137m-$139m         and EPS of $0.41-$0.42 vs. our previous 
                                     estimate $137m/$0.39 and consensus of $135.5m/$0.41

                                Business continues to expand with portfolio 
                                The combination of Tangoes organic growth as well as new customers and channels that 
                                came with acquisitions is allowing the company to expand its market presence.  About 2/3 of 
                                direct sales are from new customers, with the remaining third up-sell into the existing 
                                customer base.  Channel contribution has grown to about a quarter of new bookings.  
                                Profitline brought Tangoe into the important  government vertical and a channel partnership 
                                with SAIC.  Telecom expense under manageme nt grew to $16.8bn, up 20% since the mid-
                                2011 IPO and 60% over FY10, helped by the acquisition of HCL and Telwares early in 2011.  
                                With European presence growing and planned         expansion in APAC this year, we believe 
                                Tangoe will begin to have a well-diversified revenue base over the next 2-3 years. 

                                Figure 2 below shows the companys recent or       ganic growth momentum.  We note that 
                                during FY11, our estimates for contribution from  HCL and Telwares ($17 in total) could have 
                                been lower than the actual results.  This lead s to the computed organic rates in the 26-30% 
                                range, 26% in the most recent quarter, being optically inflated and suggesting a slowdown in 
                                FY12, based on conservative guidance of 14%  (implied) organic growth.  HCL and Telwares 
                                both anniversary during 1Q12, wi th roughly $2.7m residual contri bution in the quarter.  We 
                                think the natural organi c growth rate of the business is   over 20%, with organic recurring

sales staff, may take a view that is inconsistent  with that taken in this research report. 
Opinions, estimates and projections in this  report constitute the current judgement of  the author as of the  date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without

As a result of Deutsche Banks March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value 
the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of cert  ain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated 
stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the 
target price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
