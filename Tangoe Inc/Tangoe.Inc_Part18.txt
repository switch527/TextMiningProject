                                                     We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy
                                                     recurring  revenue  growth  (+68%  Y/Y)  and  solid  customer  wins.  The  company
                                                     continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide  fixed/mobile  communications  spend  (now

                                                     M&A  strategy  to  acquire  customers,  geography,  or  technology.  Given  these  solid
                                                     fundamentals  and  an  attractive  valuation  (4.1x  CY12E  recurring  rev.),  we  remain
                                                     buyers.

                                   TNGO: Dancin' To A Solid Quarter; Raising PT to $16

                                   We are raising our PT to $16 from $14 on the heels of a solid 3Q11, led by healthy recurring revenue
                                   growth  (+68%  Y/Y)  and  solid  customer  wins.  The  company  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide
                                   fixed/mobile  communications  spend  (now  manages  ~$15.3B  of  the  ~$425B  CLM  market),  and  we
                                   believe Tango can deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth through a variety of drivers (e.g., greenfield
                                   opportunities,  penetrate  spend  at  existing  customers,  international  expansion,  drive  leverage  in  the
                                   model,   deepen   alliances)   for   the   foreseeable   future.   With   the   HCL/Telwares   acquisitions   in   the
                                   rear-view mirror, we expect TNGO to continue its M&A strategy to acquire customers, geography, or
                                   technology. Given these solid fundamentals and an attractive valuation (4.1x CY12E recurring rev.), we
                                   remain buyers.

                                   Delivers   a   solid   3Q. TNGO   posted   3Q11   EPS/rev.   of   $0.07/$27.3M,   vs.   our   estimates   of
                                   $0.06/$26.5M. The healthy results were led by strong subscription rev. growth (up 68% Y/Y to $24.5M)
                                   and  solid  uptake  across  TEM/MDM  products.  We  are  particularly  impressed  with  at  least  ~25-30%
                                   organic rev. growth and 83% adjusted EBITDA growth Y/Y to $3.3M.

                                   Big win at IBM. Tangoe closed a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement at IBM during the quarter.
                                   While we don't expect rev. until FY12, this deal is another signal the company is able to up/cross-sell
                                   its installed base. Separately, TNGO added 25 new customers during 3Q11 (same as in 2Q11).

                                   Expect   more   acquisitions.   TNGO   acquired   five   companies   in   the   past   four   years   to   obtain
                                   technology, customers, and extend its geographic reach. These acquisitions enabled TNGO to develop
                                   and  up/cross-sell  a  holistic  CLM  (communications  lifecycle  management)  suite  to  a  larger  installed
                                   base. Going forward, we expect TNGO to engage in additional tuck-in acquisitions to scale along these
                                   three axes.

                                   Adjusting    estimates. We    now    expect    FY11E    and    FY12E    EPS/rev.    of    $0.25/$103.6M    and
                                   $0.39/$121.3M, from $0.25/$102.0M and $0.38/$117.9M, respectively.

                                   Valuation attractive. At ~$14, TNGO trades at 4.1x CY12E recurring rev. vs. peers at 4.9x. Given the
                                   company's growth prospects, solid revenue visibility, and leverage in the model, we believe it should
                                   trade more in line with peers.

                                   ADBE: Realigns Business Once Again...Plans to Shed 7.5% of Workforce and Shift Model

                                   After the bell yesterday, Adobe announced its plans to realign its business around its Digital Media and
                                   Digital Marketing solutions and to shift more of its business from perpetual license deals to recurring
                                   revenue via its subscription offering. As part of the restructuring, the company intends on eliminating
                                   750 full-time employees (roughly 10% more than its last round of head-count reductions in 11/09) and
                                   materially stepping up its investments in these two digital areas. The company also highlighted that in
                                   order to drive sales and bookings in its digital marketing solutions, it plans on cutting its investments
                                   and license sales from certain enterprise solution product lines. Adobe management stated the impact
                                   from these changes will likely reduce FY12 revenue growth by approximately 4-5%. We note Adobe
                                   now  expects  FY12  revenue  growth  of  4-6%,  below  our  and  Street  forecasts  of  roughly  9%.  Looking
                                   ahead, management believes it can accelerate revenue growth to double-digits in FY13 and beyond.

                                   Along  with  these  changes,  we  expect  Adobe  to  ramp  its  spend  on  its  HTML5  efforts,  focus  on
                                   enhancing  its  digital  publishing  solutions,  invest  in  its  media  monetization  initiatives,  try  to  bring
                                   innovation to its Creative Suite and step up its leadership position in document services. The net result
                                   of  these  actions  and  increased  investments  is  margins  are  likely  flat  in  FY12.  Thus,  while  valuation
                                   appears inexpensive and we believe Adobe's decision to focus on these two large growth areas and
                                   shift its business to a more predictable model could pay off over time, given these efforts will likely take
                                   time to come to fruition, its healthy exposure to Europe and limited margin expansion on the horizon,
                                   we remain on the sidelines.

                                   4Q11 tracking well. Although there are still four weeks remaining in the quarter, we believe ADBE is

on  track  to  at  least  meet  our  estimates  of  $0.59  on  revenue  of  $1091.5  million.  Despite  the  macro
uncertainty, management reaffirmed its 4Q guidance of $0.57-0.64 on revenue of $1075.0-1125.0.

Better  aligning  resources.  Due  to  Adobe's  plans  to  realign  it  resources  around  Digital  Media  and
Digital  Marketing,  it  plans  to  cut  750  full-time  positions,  which  is  anticipated  to  cost  the  company
$87-94M in pre-tax restructuring costs.

Estimates unchanged for now. We are leaving our ests unchanged until we gain additional insight
into ADBE's restructuring and re-alignment plans.

Valuation. At ~$28 in after hours trading, ADBE trades at ~11x our FY12E EPS versus its large-cap
peers  at  ~12.5x.  While  we  don't  anticipate  material  multiple  expansion  any  time  soon,  we  believe
downside is relatively limited.

Mozilla Firefox Now Supports Amazon's Kindle Cloud Reader; Internet Explorer Support Coming

Soon?

Yesterday, Amazon disclosed  its  Kindle  Cloud  Reader  was  now  available  on  Mozilla  Firefox.  The
company's HTML5 based webapp, called Cloud Reader, is a web based e-book reader, which enables
users   to   read   Kindle   books   instantly   in   their   browsers   and   across   devices.   With   this   latest
announcement,  we  note  Amazon's  Kindle  webapp  is  now  available  on Google's Chrome  browser,
Apple's Safari browser and now Mozilla's Firefox browser. We believe Microsoft's Internet Explorer
will  also  likely  support  Amazon's  webapp  shortly,  thus  providing  Amazon  with  coverage  of  most
browsers.

  Price Target Calculation
  TNGO: We arrive at our $16 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.7x multiple to our FY12E recurring revenue of $109.7M. We note
  the software-as-a-service peer group has historically traded at 5-7x next-12-months' recurring revenue. Admittedly, Tangoe is not yet a
  pure SaaS-only shop (its MDM product is delivered via a dedicated hosted or as an on-premise solution but is expected to migrate to
  SaaS architecture by end of next year). We contend that since TNGO's CLM solution is based on a deep technological foundation, the
  "stickiness" of its installed base, the recurring nature of its revenue (strong renewal rates, subscriptions model), its robust growth rates
  (40% five-year CAGR), market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should
  trade roughly in line with its peers, which leads us to our $16 price target.

  Key Risks to Price Target
  TNGO:There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be
  delayed and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected;
  loss of a material customer; increased competition from vendors with larger resources and scale; and the possibility that the company
  will be unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining
  our price target.
