Company Description: 

Tesoro Logistics, L.P. is a publicly traded MLP that owns and operates a crude oil gathering system in the 
Bakken Shale, eight refined products terminals that primarily serve the Western United States market, and 
pipeline and storage assets located in Salt Lake City, Ut ah. The general partner of TLLP is Tesoro Corporation, 
which is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. 
 
Other Q3 Takeaways 
 
     •    TLLP continues to assess drop-down opportunities   and plans to provide an update on its growth 
          initiatives during Tesoro Corp.s (TSO) Analyst an           d Investor Day on Decemb  er 5. In addition to 
          potential acquisitions, management is analyzing pote ntial investments to expand TLLPs footprint in 
          the Bakken and further enhance the utilization of its assets. Notably, our model reflects an assumed 
          $100MM drop-down in Q112 at an EBITDA multiple of 10x. 
 
     •    Crude oil trucking volumes should remain relatively level at approximately 24,000 Bbls/d until 2012. 
          Activity levels in the Bakken is expected to ramp up next year when TLLPs High Plains expansion 
          project is placed into service in Q212. Manageme  nt indicated that there ma y be an opportunity to 
          grow its trucking business as volumes on TLLPs system pick up. 
 
     •    TLLP continues its efforts to secure additional ou  tlet connections between the High Plains System 
          and third-party regional pipelines in the Bakken. The partnership could potentially provide additional 
          volumes to feed into the announced expansions of these pipelines. 
 
 
Q311 Results Ahead Of Expectations 
 
TLLP reported Q311 total EBITDA of $17.7MM, beating our estimate of $14.4MM, consensus of $15.3MM, and 
proforma Q211 results of $13.8MM. Th e variance from our forecast was primarily attributable to higher than 
expected revenues for both the crude oil gathering and terminalling segments and lower than anticipated 
operating expenses. DCF/unit was $0.56, which was also above our estimate of $0.42 due to Q3 operating 
results.  TLLP raised its distribution for the first time   since its IPO to $0.35 per  unit, which was earlier than 
anticipated and above our forecast of $0.34. Q3 distribution coverage was strong at 1.6x (or excess cash flow of 
$6.3MM). The partnership reported EPU of $0.49 versus our estimate of $0.37 and consensus of $0.44.

throughput increased 6% sequentially  as volumes recovered from weather related disruptions experienced in 
Q2 (i.e. from 78, 929 Bbls/d to 83,409 Bbls/d, compared  to our estimate of 80,710 Bbls/d). Average pipeline 
revenue per Bbl increased from $1.24 in Q211 to $1.35 in Q311 (vs. our estimate of $1.25), while trucking 
revenue per barrel increased from $2.86 in Q211 to $2.9  0 in Q311 (vs. our estimate of $2.95). The pipeline 
rate benefitted from a 7% increase (FERC PPI-based adjustment) effective 7/1/11.  
 
Terminalling. Transportation and Storage segment EB                                  ITDA was $11.5MM versus our forecast of $8.3MM. 
Segment operating and maintenance expense of $1.4MM was lower than our estimate of $3.5MM primarily 
due to the inclusion of a $2MM credit for the sale of                             product collected under TLLPs terminal loss allowance 
provision. Management anticipates operating expenses will increase sequentially in Q4 based on an anticipated 
$1MM decrease in the credit. The impact of higher than anticipated terminalling volumes of 144,997 Bbls/d 
(compared to our estimate of 134,579 Bbls/d) more than                                      offset slightly lower than forecasted short-haul 
pipeline throughput (i.e. 69,658 Bbls/d vs. our estimate of 71,395 Bbls/d). Notably,   terminalling volumes from 
third-parties (not TSO) increased sequentially by approximately 1,000 Bbls/d.  
 
TLLP Provides EBITDA Guidance And Project Update 
 
Management expects the partnership will generate                                   annualized EBITDA of $62MM ($15.5MM quarterly) 
excluding the anticipated benefit from announced growth   projects. This forecast was slightly higher than our 
previous Q4 estimate of $14.4MM and compares to our revised forecast of $15.6MM.

Outlook For 2012 
 
For 2012, we forecast TLLP will generate EBITDA of $75.4MM, which represents a 28% ($16MM) 
improvement over proforma 2011 results. The increase in our cash flow estimates is driven primarily by 
contributions from an assumed $100MM drop-down transaction in Q112. Our forecast also reflects the benefit

Raising 2011 DCF Estimate 
 
We are raising our 2011 DCF per unit estimate to $1.81   from $1.65 previously primar ily to reflect Q3 results. 
Our 2011 distribution per unit forecast increases to $1.39 from $1.36 based on the higher than anticipated rate 
declared for Q3. We are also raising our 2012 distribu                                   tion per unit estimate from $1.55 to $1.59, which 
represents a 14.8% year-over-year increase. There is no change to our 2012 DCF per unit estimate of $1.98.

Raising Valuation Range To $26-28 Per Unit 
 
We are raising our valuation range for TLLP by $1 per un                                      it to $26-28 to reflect a slightly higher five-year 
distribution CAGR forecast of 10.0% versus 9.6% previously. Our valuation range is based on: (1) a three-stage 
distribution discount model assuming a 9% required rate of return and a 1.25% long-term growth rate and (2) 
a price-to-distributable cash flow                     multiple of about 13x our 2012 esti                       mate. Risks to TLLP trading in our 
valuation range include: a slower-than-forecasted rate                                 of acquisitions, dependence on TSO, and geographic 
concentration.
