                  only).  The +46% increase in e-commerce sales was                
                  also very solid. 3Q11 EPS of $0.02 was in line with 
                  consensus and $0.01 above our estimate. 

                  What's new:  Stock down 9% likely on inventory 
                  concerns, 2.5% decline in same store transactions, and 
                  decelerating new store productivity (we calculate ~74% 
                  vs. 77% last Q and 82% in 1Q).  We think inventory 
                  concerns (inventory +79% y/y) are overblown as TEA 
                  eliminated the middleman to directly source product, 
                  which requires ownership of inventory earlier in the 
                  supply chain.  

                  Market concerns in declining transactions and 
                  lower new store productivity may be well-founded.  
                  We would have expected consistently positive 
                  transaction growth in an underpenetrated category (tea) 
                  and with such a new store base (196 stores at 3Q11-end  
                  vs. 141 LY at this time and 107 2 years ago).   

                  New store productivity is inline with management 
                  expectations. Existing fleet averages ~$860,000 per 
                  store.  New stores are expected to generate $600,000 - 
                  $700,000 annually, or 70-80% of the existing fleet 
                  productivity.  While our 74% productivity calculation is 
                  inline with management plan they may have fallen short 
                  of market expectations.

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
