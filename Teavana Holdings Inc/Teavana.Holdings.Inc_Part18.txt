                                                     1Q12 store comps may be hovering near flat. Comp volatility has occurred to others in

                                                     A closer look at comps. Much angst centers around Teavana's comps (8.6% in the

                                                     4Q, 4.4% ex. e-comm). This concern is twofold. First, slower comps historically point
           3Q           $0.02     $0.03       --     to a concept nearing saturation. Second, high comps have historically correlated with
           4Q           $0.32     $0.42       --     premium multiples. On the former, we think that Teavana's comps are less indicative
               Prior    $0.31     $0.40       --     of a saturation point; geographic proximity of new stores to existing stores has not
           YEAR         $0.46     $0.59     $0.78    materially changed. Moreover, the recent acceleration of store openings (54 in 2011
               Prior    $0.45     $0.59     $0.79    alone) places some pressure on comp as stores entering the comp base lap the grand
           First Call     --    $0.64E     $0.78E    opening periods. A higher multiple may necessitate accelerating store comps. We also
                                                     take a quick look at valuation within the framework of operating metrics ± see Exhibit 1.

                                                     Growth remains strong. We look at two other drivers of top-line growth: e-commerce
                                                     and new stores. E-commerce growth was a healthy 55% in the 4Q, and drove 420
                                                     bps of total comp. There is incremental opportunity here as online still only represents
                                                     7.6% of total FY11 sales (goal of 10% by 2015). The Company also opened 50 stores
                                                     in 2011, which makes it one of the fastest growing retailers in our coverage. We see
                                                     few reasons why both of the aforementioned should slow in the near to medium term.

                                                     Timing considerations. Store openings will be focused toward the end of 1-3Q,
                                                     which drives higher pre-opening absorption without corresponding revenue. This helps
                                                     capitalize on the 4Q opportunity, but will make it more difficult to externally calculate
                                                     new store productivity.

4Q wrap. TEA posted a 4Q EPS of $0.32, above KBCM and consensus estimates of $0.31. Sales increased 33.6% year-over-year
to $68.4 million and comps were up 8.6% (ex. e-commerce up 4.4%). Inventories increased 51.7% year-over-year. Gross margin
declined -202 bps year-over-year to 65.6%, driven by increased sales of lower-margin, non-tea merchandise. SG&A as a percentage
of sales levered 67 bps to 32.2% and SG&A dollars rose 30.9% to $22.0 million. The Company opened four new stores in 4Q11 and
ended the quarter with 200 stores. Management guided 1Q12 EPS of $0.09-$0.10 and FY12 EPS of $0.58-$0.61.

VALUATION
At 32.9x 2012 P/E, 3.5x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.0x 2012 PEG, valuation is reasonable for a high-growth retailer. We think the
Company can sustain accelerating earnings growth, particularly given its aggressive new store opening program and strong new store
economics. Thus, we think Teavana deserves to trade at a premium to the active and healthy lifestyle peer group average of 31.9x 2012
P/E, 2.2x 2012 EV/Sales and 1.3x 2012 PEG. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a 15.8x 2012 EV/EBITDA compared to 13.2x
EV/EBITDA of the peer group. We maintain our $28 price target, which implies a 47.4x P/E based on our $0.59 2012 EPS estimate.

RISKS
Risks specific to TEA that could impede the stock from reaching our upside price target include but are not limited to the
following: ability to identify suitable locations to open new stores, a change in consumer spending behavior, and retention of senior
management.

         LOOKING FORWARD 
         Long-term operating margin opportunity. Looking forward, we expect SG&A rate to de-leverage in 1H12, which will be offset 
         on an annual basis by leverage in 2H12. Additionally, gross margin is expected to remain flat in FY12, resulting in a flat operating 
         margin. Looking beyond 2012, we believe gross margin will expand as stores reach maturity and, in the long term, operating 
         margin to expand.  
          
                Expect 200-300 bps of SG&A de-leverage in 1H12. SG&A de-leverage in 1H12 will be the result of comparing the 
                  current company infrastructure to pre-IPO operations. The Company expects to leverage SG&A in 2H12  (mostly in 
                  4Q12) to offset most of the de-leverage from 1H12. 
                Relatively flat gross margin and operating margin. Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year in 
                  FY12  due  to  the  anniversary  of  direct  sourcing  benefits.  Additionally,  a  significant  portion  of  stores  have  recently 
                  opened within the past two years and are operating at lower gross margins. Coupled with a flat SG&A rate for FY12, 
                  operating margins should remain flat year-over-year. 
                Store penetration of high-traffic, domestic malls. There seems to be some runway in store penetration given that 
                  approximately 50 A-mall locations will remain untouched at the end of 2012. With 60 planned store openings including 
                  the first stores outside of the United States, store count should grow to 260 by the end of the year.  
          
         THE KBCM LAUNDRY LIST 
          
                      4Q11 EPS of $0.32 was above KBCM and consensus estimate of $0.31.  
                       
                       
                      Gross margin declined 202 bps to 65.6% and operating margin declined 141 bps to 31.0%. 
                       
                          
                      Inventory levels up 51.7% year-over-year, well above sales growth of 33.6% year-over-year.
