INVESTMENT CONCLUSION 
CHEF reported another quarter of strong growth in both revenue and earnings, 
but it was below consensus. The stock is understandably under pressure on the 
results and trading lower at a higher rate than the reduction in the earnings 
outlook given the momentum that was present in the shares and the premium 
valuation. We view the correction as a healthy one as it reflects the stock, the 
valuation and short-term investor reactions rather than any material fundamental 
change. As such, it provides another opportunity to buy the shares at a discount 
to its best peer and with more modest expectations. Not only is the consensus EPS 
forecast moderating, but likely so is the expectation for upside that was present in 
the shares. We reiterate our BUY rating and recommend investors capitalize on 
what we believe is an attractive buying opportunity. 

THE RESULTS 
CHEF reported EPS of $0.13, compared to the consensus EPS estimate of $0.15. 
Revenue of $98.1M was about $1M below the forecast and was driven by both 
7.3% internal growth and the benefit of three acquisitions over the last 12 
months. Given the shortfall, even as modest as it was, our initial conclusion was 
that sales simply softened in March as one would understand given how the 
landscape has progressed this year. However, it appears that case volume did not 
indicate any change in the growth rate. The shortfall vs. expectations, and likely 
to management’s expectations entering the year, was driven by rapid deflation of 
dairy pricing during the quarter that should have led to slower revenue growth 
later in the quarter than at the onset. While the company held gross margin 
percentage at 26.6%, this of course implies lower gross margin dollar 
contribution. Given we must assume dairy pricing remains at the lower level, we 
are flowing this lower contribution into our remaining F2012 estimates. 
Additionally, the decision to not pursue an existing customer with less favorable 
pricing impacts the forward guidance. As a result of about a $0.02 impact from 
the lower dairy pricing and a $0.02 impact from the customer loss, the company 
lowered the high end of its EPS guidance range to $0.94 from $0.96. The 
guidance change is more modest than the called-out items, and likely benefits 
from a modest offset from the acquisition of Praml in Las Vegas. We are reducing 
our F2012 EPS estimate to $0.91 from $0.95 and our F2013 EPS estimate to 
$1.05 from $1.08 as a result of the recent revenue trends. Our revenue forecast, 
however, is increased to $461.1 million from $456.3 million in F2012 and to 
$514.3 million from $504.2 million in F2013. Our revenue forecast increase 
reflects the acquisition of Praml, which we haven’t forecasted adding to EPS yet.

VALUATION 

Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 19x our 2013 EPS forecast 
and 9x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples generally in the 
low teens on forward earnings and 7 to 8x EBITDA, the valuation is at a discount 
to its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, United 
Natural Foods. We view UNFI as the best comparison for CHEF given it also 
enjoys a naturally growing market, superior margins relative to most distributors 
(yet at 18% UNFI’s gross margins are inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader 
in its segment as is CHEF. We continue to argue that CHEF should trade at a 
premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI does) given its vastly superior margins, 
growth outlook and higher returns on invested capital.  

We maintain our price target of $24.00, which reflects 11x our 2013 EBITDA 
forecast and 22x our 2013 EPS estimate, which is consistent with where CHEF 
currently trades prior to expected share price weakness today and reflects the 
premium valuations of the specialty food peer group.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several years, 
could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major products 
sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, flour, and 
cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact CHEF's 
operations. 

Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as consumer 
confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding incremental 
economic weakness have impacted the performance of the shares. 

Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes with 
larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include Sysco, U.S. 
Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, leaving 
the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 2010, 66% of 
CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and any 
concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in the 
brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always present.  

Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution operations 
require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also subject to 
similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a distributor of 
specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing governmental scrutiny of 
and public awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging and 
marketing of natural and organic products 

Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability to 
profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could result 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   69

the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 
In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing.
