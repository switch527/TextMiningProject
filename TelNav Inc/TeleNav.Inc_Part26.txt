                                      •  We are lowering estimates with this note.   Specifically, we are cutting back the 
                                        auto-related royalties (e.g., Ford) by nearly 50% in calendar 2011; we think the 
                                        revenue ramp was too aggressive.  We have also cut back the ad-based revenue 
                                        ramp; this is an early-stage opportunity a nd we believe the bar should be set low.  
                                        We have also increased R&D slightly to re flect our view that th e firm must invest 
                                        heavily to capture new market opportunities.  CY11 EBITDA goes to $36 million 
                                        from $41 million, and CY12 EBITDA goes to $46 from $62 million. 
                                      •  Key questions for the call.   What percent of revenue will the Sprint flat fee 
                                        represent next quarter and beyond? Should the Sprint contract be considered as an 
                                        industry trend and will it affect TNAVs contracts with other carriers? What impact 
                                        is TeleNav seeing from free navigation solutions from Google and Nokia? How 
                                        are the Auto and TeleNav Track growth   initiatives proceeding, and what are the 
                                        latest expectations?  When can we e       xpect to see meanin  gful growth from 
                                        international markets, particularly at China Mobile?

                                        undervalued, in our view, but we belie ve TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                        better clarity on the business model and its  drivers (particularly at Sprint). We are 
                                        incorporating a two-turn reduction in the EV/EBITDA multiple assumption for our 
                                        December 2011 price target, reflecting our   view of increased competition from 
                                        Android handsets and lower CY12 estimates.

                                    Valuation and Rating Analysis 

                                    Maintain Neutral, meaning that we expect the stock to perform in line with the 
                                    mean of our coverage universe in the next 6-12 months.  The stock is still 
                                    undervalued, in our view, but we believe TNAV will not outperform until we get 
                                    better clarity on the business model and its drivers (particularly at Sprint).  

                                    Our December 2011 price target of $7.00 is based on an assigned multiple of 5x 
                                    CY12E PF EBITDA of $46.3mm, lowered from 7x. Our multiple assumption is 
                                    based on the comms software/services peer group current median multiple of ~7x, 
                                    but with a discount that takes into consideration recent significant shifts in the 
                                    competitive landscape (Android gaining market share in handsets, TomTom gaining 
                                    share in autos).   

                                    Although our estimates are lowered, our December 2011 price target remains 
                                    unchanged at $7.00. This is because we have corrected an error in our price target 
                                    calculation in which we failed to add back TNAVs net cash position of $113mm 
                                    into our market cap calculation.  With this adjustment and the decrease in our CY12 
                                    EBITDA estimate, our 2011 price target remains at $7. Based on the correct market 
                                    cap ($546mm), our price target in our September 21st TeleNav note would have been 
                                    $12.00, based on a 7x multiple assumption on CY12E PF EBITDA of $61.9mm. 

                                    Risks to Our Rating and Price Target 

                                    We could become more constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the 
                                    following reasons: 
                                         •   TeleNav experiences faster subscriber growth than we anticipate 
                                         •   Telenav wins new customer contracts that spur subscriber growth 
                                         •   New applications and features allow TNAV to stabilize or increase ARPUs 
                                             and gross margins. 
                                         •   Telenavs growth initiatives, including MRM, Ad-based 
                                             navigation/mcommerce, Auto OEM solutions, accelerate ahead of 
                                             expectations. 
                                         •   Free navigation solutions providers, such as Nokia or Google, exit the 
                                             market or reduce their commitment 
                                         •   TNAV reduces expenses relative to our expectations without compromising 
                                             growth prospects, leading to higher margins than we anticipate. 
                                    We could become less constructive on TNAVs prospects for any of the following 
                                    reasons: 
                                         •   Sprint terminates the relationship with TNAV or renegotiates terms that 
                                             reduce revenues to TNAV, relative to our expectations 
                                         •   AT&T, T-Mobile or other TNAV customers do not roll over contracts with 
                                             TNAV, or reduce pricing. 
                                         •   Free navigation from Google, Nokia and Mircosoft captures market share 
                                             owing to the handsets on which these solutions are pre-provisioned.  

                                                                                                                     3 

                                                                                                                          196

                                            •   TeleNavs ARPUs and gross margins fall faster than we have anticipated 
                                            •   Subscriber growth falls short of our expectations. 
                                            •   International growth, especially at China Mobile, does not materialize. 
                                            •   The company allows expenses to run up faster than we have forecast, 
                                                leading to lower operating and EBITDA margins than we estimate.

Initiated coverage Jun 22, 2010. This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst
may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.

 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
