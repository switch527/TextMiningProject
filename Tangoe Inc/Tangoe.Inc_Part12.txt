                                   We are raising our price target to $20 from $17 on the heels of a solid 4Q11, led by healthy recurring
                                   revenue  growth  (+61%  Y/Y)  and  new  customer  wins.  Tangoe  continues  to  gain  share  of  worldwide
                                   fixed/mobile communications spend (manages $16.8B of the ~$425B TAM, or total available market),
                                   and recent acquisitions of ProfitLine (on 12/19) and Anomalous Networks (on 1/10) broaden Tangoe's
                                   communications  lifecycle  management  portfolio,  increase  scale,  and  present  additional  up/cross-sell
                                   opportunities. We believe Tangoe can continue to deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth through a
                                   variety of drivers (e.g., greenfield opportunities, penetrate existing customers, international expansion,
                                   leverage  in  the  model,  deepen  alliances,  proliferation  of  mobile  devices)  for  the  foreseeable  future.
                                   Given these solid fundamentals and an attractive valuation (~3.8x CY13E rev.), we remain buyers.

                                   Tangoe reported 4Q11 non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.08/$29.2M, topping its guidance and
                                   our  $0.07/$28.3M  forecast,  with  strength  across  the  board. Tangoe  posted  recurring  revenue  of
                                   $25.8M (up 61.3% Y/Y), and services revenue grew a healthy 28.5% Y/Y to $3.5M (we note services
                                   revenue  included  $250K  of  one-time,  non-recurring  revenue).  We  are  pleased  to  see  the  company
                                   deliver another quarter of mid-twenties organic recurring revenue growth and retention rates remain in
                                   the mid-90 percent range.

                                   Tangoe closed 22 new customers during the quarter (vs. 25 new logos last quarter) and continues to
                                   displace  competitors  and  home-grown  systems.  We  note  that  Tangoe  typically  signs  between  20-30
                                   new customers a quarter. While the new customer count was lower than last quarter's, management
                                   notes  that  the  average  transaction  size  was  almost  25%  larger).  It  is  clear  to  us  that  Tangoe  is
                                   executing  on  its  plan  to  increasingly  drive  CLM  spend  through  its  platform,  with  total  spend  under
                                   management  now  at  $16.8B,  up  60%  (and  up  54%  ex-ProfitLine).  Given  low  penetration  rates  at
                                   existing  customers  (~33%  penetrated)  and  a  large  greenfield  opportunity  (~80%  of  companies  use
                                   home  grown  systems),  we  expect  Tangoe  to  continue  driving  spend  through  its  platform  for  the
                                   foreseeable future.

                                   Consolidating the space. Tangoe is proving to be a skilled consolidator, and we believe M&A is one
                                   of the company's core competencies (Tangoe acquired seven companies over the past five years). As
                                   a  reminder,  Tangoe  acquired  ProfitLine  on  12/19/2011.  One  of  the  largest  CLM  vendors  behind
                                   Tangoe,  ProfitLine  provides  scale  and  entry  into  the  Federal  vertical  market  (25%  of  ProfitLine's
                                   business is gov't). ProfitLine operates in both the fixed and mobile space, and the vast majority of the
                                   company's 50 customers did not use both products. Further, ProfitLine was primarily US-focused. We
                                   believe  Tangoe  has  a  large  opportunity  to  up/cross  sell  additional  modules  as  well  as  penetrate
                                   international  CLM  spend  at  legacy  ProfitLine  customers.  Last,  ProfitLine  brings  healthy  partnerships
                                   with HP and SAIC (system  integrators).  Recall  strategic  alliances  are  a  key  component  of  Tangoe's
                                   go-to-market strategy, as they contribute about 25% of new annual recurring revenue (Tangoe also has
                                   alliances  with IBM, Dell, HPQ, and Xerox).  ProfitLine  contributed  about  $500K  in  revenues  during
                                   4Q11 and is expected to bring in $14-15M during FY12.

                                   Tangoe  on  1/10/2012  acquired  Anomalous  Networks,  a  leading  provider  of  real-time  TEM  (rTEM)
                                   solutions.  Unlike  Tangoe's  legacy  CLM  solutions  that  monitor  telecom  expense  compliance  upon  bill
                                   receipt,   Anomalous'   rTEM   technology   monitors   mobile   device   activity   at   the   "actual   point   of
                                   consumption" to proactively management telecom expenses and reduce "bill shock." In other words,
                                   the real-time nature of rTEM enables companies to provide enhanced visibility into telecom spend and
                                   better manage its communications assets. While we do not expect significant revenue contribution from
                                   rTEM this year (~$1M in revenue), we believe rTEM is an emerging technology that is complementary
                                   with Tangoe's CLM portfolio and provides up/cross-sell opportunities, over time.

                                   Leverage in the model. The integration of HCL and Telwares (both acquired during 1Q11) is well on
                                   track. Recall that HCL/Telwares operated at lower gross margins than Tangoe, which have served as a
                                   short-term  drag  to  overall  margins  (gross  margin  dropped  to  52.9%  at  4Q11  from  57%  at  4Q10  --
                                   management notes gross margin ex-HCL/Telwares would have been higher in 4Q11 than in 4Q10). It

typically takes Tangoe 12-18 months to fully transition acquired clients to its CLM platform (from the

acquired platform), and we expect HCL/Telwares to be no different. During 4Q11, Tangoe ramped up

its customer migrations which should be completed over the next few quarters. As a result, we expect

gradual   margin   expansion   over   the   course   of   this   year   (despite   the   ProfitLine   acquisition)   and

anticipate  Tangoe  to  successfully  up/cross-sell  legacy  HCL/Telwares  customers  upon  migration.  We

think management's goal of 55% gross margin at the end of FY12 is quite achievable.

Regarding  the  macro  environment, management  highlighted  it  has  not  seen  any  impact  to  its

business  from  macro  headwinds  and  notes  its  pipelines  remain  healthy.  We  believe  Tangoe  is

relatively insulated, should the macro environment further deteriorate since: 1) Tangoe's contracts are

longer-term (while contracts range from 2-5 years, the typical contract runs 2-3 years); and 2) Tangoe's

TEM  and  MDM  solutions  drive  ROI,  improve  efficiencies,  and  reduce  compliance/regulatory/security

risks,  all  of  which  provide  an  additional  layer  of  "stickiness"  (ie,  loyalty/reluctance  to  switch).  As  a

reminder, Tangoe delivered >20% organic recurring revenue growth during the '08/09 recession.

Altogether,  we  continue  to  believe  the  CLM  market  is  still  in  its  earliest  stages  of  growth,  as

enterprises are just beginning to address the need to centrally manage a disparate inventory of fixed

and  mobile  assets.  This  segment  should  only  increase  in  importance  as  enterprises  connect  mobile

devices  (smartphones,  tablets)  to  the  corporate  network  at  an  accelerating  pace.  As  a  result  of  this

growing  complexity,  we  believe  companies  will  begin  to  move  off  outdated,  home-grown  systems  to

effectively manage telecom resources. Given Tangoe's leadership position in the CLM space (Tangoe

is more than three times larger than its nearest competitor and is the only player to combine TEM/MDM

in  one  solution)  and  a  healthy  moat  (ie,  barriers  to  entryTangoe's  CLM  solution  supports  16

languages, 125 currencies, 200 countries/territories, 1,900 billing formats, 1,700 carriers globally, and

was  awarded  12  patents),  we  believe  the  company  should  be  able  to  effectively  capture  this  large

opportunity and deliver double-digit EPS/revenue growth for the foreseeable future.

Tangoe's Revised Outlook

Tangoe introduces 1Q12 and FY12 estimates. For 1Q12, Tangoe expects EPS of $0.08 on revenue

of $32.2-32.7M. Tangoe also guides 1Q12 Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5-3.7M, taxes of $200K, and 39M

shares outstanding.

For FY12, Tangoe expects EPS of $0.41-0.42 on revenue of $137-139M. Tangoe also guides FY12

Adjusted EBITDA of $19.5-20M, taxes of $1M, and 39.5M shares outstanding. Management expects

FY gross margin to be 55% for the FY, with lower margins in the first half of the year and increasing as

the year progresses.

Changes to our Model

Following TNGO's solid 4Q11 results and revised outlook, we've adjusted our model. We now

expect FY12 EPS/revenue of $0.41/$138.6M vs. our prior estimate of $0.43/$135.5M and consensus of

$0.41/$135.5M.    We    also    introduce    FY13    EPS/revenue    of    $0.59/$164.2M    vs.    consensus    of

$0.54/$152.7M. A more detailed breakout of our model changes is contained in the exhibit below:

  Investment Thesis
  n  A leading provider of communications lifecycle management (CLM) solutions
  n  Largest player in a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow
  n  Appears well positioned to sustain double-digit revenue and EPS growth
  n  Multiple  growth  drivers  (greenfield  marketplace,  acquire  new  customers/penetrate  existing  accounts,  international
     expansion, form additional strategic alliances, engage in additional acquisitions)
  n  Leverage in the model

  Price Target Calculation

  We arrive at our $20 price target for Tangoe by applying a 4.5x EV/S multiple to our FY13E revenue of $164.2M. We note the SaaS peer
  group  has  historically  traded  at  5-7x  next-12-months'  revenue.  We  contend  that  since  TNGO's  CLM  solution  is  based  on  a  deep
  technological  SaaS  foundation,  the  "stickiness"  of  its  installed  base,  the  recurring  nature  of  its  revenue  (strong  renewal  rates,
  subscriptions model), its robust growth rates (40% five-year CAGR), market leadership position in an open-ended opportunity, and the
  sizable leverage in its model, Tangoe should trade roughly in line with its peers.

  Key Risks to Price Target

  There  are  several  risks  to  our  investment  thesis,  including  the  sluggish  pace  of  IT  spending,  which  may  cause  deals  to  be  delayed
  and/or downsized; the company's failing to successfully integrate an acquisition; CLM demand not materializing as expected; loss of a
  material  customer;  increased  competition  from  vendors  with  larger  resources  and  scale;  and  the  possibility  that  the  company  will  be
  unable to execute on its growth initiatives. Any of these risks, as well as others unforeseen, could prevent the stock from attaining our
  price target.
