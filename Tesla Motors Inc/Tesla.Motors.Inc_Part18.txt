                    of sales, >$1.2bn of operating profit and >$1.0bn of FCF 
                    by 2020, based on Tesla capturing 3.6% of the global 
                    xEV market by that time.  The risks of lagging EV 
                    adoption, launch delays and balance sheet difficulties 
                    make Tesla a highly speculative investment.

Key Tesla Debates 

Debates                                     Our take 

1.    How big is the global xEV market?     xEV sales to reach 7% of US market and 5.5% of global volume by 2020.  The 
    Market View: Maybe 5% of US sales      death of the internal combustion engine?  Far from it.  We still expect 85% of global 
    and substantially less than 5% of global   car sales to be based on the internal combustion engine in 2025.  We believe it 
    sales by 2020.                           would take the better part of 30 years to have the majority of the worlds cars

2.    Is there room for new entrants into   Electric vehicles represent a disruptive technology that can lead to new

    players die or are gobbled up.            and ramp-up, we think they can be a major player in alternative mobility.    
                                             
3.    How big a player can Tesla be in the  Teslas goal is to be an independent, mass market electric car company

4.    How does one put a value on Tesla?   Must take a long-term view to value Tesla.  The company either succeeds as a

N. American Autos and Auto-Related Industry View:  In-Line.   
    •      Sharp volume recovery expected in N. America driven by pent-up demand, aging car parc and historical 
        recovery patterns.  Financial sub profits boosted by high residual values and improving risk-loss could trigger far 
        greater release of pent-up demand. Dealer network has been rationalized and inventories are still low. 

    •      Industry is in a sweet spot of high capacity utilization and low cost structure due to unprecedented capacity exit 
        and legacy cost reduction. We believe capacity can chase production rather than the other way around in this 
        cycle, leading to higher sustainable margins for the supplier group.   

    •      We prefer secular stories vs. cyclical stories given the markets expectation for a V-shaped volume recovery

Debate 1:  How big is the global xEV market opportunity?

Our view:  PHEV + EV sales to reach 7% of US 
market and 5.5% of global volume by 2020.  The 
death of the internal combustion engine?  Not at all.  We 
expect more than 85% of global car sales to be powered 
solely by an internal combustion engine by 2025.  We 
believe it would take the better part of 30 years to have 
the majority of the worlds cars powered by electrons.   
 

We expect significant adoption of electric vehicles will 
require a full engineering cycle of 10 to 15 years.  Key 
requirements to foster xEV development include:

Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology 
estimates that the number of vehicles in operation in China will 
more than triple by 2020. China currently imports over half of 
its petroleum from overseas.  By 2020, the EIA estimates 75% 
of Chinese oil consumption will be imported.  It is clearly in 
Chinas strategic and national security interest to reduce its 
ever-growing dependence on foreign oil through the use of 
alternative fuel vehicles.

Debate 3:  How big can Tesla be?  

Market View:  A niche player focusing on high-end                  The Tesla factory  Combining Silicon Valley engineering 
electric vehicles and the supply of EV engineering                 with Toyota production know how  
competence and powertrains to larger manufacturers. 
                                                                   Plant Background: The Fremont plant was built and 
Our view:  Teslas goal is to be an independent,                   operated by General Motors between 1962 and 1982 before 
mass market electric car company selling hundreds                  NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc JV between

more than 40k units on our forecasts by 2015.  The                 Tacoma and Corolla. On the capacity front, it is capable of

Tesla is a top-line story driven by their ability to capture a 
modest share of a growing EV market.  We believe our               Teslas purchase covers 210 acres or roughly 55% of the 
assumptions for unit volume by 2020 and 2025 are roughly 3x        available 380 acres of the former NUMMI facility and includes 
higher than consensus, commensurate with our fair valuation        all the manufacturing facility on it. The plant will be home to

assumptions for Tesla include:                                   purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts

next 15 years, with over $18.6bn of revenue by 2025.                         Tesla will have net cash of almost $12bn.

Cost-benefit methodology behind our xEV model.  We have attempted to determine the financial inflection point for operating 
costs, which is one of the objective factors driving our US xEV demand model. We note that several other factors also drive EV 
demand, some of which are more subjective including image, political will etc. These subjective factors could be even more influential 
than the cost factor in determining xEV demand.  For our model, we assume the average car drives 12,000 miles/year and gets 25 
mpg, and we estimate a weekly gasoline consumption of 8-9 gallons/week. We note that US consumers tend to feel the pain of high 
gas prices between $3.50-$4 per gallon. This means the average consumer would be comfortable spending no more than $30 per 
week on gasoline costs. As part of our xEV model, we have tried to maintain the weekly gasoline/electricity spend at $30 per week by 
substituting more PHEVs and EVs in the car fleet, as gasoline prices get to $5, $6 and higher between now and 2025.

                                                   Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                   uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                   regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                   leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                 
                                                   basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                   from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution

For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
