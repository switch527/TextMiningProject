                        •  A central competitive advantage is the low cost of Teslas battery pack,   which                 vivek.x.aalok@jpmorgan.com 
                          should allow it to sell the Model S (2012 launch) at a reasonable price but with a                J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 
                          near-normal (up to) 300 mile range, a combination other EVs have yet to deliver. 
                          We think Tesla Model S battery pack costs will be at/below ~$300/kWh, well below                  Price Performance

                        •  Model S is key.  Launching in mid-2012, we expect the mid-size luxury segment 
                                                                                                                               Jun-10
                          Model S to raise TSLA's revenue from $0. 1B (2010) to $1.8B by 2013. It will be

                          aggressive assumption, in our view, as it represents a 2% share of the BMW 5-series 
                          sedan segment. 2.8k refundable reservations exist now for the Model S. But 
                          competition should eventually arrive, a key reason we assume long-term EBIT 
                          margins of 8-12% vs guidance of 14-16%. 
                        •  Small but different. (1) Efficiency: Tesla spent $100MM on Roadster development 
                          and plans to spend $0.4B on Model S, probably half of what other OEMs are 
                          spending on new PHEVs/EVs. (2)   Distribution: Tesla will own, not franchise, its 
                          dealers, which should result in tighter brand equity/customer experience control. (3) 
                          EV Pure Focus: Tesla does not invest in anything but EV powertrains. This, coupled 
                          with an ability to attract top-notch vehicle engineering talent, should allow Tesla to 
                          address technical challenges better, cheaper, and faster than large global OEMs.  

                        • Set Dec-2011 price target of $25  . Our 2013 EPS ($1.51; $1.15 taxed) assumes 
                          18.5k Model S units and 8.3% EBIT margin (in line with luxury OEMs; guidance is 
                          ~15%). We get to $25 with DCF and p/sales (avg. of BYD, A123 and HEV), though 
                          we do not see positive EPS until 2013 and, as such, TSLA may tread water until 
                          Model S launch becomes more visible (1H.11) and/or reservations increase further.

                                            We estimate that the Model S' battery pack will cost ~$300/kWh, well below the cost 
(TSLA)                                      of the current Tesla Roadsters pack (~$550/kWh), and substantially below large 
Overweight                                  format prismatic lithium battery costs ($750-1000 kWh now, expected to be $375-
                                            500 kWh by mid-decade). Key reasons for the pack cost saves from Roadster to

                                            competitors, uses 18650 form-factor small lithium cylindrical cells (the Roadster

nominal energy stored in a battery-
pack.                                       complexity) but they are fairly costly, at least today. Roughly speaking, lower per 
                                            kWh battery cost allows Tesla to create a   pack with more batteries, hence greater 
 
                                            range. We believe the 300 mile range Model S has a ~90 kWh battery pack (most 
                                            other carmakers are working with significa ntly smaller packs; the pure-EV Nissan 
Class leading battery storage capacity      Leaf, for example, has only a 100 mile range due to its 24 kWh pack). Carmakers

                                            EV market potential 
                                            Many third party consultancies have estimated that PHEVs (plug-in hybrid vehicles) 
                                            and EVs combined could account for 5-10% of global auto production by 2020 
                                            (translating into a 5-10MM unit segment at that time, and we would suspect that the 
                                            EV/PHEV split between this would be 30/7 0). We believe key long-term drivers are

                                            400 mile ranges), but we believe infrastructure anxiety remains a major hurdle for the 
                                            foreseeable future, suggesting pure EVs w ill likely be a consumers second car, not 
                                            the sole/primary mode of transport. PHEV s, which run pure electric for a limited 
                                            range (e.g., 40 miles) after which a gas-powered generator recharges the battery, 
                                            likely would find wider acceptance amongst single car owning consumers.  

                                            Manufacturing ramp risks high, while technology risks seem lower

                                      Toyotas NUMMI plant does de-risk the ramp). We calculate that a one-year delay in 
                                      volume ramp vs. our projected timeframe would hit free cash flow by $350MM (a

 Model-S will be employing a          concerned about the Model S. The Model S, while novel on many fronts, is not all 
 refined version of the Roadster      that risky in terms of its technology, in our view, as it will essentially be employing a 
 battery, reducing technological 
                                      refinement (read: more powerful, lower cost ) version of Roadsters (Gen II) battery 
 risk. 
                                      pack (since 2008, Tesla has sold 1,063      Roadsters and there are no reports of 
                                      widespread battery pack failures or safety issues).  

                                      Daimler/Toyota's involvement validates technology 
                                      Daimler plans to use Tesla's pack in the  smart and A-Class vehicles, and owns ~8% 
                                      of TSLA. While we suspect that Daimler' s Tesla stake (like its ~$65MM investment 
                                      in Chinese electric carmaker BYD, and 49.9% stake in battery manufacturer Evonik) 
                                      is a part of a portfolio approach, it is encouraging to note that Daimler plans to use 
                                      Tesla's battery pack in its  smart and A-Class. Further, Toyota has recently made an 
                                      equity investment of $50MM in Tesla (~3%), and has agreed to use Tesla packs for 
                                      all-electric versions of the RAV4 (unconfi   rmed press reports state Tesla is also 
                                      involved in EV versions of the Lexus RX and a Toyota high-end sports car). We 
                                      think Daimlers and Toyotas involvement provides technology validation. 

Tesla seems to so far be              Small and so different

OEM peers on product 
                                      industry, have many advantages, in our view.  (1) Product development: fast and low 
development.  
                                      cost  Tesla spends a fraction of what global auto peers spend to develop a new 
                                      vehicle, and does it relatively fast, aided  by physical co-location of design and 
                                      engineering staffs. Development costs for  the Roadster were $100MM and expected 
                                      to be $400MM for the Model S versus ~$1B reported for most global OEMs for their 
Owning, not franchising, the 
dealer network could constrain        PHEVs/Evs. Partly because of this, Tesla claims its break -even point on Model S is 
growth pace but this could have       only 10k units. (2) Distribution  Tesla plans to 100% own (not franchise) its dealer 
many long-term benefits.              network. While this can potentially slow the pace of distribution point expansion, 
                                      this approach should benefit TSLA long term, both in terms of profitability and being 
                                      able to tightly control brand equity and customer experience.   (3) EV Pure Play  -- 
                                      Tesla claims it has never entertained developing anything but an EV. Most other 
                                      carmakers are focused on a portfolio approach covering all future powertrain options 
                                      (refining gas/diesel engines, HEVs, PHEVs,   EVs, and fuel cells). While Tesla is 
                                      clearly effectively putting all its eggs in one basket, its sole focus on pure EVs 
                                      should help it better conquer technical challenges and also keep costs low.  

                                      Investment Risks 

                                      Downside Risks: (1) Established luxury carmakers introduce competing vehicles 
                                      that eventually prove performance and cost competitive to Teslas technology. Audi, 
                                      for example, is targeting a 2012 launch of its E-tron EV ultra luxury sports car, and 
                                      Mercedes and Porsche have pure EV sports car plans in the works as well. (2) The 
                                      manufacturing ramp of Model S is delayed notably. (3) Model S sales start 
                                      cannibalizing Roadster sales. (4) Elon Musk (CEO) is a key executive whose loss to 
                                      the company could potentially be fairly detrimental (he has a history of moving on 
                                      once companies become successful). We see him as a visionary who drives Tesla to 
                                      high technical and commercial targets.

                                     Tesla, an electric carmaker, is based in Palo Alto, California, and is currently the 
                                     only company to manufacture federally compliant pure electric vehicles (EVs) 
                                     commercially with its Tesla Roadster vehicle, an EV that was launched in early 
                                     2008. Tesla had sold 1,063 Roadster vehicles through March 31, 2010, and is now 
                                     planning to launch a mid-size luxury sedan called Model-S (~$50K base price) in 
                                     late 2012. Apart from manufacturing electric vehicles, Tesla also sells battery packs 
                                     to Daimlers smart and A-Class electric vehicles. Very recently, Toyota made an 
                                     equity investment in Tesla and also agreed to develop an EV version of the RAV4 
                                     compact SUV for Toyota that may go on sale in 2012.

                                       Outlook for Electrified Vehicles 

                                       While Teslas medium-term volume projections do not seem aggressive (2.0% 
                                       projected market share in 20 13 of the global mid-size luxury sedan segment, e.g. 
                                       BMW 5-series segment), we believe the longer-term success of the company (and 
                                       our long-dated projections) will ultimately hinge on the magnitude of consumer 
                                       adaptation of electrified vehicles (PHEVs or EVs). 

                                       There are many 2020 EV/PHEV market pe  netration rate forecasts but these are 
                                       essentially guesstimates at this stage as  OEMs do not typically release product plans 
                                       (let alone a products volume targets) more than 2-3 years in advance of a vehicle 
                                       launch. As such, while these estimates can provide a useful flag post, it is perhaps 
                                       more useful at this juncture to debate the underlying factors that will influence the 
                                       curve shape of electrified vehicles penetration rates.

                                                case, we believe consumer range an xiety will likely remain a, if not  the, 
                                                primary constraining force on adaptation rates of EVs (but PHEVs can 
                                                overcome this issue by having a range-extending gasoline/diesel generator 
                                                onboard).  

OEMs are highly unlikely to                •   Battery Technologies  Battery technology should broadly be viewed in 
pigeon hole themselves into any                 two dimensions:   cell chemistry   (there are many flavors of lithium 
single battery chemistry or form 
                                                chemistries and, eventually, there is likely to be non-lithium based 
factor long term but in reality, 
switching battery chemistries                   chemistries as well) and   cell form factor   (large flat/prismatic or small 
probably entails less                           cylindrical). We believe OEMs are highly unlikely to pigeon hole 
engineering/R&D investment                      themselves into any single battery chemistry or form factor long term, but in 
than switching battery form                     reality, switching battery chemistries probably entails less engineering/R&D 
factors. 
                                                investment than switching battery form factors. Tesla is one of the only 
                                                EV/PHEV carmakers to use small lithium cylindrical cells. In battery 
                                                parlance, Tesla uses a 18650 form factor lithium battery with the 18 and 
                                                65 digits referring to the width and height in mm of the cylindrical battery. 
                                                Small cylindrical cells are generally  much cheaper than (the newer) large 
                                                format prismatic lithium batteries as the former is an established product 
                                                already manufactured in extremely high  volume by Asian electronics firms 
                                                (Panasonic/Sanyo, Samsung, etc) for  use in consumer electronics. On the 
                                                flip side, the large and flat shape of prismatic cells lend themselves to a) 
                                                greater packaging efficiency in a vehi   cle, b) fewer cells per pack (ie, 
                                                reduced pack complexity), and (supposedly, though Tesla likely would not 
                                                agree) c) more robust cell cooling; tight management of battery cell 
                                                temperature is critical to maintaining a cells longevity. We later discuss 
                                                Teslas battery form factor choice in greater detail but the most critical point 
                                                to understand is that its use of small lithium cylindrical cells is a major, and 
                                                perhaps the primary, contributor to what we believe is its leading battery

                                                   whether or not this cost advantage ca       n be maintained as costs of large

                                                   critical but we believe often under-explained competitive advantages is that 
                                                   its battery costs are likely substantially lower than this level (perhaps in the 
                                                   $250-300 range for the M odel S), partly because its battery packs rely on 
                                                   commoditized small format cylindrical   cells (widely used in consumer 
                                                   electronics) instead of the newer prismatic batteries (discussed more below). 
                                                   We believe Tesla could do one of two things with this cost advantage: either 
                                                   sell its vehicle for a lower cost relative to competing vehicles with a 
                                                   comparable energy density (storage capacity) battery pack or simply sell the 
                                                   car with a much larger battery pack       to achieve greater aggregate storage 
                                                   capacity, which in turn should translate into that much greater vehicle range. 
                                                   Tesla has essentially chosen the latter option.  

In the US, annual fuel costs are              •   Consumers ownership cost considerations   While EVs (and PHEVs) 
estimated at $0.04/mile for gas                    have a notable upfront cost premium to ICE (internal combustion engine) 
engines and $0.12 for EVs; 
                                                   vehicles today, the long-term economics of owning EVs look quite 
translating into $1,260/yr of 
annual average savings on fuel                     favorable. Several factors to consider:  1) Upfront Vehicle Acquisition Cost 
costs.                                              it is widely expected that battery costs can fall another 50% from current 
                                                   levels, at least for large format prismatic batteries, and sizable declines 
                                                   likely for small formal cylindrical ce     ll batteries as well. Therefore, the 
                                                   upfront vehicle acquisition cost premium can likely eventually be 
                                                   eliminated/narrowed; 2) Fuel Consumption Costs  We assume annual cost 
                                                   of fuel for EVs to be $0.04/mile versus $0.12/mile for ICE vehicles (this 
                                                   assumes gas prices of $3/gallon, and av erage US vehicle fuel efficiency of 
                                                   25 mpg for gasoline powered vehicl         es and 3.3 miles/kWh for electric 
                                                   vehicles). Assuming an average of 15,000 miles per year per vehicle, annual 
                                                   fuel consumption costs would be an estimated $540 for EVs versus $1,800 
                                                   for gasoline vehicles;  3) Vehicle Maintenance Costs   we do not have any 
                                                   reasonable way of measuring maintenance costs for EVs, but assuming 
                                                   batteries perform as expected with an  8 year or so life, operating costs for 
                                                   EVs may prove competitive given fewer moving parts.  4) Vehicle Residual 
                                                   Values  the performance of all batteries degrade with time in that  they lose 
                                                   storage capacity, meaning vehicle range  fades with time. Most carmakers at 
                                                   this stage feel comfortable guaranteeing EV battery packs for only 8-10 
                                                   years at most. ICE engines do not have such an obvious degradation path. If 
                                                   battery replacement costs do not fall no tably in the coming decade, residual 
                                                   values for EVs may prove uncompetitive to ICE engines.  

                                                                                                                                    7

Competition can initially be good                   •    Competition aimed at Tesla should be  severe, even if not in plain sight

                                      The Uniqueness of Teslas Battery Pack 

                                      Key engineering differences between Te  slas power-train and that of other 
                                      EVs/PHEVs is in battery  cell form factor (shape) and the thermal management 
                                      of the individual cells.  Tesla uses traditional small cylindrical lithium ion battery 
                                      cells, the type widely used in todays laptops, instead of the newer generation, large 
                                      format prismatic (i.e., flat) lithium ion batteries. In addition, Tesla uses active liquid 
                                      thermal control of the pack to individually control the temperature of each cell (the 
                                      Nissan Leaf, for example, does not use liquid thermal control).  

                                      Teslas IP seems to primarily lie in     the effective management of the battery 
                                      pack, and the company is agno stic to battery chemistry  (Roadster uses lithium 
                                      Cobalt Oxide, and Model-S will use lithium Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum). Further, 
                                      although 18650 form-factor cylindrical ba tteries offer significant cost advantages, 
                                      Tesla could adopt, albeit with some costs, prismatic battery cells if such cells 
                                      eventually prove cost competitive, although we sense the company does not see this 
                                      as likely for at least five years. 

                                      The pack that will be used in the Model S is expected to have a roughly 90 kWh 
                                      energy density (for the 300 mile range va riant). It will likely interlink over 10,000 
                                      individual lithium NCA cells (initially manufacturing by Panasonic), and will use 
                                      liquid thermal controls. The pack is expected to retain 60% of its capacity up to 10 
                                      years.  The packs capacity deterioration curve is quite flat / shallow in year 1-5, and 
                                      then sees a steeper fall between years 6 and 8.  

                                      Small Cylindrical vs. Large Format Prismatic Batteries 
                                      Each Tesla (Roaster) battery pack links to gether 6,831 individual cylindrical cells. 
                                      Daimler, via its usage of Tesla-sourced   smart EV battery packs, Toyota with its 
                                      agreement to develop an electric RAV4 w  ith Tesla, BMW, via its Mini E model, 
                                      which will have 5,088 individual cylindrical cells, are the only other carmakers we 
                                      know of that appear to have seen the virtues of small cylindrical cell based battery 
                                      packs. Electric power-trains being developed by most other carmakers generally plan 
                                      to employ a far fewer amount of the (much larger) prismatic form factor cells.  

                                      In general, small cylindrical battery ce   lls are considered a more established 
                                      technology, but many auto industry players we have spoken to appear to be 
                                      convinced that the future of electric vehi  cle power-trains lies with prismatic cells. 
                                      Tesla seems open to battery form factor changes in the future, but simply believes 
                                      that cylindrical cells offer the best value proposition for several years to come. 

                                      While prismatic cells result in better space utilization due to their flat structure, 
                                      we think small cylindrical ce     lls may have future converts.     In addition to 
                                      cylindricals sizable cost advantage today (a nd we believe likely for at least another 
                                      3-5 years), as a packs energy density ra ting rises (presumably all OEMs will seek 
                                      greater range over time), cell management  challenges grow in a non-linear manner  
                                      smaller cells are easier to control individually  than larger cells (i e, fire propagation 
                                      risk is reduced).  

                                      The major supposed disadvantage of Tesl  as battery pack is that it employs 
                                      many more individual parts  than that which would result from the usage of large 

                                                                                                                         11

                                      format prismatic batteries, and therefore Tesl as pack is presumably more suspect to 
                                      quality/performance issues. We do not agree with this assessment, and believe 
                                      Teslas engineering, with its non-automotive mindset, has perhaps been more open to 
                                      investing in refining its more complex design, which we believe provides superior 
                                      value overall.  

                                      We believe there are several advantages        to Teslas battery pack design of 
                                      multiple small cylindrical cells (over prismatic cells), which we outline below. 

                                           •   Cost   Unlike prismatic batteries, 18650 form factor (cylindrical) lithium 
                                               cells are a largely comm   oditized product with a  very large installed 
                                               manufacturing base, primarily in Asia. This allows Teslas batteries to be 
                                               highly cost competitive relative to the performance they provide. Tesla has 
                                               not revealed the precise cost of its battery pack. Tesla expects Model S pack 
                                               cost to be about 35-40% below the pack cost for Roadster 2.0. Roadster 
                                               2.0's pack cost has not been revealed but Tesla has in the past said (prior to 
                                               Roadster 2.0 being launched) that Roadster pack total costs were ~$36k, 
                                               implying $679/kWh. However, we think Roadster 2.0 pack costs have been 
                                               improved since that statement was made , and its cost currently is perhaps 
                                               around ~$550/kWh. We think TSLA will likely achieve another 45% cost 
                                               reduction (ie, to ~$300/kWh) for Model S pack (we note CEO Musk has 
                                               publicly stated that Model S pack costs will be well below Nissan Leaf's 
                                               supposed $350/kWh). While these anticipated cost reductions by TSLA 
                                               would exceed the pace of cost reductio ns expected from lithium prismatic 
                                               battery makers (from $750-1000/kWh today to $375-500/kWh by mid-
                                               decade), it would be reasonable to assume   that the rate of cost reduction 
                                               beyond 2012 for Tesla (assuming it continues to use cylindrical packs) will 
                                               probably not be as much as that of the less mature prismatic cells.   

                                           •   Energy Density / Power Density   Cylindrical form factor batteries tend to 
                                               have better gravimetric energy density or specific energy (Wh/kg), but 
                                               prismatic form factors tend to have better power density (W/kg). We believe 
                                               one explanation for why many other carmakers have tended to favor 
                                               prismatic form factors is that they are not primarily focused on pure EVs. 
                                               Energy density is directly linked to vehicle range, while power density 
                                               primarily influences acceleration. As  such, carmakers focused primarily on 
                                               HEV/PHEV applications seem to have an understandable bias toward 
                                               prismatic batteries, while the more range-sensitive pure EV manufacturers 
                                               such as Tesla perhaps have found cylindrical designs more valuable.  

                                           •   Safety / Abuse Tolerance   Tesla believes cylindrical form batteries are 
                                               inherently safer than larger prismatic batteries because each failure (thermal 
                                               runaway or fire) can be confined to a relatively small (cylindrical) cell. This, 
                                               of course, assumes fires are prevented from propagating from one cell to 
                                               adjacent cells, a technology focus area in which Tesla has apparently made 
                                               substantial progress, according to battery vendors such as Sanyo. It is worth 
                                               noting that of the multiple Tesla Roadster crashes that have occurred so far, 
                                               none has resulted in fires (even though some of the crashes were extremely 
                                               severe). A Designnews.com (July 30, 2009) article quoted CTO J.B. 
                                               Straubel saying that Tesla's cooling system uses a manifold and cooling 
                                               tubes to run an even mix of water and glycol through the pack, drawing heat

                                                                                                                               424

                                                 away from the batteries. As a result, the possibility of a cell sparking and 
                                                 setting fire propagation is reduced.  

                                            •   Redundancy  Using multiple small cells allows a configuration in which 
                                                 many parallel cell arrays can be employed, meaning the loss of any single 
                                                 cell in an array minimizes the amount of total reduction in battery pack 
                                                 power. Teslas battery pack is configured as 69 parallel cell arrays with each 
                                                 array holding a series/group of 99 individual cells (69 x 99 = 6,831 total 
                                                 cells). Some competitors, for example, that use large prismatic batteries 
                                                 configure the pack as  2 arrays with each array holding a series/group of 100 
                                                 individual cells. Said differently, the loss of a single cell, which would 
                                                 result in the loss of that entire array given its serial, Christmas tree light-
                                                 like, formation, means that Tesla loses only 1/69th (1.5%) of its battery 
                                                 power. 

                                            •   Manufacturing Yield    Tesla believes the manufacturing process of 
                                                 cylindrical cells is inherently more efficient and less prone to errors, which 
                                                 in turn partly explains why cylindrical cells are lower cost. Tesla believes 
                                                 battery manufacturing yield is related to total surface area of the electrode  
                                                 the smaller the electrode (as in cylindrical cells), the better the yields. 

                                                                                                                              13

                                                                  grow to $2.2B in 2014 and $3.7B in 2015. Our revenue estimates are based on 20K

                                     EPS of -$1.38 in 2010, -$1.88 in 2011 and -$1.46 in 2012. As Model-S volumes start 
                                     appearing fully in 2013 after the models   potential launch in late 2012, we expect 
                                     Tesla to report its first profitable year in 2013 with an EPS of $1.51 ($1.15 assuming 
                                     normalized 24% tax rate), which falls to $1.07 in 2014 ($0.81 assuming normalized 
                                     24% tax rate) due to higher SG&A and R&D costs prior to launch of the Gen-III 
                                     car in 2015. We expect EPS in 2015, however, to jump sharply to $3.12, as SG&A 
                                     and R&D costs moderate and revenues from   "Gen-III" vehicles kick in. We also 
                                     assume 2015 to be the first year Tesla will be paying normalized taxes         ─ an 
                                     estimated 24% on a blended basis. 

                                     Our 2013 EPS would be $0.18 higher should the 2013 operating margin be 100 bps 
                                     higher. Also, we estimate that each 5K a dditional model-S vehicles would provide a 
                                     $1.00 uplift to our 2013 EPS estimate. Therefore, we estimate that 25K model-S 
                                     vehicles (vs. 18.5K in our model) and 15% operating margin (vs. 8.3% in our model) 
                                     would yield an EPS of $3.51 in 2013 (vs. $1.51 in our model). 

                                     Free Cash Flow 
                                     The estimated negative spread between D&  A (depreciation and amortization) and 
                                     capital expenditure, coupled with roughly neutral working capital, should result in 
                                     significant free cash outflow for the next   few years for the company. We expect 
                                     capital expenditure to be substantially higher for the next few years as Tesla invests 
                                     in development of Model-S (and derivatives) and Gen-III cars. We estimate 
                                     $195MM of free cash outflow (vs. -$141 net loss) in 2010, $297MM of free cash 
                                     outflow (vs. -$194 net loss) in 2011, $175MM of free cash outflow (vs. -$152MM 
                                     net loss) in 2012 and $153MM of free cash flow generation (vs. $159MM net 
                                     income) in 2013. 

                                     The timely launch of Model-S becomes more necessary, in our view, as the cash on 
                                     the balance sheet should fall significantly to $44MM in 2012 (even after fully 
                                     utilizing DOE loans and IPO proceeds) due to the above discussed free cash 
                                     outflows. Our model, as such, suggests    that Tesla could do a small-size capital 
                                     market transaction sometime in future to fund its future investments.  

                                     Teslas Operating Margins vs. Peers 
                                     We expect Tesla to report positive op erating income for the first time in 2013  
                                     after the launch of Model-S in late 2012, and expect the company to generate 
                                     $153MM of operating profit in the year. While the company guides to 14-16% 
                                     operating margins long term, we model more conservatively and assume an 8.3% 
                                     operating margin in 2013, which, we believe, is more analogous to the 5-10% 
                                     normalized margins posted by traditional luxury automakers such as BMW, 
                                     Mercedes, Audi, etc.  

                                                                                                                       15 

                                                                                                                             427

                                        Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates. Operating margin estimates for future years are the published estimates of J.P. 
                                        Morgan's European Auto Analyst. 

                                        Tesla could make a higher operating margin than traditional luxury carmakers, 
                                        at least for the initial few years.   As more and more electric vehicles come to the 
                                        market, and automakers start competing neck and neck in EVs (eg, Audi E-tron is 
                                        expected in 2012/2013), operating margins could decline but we believe would likely 
                                        remain higher than the luxury automakers, given the cost advantage and several other 
                                        strategic initiatives taken by the company, as mentioned below. 

                                        •   Tesla claims to be able to develop vehicles at a significantly lower cost than 
                                             the peers:  Tesla developed Roadster with just $100MM, though it does not 
                                             include development of assembly lines,  etc., as Tesla gets Current Generation 
                                             Roadster assembled by a third party vendor in UK       ─ Lotus Cars Limited. 
                                             Moreover, operating income from Roadster vehicles turned positive in 1Q:10, 
                                             even at todays lower volumes, which   we believe likely denotes a significant 
                                             cost advantage that Tesla has over its peers. Tesla expects Model-S development 
                                             costs, including development of assembly lines, to equate to ~$400MM        ─ 
                                             substantially lower than what other automakers usually need to develop a new 
                                             model like this. This makes us believe that the company would likely be able to 
                                             develop and build future vehicles (Model-S and its derivatives, Gen-III cars etc.) 
                                             at a lower overall costs than other automakers. 

                                        •   Tesla owns its dealerships:   Tesla, unlike other automakers, would run the 
                                             dealerships on its own, which should help the company to manage its inventories 
                                             in a better fashion. We believe this would likely help Tesla to post higher 
                                             operating margins than  would the traditional automakers as Tesla would likely 
                                             capture the operating margins dealers usually make from selling new vehicles 
                                             (publicly listed dealers typically make 3-4% operating margin, on a normalized 
                                             basis). 

                                        •   Powertrain development is singularly focused: Tesla invests only in electric 
                                             vehicles. Most other global carmakers are simultaneously investing in gas, 
                                             diesel, HEVs, PHEVs, and EVs (some are also investing in fuel cells and CNG). 
                                             The narrower focus of Tesla's powertrain plans by itself could suggest lower 
                                             research and development costs.  

                                        Though R&D costs and SG&A expenses                 are expected to be abnormally 
                                        higher for the next few years:   On Research and Development (R&D), we expect 
                                        Tesla to spend of $80MM in 2010, $139MM in 2011, $150MM in 2012 and 

16                                       

                                                                                                                                      428

                                                   $161MM in 2013. For the next three years, we expect Tesla to invest more in R&D 
                                                   to develop "Gen-III" cars, which we assu                    me will be launched in late 2015. In 
                                                   subsequent years, we expect R&D costs to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% of 
                                                   revenues. We expect SG&A expenses to be $90MM in 2010, $91MM in 2011, 
                                                   $112MM in 2012 and $135MM in 2013. It is worth noting that non-cash stock based 
                                                   compensation is included in the SG&A number mentioned above. In future years, we 
                                                   expect SG&A costs (excluding stock-based compensation) to be ~6% of total 
                                                   revenues, in line with Tesla's long-term SG&A guidance. 

                                                   Non-GAAP EPS 
                                                   Walking from GAAP net-income to non-GAAP net-income:  In its future earnings 
                                                   releases, Tesla will add back the following two items to its reported GAAP net-
                                                   income number to calculate non-GAAP net income:  (1) Stock-based compensation, 
                                                   which would be included mainly in the reported SG&A and a smaller amount in 
                                                   R&D;  (2) Gains or losses associated with                     marking-to-market DOE warrant. We 
                                                   adopt the same methodology, and add back non-cash stock based compensation to 
                                                   our net income estimates before calculating EPS for the company. Also, for 
                                                   simplicity purposes, we assume no gains (losses) from marking-to-market (MTM) 
                                                   the DOE warrants. 

                                                   Free Cash Flow Consideration 
                                                   We estimate that Tesla will not generate meaningful free cash flow until 2016, as 
                                                   Tesla would need to have significant capital expenditures for the next several years 
                                                   related to various items like development and expansion of production capacity, 
                                                   opening new stores, etc. 

                                                   Expansion of vehicle assembly capacity for Gen-III would require Tesla to make 
                                                   higher capital investments for the next few years:     We estimate that Tesla will 
                                                   need to make $465MM of capital investment in the period 2013-2015 to expand the 
                                                   vehicle assembly capacity for the production of lower-priced (and likely higher 
                                                   volume) Gen-III cars. However, we believe that investment in the NUMMI plant 
                                                   would significantly lower the cost to expand vehicle assembly capacity given the 
                                                   NUMMI plant produced roughly 450K vehicles at its peak. Further, we estimate 
                                                   Tesla will make $50MM investment every year (beginning 2014) toward top-hat 
                                                   development. 

                                                   We expect the companys estimated negative spread between D&A (depreciation and 
                                                   amortization) and capital expenditure, coupled with roughly neutral working capital, 
                                                   to result in significant free cash outflow   for the next few years. We expect capital 
                                                   expenditure to be substantially higher for the next few years as Tesla invests in 
                                                   development of the Model-S and its derivatives and Gen-III cars.

                                              DOE Loan and Capital Structure Outlook 
                                              Background of DOE loans: The Department of Energy (DOE) will extend a total of 
                                              $465MM loans at a 3% interest rate to Tesla to develop and build electric cars. Tesla 
                                              is under contractual obligation to pay down the loans fully by Dec-2018, failing 
                                              which DOE warrants (issued by the company to the DOE in exchange for the loans) 
                                              would convert into equity. Tesla also needs to pay down $13MM of the DOE loans 
                                              every quarter beginning 4Q:2012.  

                                              Tesla intends to fund all of its future investments to develop, build and expand 
                                              vehicle production capacities through a co  mbination of DOE lo ans (total amount 
                                              available is $465MM) and IPO proceeds (net proceeds from the IPO were $184MM).  

                                              As our model assumes the company to start generating its first significant free cash 
                                              flow in 2016, and given that Tesla needs to pay down $13MM of DOE loan every 
                                              quarter beginning 4Q:2012, we see a possibility of small-size capital market 
                                              transactions by the company in the medium term. However, we note that our FCF 
                                              forecasts are based on conservative Model- S operating margin estimates; our 8.6% 
                                              operating margin estimate in 2013 compares with the 14-16% long-term margin 
                                              guidance provided by the company. We believe that if Model-S volumes ramp up at 
                                              a pace faster than we forecast and margins come in better, Tesla should potentially be 
                                              able to fund all of its capital requirements entirely through incremental FCF 
                                              generation vs. our model. Long term, we expect Tesla to be able to fully pay down 
                                              the outstanding amount of DOE loans by the required timeframe, and therefore 
                                              expect DOE warrants to expire and to not convert into equity.

                                                  Valuation 

                                                  Our Dec-2011 price target is $25: We forecast revenue of $109MM in 2010, $1.8B 
                                                  in 2013 (assumes 18.5k Model S volumes), and ~$5B by 2016 (includes planned 3-
                                                  series competitor). In 2013, we see EBIT margin of 8.3%, in line with German 
                                                  luxury OEM historical ranges, and EPS of $1.51 ($1.15 using normalized tax rate). 
                                                  We get to $25 using both a DCF (11.7% discount rate, 4% terminal growth, inclusive 
                                                  of 2011 burn) and price/sales (1.4x which is the 1.5x average 2012 p/sales of A123, 
                                                  Ener1, BYD discounted one year as we apply it to Teslas 2013 sales). Our $25 price 
                                                  target implies a somewhat lofty 27x P/E on tax rate adjusted 2013 EPS, although 
                                                  implied P/E is 22x if 10% EBIT margin is used (our margin forecast may be 
                                                  conservative at least in the initial years (guidance is 14-16%).  

                                                  We triangulate at this target using multiple  approaches, and take the average of the 
                                                  DCF based and price/sales based valuations to arrive at our price target of $24. 

                                                  We believe there are no great comps fo r Tesla, but BYD, A123 and Ener-1 are 
                                                  somewhat appropriate (latter two ar  e Li-ion battery manufacturers) . BYD is 
                                                  trading at 1.4x Bloomberg consensus 2012 sales estimate; while A123 and Ener-1 are 
                                                  trading at 1.7x and 1.4x, respectively, based on consensus 2012 estimates. We apply 
                                                  the average 2012 price/sales of these peers, discounted by one year, to Teslas 2013 
                                                  revenues (its first full year of Model S revenues).

                                                Further, Tesla has indicated that it would make Model-S available in three ranges 
                                                (160 miles, 230 miles and 300 miles), but has disclosed the base price of the 160 
                                                mile version only  ─ $49.5K excluding ZEV (zero emission vehicle) credits. We 
                                                assume the price of the 230 mile range ($61.6K) Model-S to be ~20% higher than the 
                                                160 miles version, and assume the price of the 300 mile range ($69.5K) Model-S to 
                                                be ~10% higher than the 230 miles variant. As guided by the company, we assume 
                                                20% of Model-S vehicles to be 160 miles variant, 60% to be 230 miles variant and 
                                                the remaining 20% to be 300 miles variant. 

                                                Tesla, being a pure Zero Emission Ve                  hicle (ZEV) manufacturer, sells ZEV 
                                                credits to the automakers not able to fully comply with the low-emission regulation 
                                                requirements in several states. These states   require a portion of the vehicles sold by 
                                                the automakers in the stat         e during each model year to be ZEVs. While Tesla 
                                                currently generates significant revenues (~6% of the average selling price in the US 
                                                is related to ZEV credit) from selling thes  e credits to other automakers, we expect 
                                                revenues related to ZEV credits to decline sequentially as electric vehicle penetration 
                                                increases and more and more electric vehicles come to the market. 

                                                Model-S Revenue Outlook:   Our model assumes Tesla will generate $1.8B of 
                                                revenues from Model-S vehicles in 2013, $2.2B in 2014 and, post launch of Model-S 
                                                derivatives in mid-2014 a significantly higher $3.7B in 2015. We expect revenues, 
                                                thereafter, to grow steadily. 

                                                Model-S Gross Profit Outlook:  We assume Model-S in the US will generate ~19% 
                                                (excluding ZEV credits) gross margin per vehicle sold in the US in all the years 
                                                beginning 2013 ─ lower than the ~27% gross margin (excl. ZEV credits) forecast for 
                                                higher ASP Roadster vehicles. For Model-  S vehicles sold outside the US (Europe 
                                                and Rest of the World), we expect gro                ss margin to be 25% in all the years       ─

                                      Cutting Cost of Model S Battery Pack  
                                      A key enabler to maintaining healthy gross margins on the Model S despite a lower 
                                      selling price and larger pack because of a 35 -40% expected drop in battery pack cost 
                                      per unit of energy stored ($/kWh), say from roughly $550/kWh on the current 
                                      Roadster to ~$300/kWh on the Model S. Key drivers behind Roadster to Model S 
                                      battery cost saves (in rough order of magnitude):  

                                           1.  Pack level improvements   For example, we expect packaging density of 
                                               the Model S battery pack cells will be ~44% improved versus the 
                                               Roadster's.  

                                           2.  Economies of scale   Tesla expects Model S to have more than 30x the 
                                               annual volumes of Roadster. 

                                           3.  Cell level improvements  --  Given changes to cell chemistry, many of 
                                               them specifically suited to automotive applications, the cells for the Model 
                                               S should have 15% higher energy density than those currently used in the 
                                               Roadster (Panasonic is the initial pr ovider of Model S cells; Sanyo is 
                                               currently the Roadsters cell provider).  

                                           4.  Cell chemistry changes   The cell cathode in the Roadster cells employ 
                                               lithium cobalt (LCO) chemistry, while Model S cell cathodes will use 
                                               nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA), resultin g in a 2/3 reduction in the amount 
                                               of Cobalt used per cell. Cobalt is relatively more expensive than aluminum 
                                               and nickel.

                                     Roadster Revenue and Gross Profit Outlook 
                                     Small volume expected from Current-Generation Roadsters:     For Current-
                                     Generation Roadster vehicles, Tesla relies on Lotus Cars Limited in Hethel, England, 
                                     for the assembly of body and chassis sy      stems (gliders) and is in contractual 
                                     agreement to get the first 1,700 assembled Roadster gliders from Lotus by March 
                                     2011; our model assumes Tesla easily meets the contractual obligation.  

                                     We expect Tesla to sell roughly half of the Current-Generation Roadster sales outside 
                                     the US. The base price of the (Current-Generation) Roadster is $109K (excluding 
                                     ZEV credits of $8.5K and options of $26K) and is expected to remain the same until 
                                     2012.  

                                     Next-Generation Roadster to be launched in 2013 likely with a lower ASP would 
                                     have larger volumes:  Beginning 2013, we expect        Tesla to start building and 
                                     assembling the lower price Next-Generation Roadster at its facility in California. We 
                                     forecast Tesla to sell 1.5K Next-Generation  Roadster globally in  2013 (in line with 
                                     guidance). In subsequent years, however, we expect Roadster unit sales to grow to 
                                     1.75K in 2014, 1.95K in 2015, and increase  1K units each year  thereafter. While the 
                                     base price of Roadster vehicles currently on road is ~$109K (excluding ZEV credits 
                                     and options), we anticipate the base pri  ce of Next-Generation Roadster at ~$75K, 
                                     lower than company guidance of $100K. Lower base price estimate vs. company 
                                     guidance is reflective of our assumption that Current-Generation Roadsters hefty 
                                     price reflects a novelty factor (of being the only high range EV) that eventually fade, 
                                     particularly after the Model-S launch in   2012. Further, we expect ZEV credits to 
                                     decrease in the long term, as several auto makers start building electric cars, which 
                                     should be more popular by then. Our model assumes ZEV credit to decline from 
                                     4.0K in 2013, to 3.0K in 2014, 2.0K in 2015, 1.0K in 2016, and stable thereafter. 

                                     Tesla Roadster Revenue Outlook:  Correspondingly, our model assumes revenues 
                                     from Current-Generation Roadster vehicles to be $81MM in 2010, $80MM in 2011 
                                     and $53MM in 2012. After that, Tesla would launch Next-Generation Roadster 
                                     vehicles in 2013 which is expected to generate $148MM of revenues in 2013, 
                                     $171MM in 2014 and $184MM in 2015. 

                                     Tesla Roadster Gross Profit Outlook:  As guided by the company, we assume that 
                                     each Roadster vehicle sold in the US has an  average cost of goods sold (COGS) of 
                                     $120K in 2010, $115K in 2011 and $112K in 2012, and arrive at 12% overall gross 
                                     margin (excl. ZEV credits) per vehicle in the US from Roadster vehicles in 2010, 
                                     16% and 18% (excl. ZEV credits) in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In subsequent 
                                     years, however, we apply a constant ~27% gross margin (excl. ZEV credits) per 
                                     Roadster vehicle sold in the US. For Road    ster vehicles sold outside the US (in 
                                     Europe and Rest of the World), we assume average cost of goods sold of $118K in 
                                     2010, $113K in 2011 and $110K in 2012 and arrive at 18/20/22% gross margins in 
                                     2010/2011/2012. In future years beyond 2012, we apply a constant 32.5% gross 
                                     margin per Roadster vehicle sold outside the US.

                                     Gen-III Car Revenue and Gross Profit Outlook 
                                     The Gen-III Car is expected to be launched in 2015 and would likely compete 
                                     with mass-market luxury vehicles such as the BMW 3-series:  We expect Tesla 
                                     to launch "Gen-III" cars in  late-2015 with a base price in the vicinity of $35K, 
                                     designed to compete with the likes of the BMW 3-Series. We project the volumes of 
                                     mass-market cars to grow from 6K units in 2016 to 30K units in 2017, 63K in 2017, 
                                     88K in 2018, 100K units in 2019 and 108K units in 2020. 

                                     Gen-III Cars would likely yield ne      arly half of revenues eventually:    We 
                                     estimate revenues from Gen-III cars will be $1.3B in 2016, $2.6B in 2017, $3.5B 
                                     in 2018, $4.0B in 2019 and $4.2B in 2020. We would expect the "Gen-III" cars to 
                                     eventually be the biggest dr iver of volumes and revenues for the company. By our 
                                     estimates, Gen-III cars would generate 50% of total revenues for Tesla in 2020. 

                                     Gen-III Car Gross-Profit Outlook:    For Gen-III cars sold in the US, we 
                                     assume 20% gross margin in 2015. In future years, we expect the margins to decline 
                                     from this level to 13% in 2020 due to smaller ZEV credits, a lower base price 
                                     partially offset by lower COGS (driven by lower battery costs). For the vehicles sold 
                                     outside the US, we assume 15.0% gross margin in 2015, declining to 13.5% in 2020 
                                     due to similar reasons discussed above.

                                                     Power-train Revenue and Gross Profit Outlook 
                                                     Tesla supplies battery pack to Daiml  er for the smart and Class-A vehicles:   In 
                                                     addition to manufacturing Roadster and Model-S vehicles, Tesla also supplies battery 
                                                     packs to Daimler. Daimler also made ~10% equity investment in Tesla. In addition, 
                                                     Toyota has recently announced $50MM of equity investment in Tesla.  

                                                     We believe that intent of Toyota's inve                     stment is to facilitate a supplier-vendor 
                                                     relationship with Tesla, and we estimate that Toyota would potentially source power-
                                                     trains from Tesla. Also, Toyota and Tesla  recently agreed to develop an EV version 
                                                     of the RAV4 compact SUV that may go on sale in 2012. Toyota aims to test an 
                                                     electric variant of the Corolla sedan (and likely Lexus RX luxury SUV) as well. 

                                                     Consumer Vehicle power-train volume assumptions in our model account for only 
                                                     the power trains supplied to Daimler and Toyota.  

                                                     We expect Tesla to supply power-tr                           ain modules to commercial vehicles 
                                                     beginning 2016. While the size of the addressable ma rket of the commercial trucks 
                                                     is said to be $25B annually, we estimate Tesla to generate just $32MM of revenues 
                                                     every year beginning 2016 from this business. 

                                                     We expect 25% gross margin from the                           power-train business in the next few 
                                                     years, and expect the gross margin to decline  thereafter as battery prices decline and 
                                                     automakers likely start building power trains in-house, which may be dependent on 
                                                     the outlook of penetration of EVs. We believe higher penetration of EVs would make 
                                                     a stronger case for automakers to think about building power-trains by themselves. 
                                                     We model 25% gross margins in each of the years 2010-2011, and then expect 
                                                     margins to decline to 23% in 2012, 20% in 2013, 19% in 2014 and 17% in 2015.

                                      Management 

                                      Tesla's management is led by Elon Musk (39). Today, Mr. Musk is chairman, 
                                      product architect, and CEO (CEO responsib ilities came in 2008) of Tesla, and he 
                                      also serves as CEO and CTO of SpaceX. He is also chairman of Solar City.  

                                      Mr. Musk holds a physics degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a business 
                                      degree from Wharton. Mr. Musk seems to be a serial entrepreneur, having been or 
                                      still is involved in a total of five major enterprises. He sold his first company Zip2, 
                                      an internet software firm, to Compaq in the late-90s for $307MM. He then co-
                                      founded PayPal, which he later sold in October 2002 for $1.5B to eBay. His PayPal 
                                      proceeds were used to fund SpaceX, which launched in 2002. He co-founded Tesla 
                                      in 2003. He is also involved in Solar City, started in 2006.   

One concern for investors over        Elon Musk seems passionate  about electrified vehicles (or, more broadly, about 
time may be that Elon Musk may        the clean energy space) in general, an       engineer at heart, and he is deeply 
eventually become stretched too 
                                      involved in Tesla today.   As many successful visionaries do, he has had some 
thin. 
                                      setbacks, but generally these are more around timeframe, not technological 
                                      feasibility. One concern we see for investors over time may be that Mr. Musk may 
                                      eventually become stretched too thin -- he seems to be handling his dual CEO 
                                      responsibilities (for Tesla and SpaceX)      relatively well so far, but as each 
                                      organization grows, this may become more challenging.   

                                      In addition to Mr. Musk, we think JB Straub el, Tesla's CTO, plays a critical role in 
                                      the company's success. Mr. Straubel has a masters degree in energy engineering from 
                                      Stanford. Mr. Straubel is   also a Tesla co-founder, and he currently oversees the 
                                      technical and engineering design of the vehicles, focusing primarily on the battery, 
                                      motor, power electronics, and software su    b-systems. Prior to Tesla, he was co-
                                      founder and CTO of Volacom, an aerospace firm.

HR head is ex-Google. 
                                      industries. For example, th e manufacturing head is ex-Toyota, the retail distribution 
                                      head is ex-Apple/Gap, and the HR head is ex-Google. We believe this wide net of 
                                      industry expertise is likely to form a strong management team that takes the best 
                                      disciplines from multiple industries. 

                                                                                                                         31

This chart shows J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of this stock; the current analyst may or may not have covered it
over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings: OW = Overweight, N = Neutral, UW = Underweight.
 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:   
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:  Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.]  Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) 
coverage universe.]  Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analysts (or the analysts teams) coverage universe.] J.P. Morgan Cazenoves UK Small/Mid-Cap dedicated research 
analysts use the same rating categories; however, each stocks expected total return is compared to the expected total return of the FTSE 
All Share Index, not to those analysts coverage universe. A list of these analysts is available on request. The analyst or ana lysts teams 
coverage universe is the sector and/or country shown on the cover of each publication.  See below for the specific stocks in the certifying 
analyst(s) coverage universe.
