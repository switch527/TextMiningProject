       We have valued Telenav using a discounted cash flow analysis using a 2% 
       perpetual growth rate in line with long-t erm industry growth and a 15% discount 
       rate (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta  of 1.4 and risk premium of 7%). Downside 
       risks include the threat of continued com  petition from free navigation providers 
       such as Google. Upside risks include the potential for increased ramp in premium 
       services and a better than advertising results from Sprint customers in 2011.

27 January 2011       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                            

                               Telenav reported 2QFY10 revenue of $48.0 million ahead of our estimate of $46.9 million and 
                               consensus of $46.2 million; pro-forma EPS of  $0.24 came in well ahead of the streets and 
                               our estimate of $0.17.  

                               Telenavs main customers, Sprint and AT&T , respectively represented 45% and 40% of the 
                               revenue. The AT&T contract was renewed with no  change to the terms, which means it is 
                               still a revenue sharing agreement. T-mobile and US cellular accounted for 9% of revenues. 

                               The company saw continued improvement in its mobile advertising platform. The click 
                               through rate was 3.6% and for those who clicke d, the drive through rate was over 24%. In 
                               addition, the company continues to leverage  its core customer area to grow revenue from 
                               premium navigation, automotive  and enterprise LBS. This segment accounted for less than 
                               5% of revenues in the prior year and now accounts for 7% of revenues. 

                               The company increased its monthly paid subscri bers to 19.6 million, up  from 17.7 million in 
                               the prior quarter and 12.7 million in the prior year.  

                               Guidance 
                               The company guided earnings of $0.16 to $0. 18 per share for FYQ3, ahead of the street and 
                               our expectations of $0.16. The company also rev  ised its full year guidance upward, saying 
                               revenue would be between $195 and $200 million          and non-GAAP earnings would be 
                               between $0.84 and $0.88 per share. This is abov  e the street and our revenue estimate of 
                               $190 million. The EPS estimate is above the st  reet estimate of $0.56 and our estimate of 
                               $0.75.  

                               Financials 
                               The company generated $28.5 in cash from opera tions and increased thei r cash position to 
                               155.7 million. During the quarter the compan y repurchased 328,000 shares, bringing shares 
                               outstanding to between 45 and 46 million.   
                                
                               Conclusion 
                               Telenav continues to generate solid quarters . The company beat our estimates across most 
                               metrics. This was the first full quarter under   the new Sprint agreement. Under this, Sprint 
                               pays Telenav a fixed fee regardless of subscr iber adds. This has been a meaningful overhang 
                               on the stock and a factor which puts a dent in their revenue growth for the year. However, 
                               even on this front there were signs of positive trends. The company generated some revenue 
                               from premium subscriptions with Sprint subscri bers, this is still relatively small but bodes 
                               well for the companys long-term growth.  

                               The chief concern we have with Telenav, and a ke y issue we hear from investors, is the high 
                               level of customer concentration. Sprint cont ributed 45% of revenue and AT&T 40%, and as 
                               we saw two quarters ago large carrier customers  are not afraid to throw their weight around. 
                               We saw two encouraging signs on this front.   The first, the company announced they have 
                               renewed their AT&T contract for two years und er existing terms. We were concerned that 
                               AT&T would follow Sprints lead and seek better terms from Telenav. That has not come to 
                               pass. Secondly, revenue concentration has come down to 85% in Q2 from 87% in Q1 and 
                               >90% a year ago. The other legs of the companys business all advanced a bit, with 
                               international revenue now up 4%. The new carri er customers, T-Mobile US and US Cellular, 
                               now contribute 9% of revenue which is a stro ng showing for relationships less than a year 
                               old.  

                               Going forward we will be watching two factors.   First, can the company return to positive 
                               operating leverage? In a SaaS model, contribu tion margins from each  incremental customer 
                               should be highly positive. For Telenav, the new  Sprint model and ongoing R&D costs, mean 
                               that operating leverage is not apparent, an  d we still do not have the company growing

27 January 2011       Wireless Equipment  TeleNav                                                                             

                                earnings in FY12. However, there are some signs that by FY 13 (which we are not yet 
                                modeling) should see a return to earnings gr owth. The Sprint contract remains a sore spot, 
                                but we are comfortable with the companys R& D investments. A second focus will be the 
                                companys ability to diversify and grow revenue.  As noted above, there are early signs that 
                                this is proceeding slowly. The big question h ere will be can the companys ad platform gain 
                                traction. We had not expected any meaningful co ntribution from this until FY12, and see no 
                                change to that. However, location-based servic   es continues to be an important area of 
                                interest in the Web community. Telenav has some   very powerful data that with time they 
                                should be able to monetize. On the call, they     noted that they have one of the largest 
                                databases of real-time traffic nodes in the form of almost 20 million active users pinging their 
                                network. Many companies are searching for viable business models here and the success of 
                                local advertising websites such as Groupon point to the strong interest in successful 
                                platforms. It remains unclear whether Telenav can find a successful model in this domain, but 
                                they would hold significant value if and when they can unlock that model. 

                                We remain cautious pending further signs of resol ving this issue and thus reiterate our Hold 
                                rating. 

                                In line with the companys latest guidance, we are raising our estimates as follows: 
                                3Q11 was $46m and $0.16, is $49m and $0.17 
                                4Q11 was $45m and $0.13, is $49m and $0.17 
                                FY11 was $190m and $0.75, is $196m and $0.88 
                                FY12 was $193m and $0.65, is $207m and $0.81 
                                CY11 was $182m and $0.51, is $196m and $0.69 
                                 
                                Risks & Valuation 
                                We are raising our price target from $5 to $8 in  line with our revised estimates. Our valuation 
                                is based on a discounted cash flow analysis   using a 2% perpetual growth rate in line with 
                                long-term industry growth and a 15%discount rate  (using a 5.5% risk free rate, a beta of 1.4 
                                and risk premium of 7%).  

                                We see two primary sources of downside risk for Telenav. The first is their dependence on a 
                                small number of carrier customers for thei     r revenue. Carriers are known to be very 
                                demanding customers. While we believe Telenav's relationship with its carrier partners is 
                                strong, the risk exists that these carriers so urce navigation elsewhere or more likely pressure 
                                Telenav to bring down its prices. A second, relat ed risk is competition from OTT navigation 
                                providers. The most significant of these are deep-pocketed players in the mobile and Internet 
                                landscape including Google, Nokia and Microsoft. These three all offer comparable navigation 
                                services bundled with their mobile operatin    g systems (OS) at no cost to carriers or 
                                consumers. We think Telenav's relationship with  the carriers shield them to some degree 
                                from this competition, but long-term expect  pricing to converge on these $0 offerings. The 
                                chief upside risk is that the renegotiation with  Sprint resolves with no change in earnings and 
                                the company returns to its prior growth trajectory. The company also has the ability to win 
                                new customers or see major customers such as AT&T switch to bundled pricing plans which 
                                would drive earnings above our estimates.      We would also see upside risk should the 
                                companys mobile ad platform take off sooner than expected.

As a result of Deutsche Banks recent acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value the 
security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may vary widely. 
Deutsche Bank has instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur for "Hold" rated stocks 
having a market cap smaller than  most other companies in its sector or region. We believe that such policy will allow us to mak e best use of our resources. Please visit our website at http://gm.db.com to determine the target 
price of any stock. 
The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be su itable for all investors and investors must make their own info rmed investment decisions. Stock transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a curr ency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange r ates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Deutsche Bank may with respect to securities covered by this report, sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis, and consider this report in deciding to trade on a proprietary basis.
