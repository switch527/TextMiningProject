                                      On April 30, 2012, CHEF announced that it is purchasing Praml International for $19.5 
                                      million. Our view:  

                                            1.   If we assume the $12 million impact to FY2012 revenues (as stated on the call) is 
                                                 based on an 8-month time frame (because the deal has already closed), this actually 
                                                 implies a ~1.1x sales multiple  too rich in our view.         If acquisitions are to play a 
                                                 meaningful role in the companys future   growth (which we assume to be the 
                                                 case), multiples need to remain in the 0.3x-0.5x range. If they dont, ROIC will 
                                                 deteriorate and so will CHEFs valuation.  

                                            2.  EBITDA multiples are meaningless in our view because expenses at small, family-run 
                                                 operations are usually out of whack. 

                                            3.  Given Pramls expertise  a dominant provid            er of French cuisine products while 
                                                 CHEF is known for its Italian cuisine products  we understand why this acquisition 
                                                 makes sense strategically, and the customer          base should serve   to expand CHEFs 
                                                 market share in an extremely robust region of the country. 

                                            4.  In addition, CHEF will move its existing operations in Las Vegas (~11,440 sq. ft) to 
                                                 the Praml facility (>30,000 sq. ft.).

                                      5.  We would have preferred to see CHEF make an acquisition in a new market  Dallas, 
                                           Boston, Chicago  to name a few. While we do trust managements ability to execute 
                                           on integration of the Praml acquisition to ensure the acquisition is accretive, we are 
                                           still perplexed as to why Las Vegas was a focus when the company already has a 
                                           presence in the Las Vegas market.  

                                  In 1Q12, CHEFs sales growth was negatively  impacted by deflation of 1.7%, largely due 
                                  to deflation in the dairy category, which represents ~26% of sales at Chefs Warehouse. 
                                  In Exhibit 3 below, we compare the inflation rate provided by CHEF each quarter with a 
                                  weighted average CPI inflation rate (using       CHEFs category sales as weights). We 
                                  acknowledge that this is not a perfect comparison, but it does appear to indicate that deflation is 
                                  unique to CHEF given its specific product mix.

                                  We are decreasing our 2Q12 EPS estimate to $0.23 from $0.26 vs. consensus of $0.26. 
                                  Our EBITDA estimate is $9.3 million.     Our estimate assumes total sales increase 19.0% to 
                                  $118.1 million, driven by 9.0% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 75 
                                  bp to 27.2%. We forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 22.5% to $22.9 million, or 
                                  a 55-bp increase as a percentage of sales to 19.3%, leading to an 8-bp improvement in operating 
                                  margins to 7.3%, or $8.7 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.3 million, a 20-bp expansion in 
                                  margin to 7.9%. We assume interest expense of $0.4 million, a 41.0% tax rate and 20.9 million 
                                  shares outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.23, a 18.4% increase from 2Q11.  

                                  In FY2012, we estimate EPS decreases to $0. 91 from $0.96. Consensus EPS is $0.95. Our 
                                  EBITDA estimate is $36.6 million.   Our estimate assumes total sales increase 15.2% to $461.0 
                                  million (vs. consensus of $459.0 million), with gross margins improving 67 bp to 27.0%. We

                                 forecast operating expenses (excluding D&A) gr ow 16.6% to $87.8 million, a 24-bp year-over-
                                 year deterioration in margin, leading to a 39-bp improvement in operating margins to 7.4%, or 
                                 $34.1 million. This gets us to EBITDA of $36.6 million, a 44-bp improvement in margin to 
                                 7.9%. We assume interest expense of $1.8 million, a 41.1% tax rate and 20.9 million shares 
                                 outstanding, which gets us to EPS of $0.91.  

                                 In 1Q12, CHEF reported EPS of $0.13, which missed our $0.14 estimate and consensus of 
                                 $0.16. Total sales increased 18.3% to $98.1 million. Gross margins improved 75 bp to 25.6%. 
                                 Operating expenses (excluding D&A) grew 22.1% to $20.4 million. Operating margins 
                                 expanded 21 bp to 5.2%, or $5.1 million, while EBITDA margins expanded 11 bp to 5.8%, or 
                                 $5.7 million. Interest expense came in at $0.6 million. Using a 41.6% tax rate and 20.9 million 
                                 shares outstanding gets us to EPS of $0.13.  

                                 Additional Takeaways  

                                    Management updated its FY2012 guidance to reflect EPS of $0.91-$0.94 and revenues of 
                                     $452-$462 million. 

                                    In 1Q12, organic sales slowed sequentially from 4Q; however, similar to last quarter we 
                                     believe this is a function of the Harry Wils  and Provvista acquisitions since CHEF was 
                                     taking share from these companies before they bought them. Additionally sales was also 
                                     negatively impacted by deflation in the dairy category, which began to occur in January and 
                                     persisted throughout the quarter, and the loss  of a drayage contract.  The drayage contract 
                                     was a one-off contract to accommodate a cust omer, and we are not surprised the company 
                                     discontinued this service since it does not fit within CHEFs current business model.  

                                    On acquisitions, the integration of the Harry Wils and Provvista Specialty Food 
                                     acquisitions remains on track.  

                                    In contrast to the casual dining segment, which saw sales deteriorate in March and further 
                                     into April, sales trends at fine dining restaurants (CHEFs core customer) held steady 
                                     throughout the entire quarter. 

                                    During 1Q, the company saw product placement and unique customer growth at levels 
                                     similar to FY2011. The company saw increased case volumes in all categories, but 
                                     particularly in dairy (which when combined with deflation caused some of the lighter than 
                                     expected sales growth). 

                                    On real estate, CHEF transitioned to a new, larger facility in Miami during 1Q, and recently 
                                     signed a lease for its new facility in the Bronx that will replace the two existing facilities. 

                                    In April, the company entered into a new credit facility that provides $180 million in 
                                     additional liquidity, comprising a $100-million cash flow revolver, $40-million term note 
                                     and $40-million accordion feature. 

                                    The loss of the drayage contract will cost the company $4 million in FY2012 revenues and 
                                     $0.02 in FY2012 EPS. Management expected to discontinue the contract in FY2013, and 
                                     was caught slightly off guard that it ended in FY2012.
