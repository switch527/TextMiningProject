INVESTMENT THESIS 
We believe CHEF is a best-in-class specialty foodservice distributor with a 
substantial growth opportunity lying ahead through a combination of internal 
growth and acquisitions, as its segment of the industry is highly fragmented and 
scale undoubtedly offers advantages. While the current momentum is obvious in 
the financial results and the geographical growth opportunity has been illustrated 
with strategic acquisitions over the last several years into new markets, we 
believe that the expansion opportunities in existing markets are not fully 
appreciated. We suspect that the catalyst for new product categories will occur in 
early 2013 when the company opens a new distribution center in New York. The 
facility will provide immediate efficiencies for CHEF’s largest market, but should 
also provide the capacity for expansion into large new categories, such as 
produce, seafood and cut meats. The category expansion opportunities could 
double the market opportunity for CHEF. 

The geographical growth opportunity is clear with CHEF operating in just seven 
markets today. However, the magnitude of the opportunity is larger than we had 
anticipated with the company targeting more major markets as viable entries 
than we’d assumed. Essentially every NFL city with the exception of Green Bay 
(although nearby Milwaukee would be served out of a Chicago entry) is a target 
that could support a Chef’s Warehouse entry. This implies more than a 
quadrupling of the current market presence (CHEF already operates in two non-
NFL cities: Los Angeles and Las Vegas). With acquisition opportunities in 
numerous new markets, yet still opportunities for tuck-ins to existing markets (as 
illustrated by the Las Vegas acquisition), the opportunity for growth through 
industry consolidation is significant. Beyond the simple math of new market 
opportunities, the benefits of scale from a true national presence have yet to even 
be realized and CHEF is already delivering strong gross and EBITDA margins. 

Given the inherent growth of specialty foods in all channels of distribution, 
CHEF’s ability to grow market share in existing markets through a superior 
offering and infrastructure, along with growth opportunities through both 
geographic and category expansion, should deliver a long-term double-digit 
growth opportunity that is measured in decades. We reiterate our BUY rating and 
$24 price target and confidently foresee an above-average growth rate that 
justifies the current valuation. 

VALUATION 
Valuation is appropriate, in our view. Shares trade at 22x our 2013 EPS forecast 
and 11x our forecasted EBITDA. While the valuation represents a significant 
premium to the traditional food distribution peer group multiples (generally in the 
low teens on forward earnings and 7-8x EBITDA), the valuation is essentially in-
line with its best and only real comparable peer from a standpoint of growth, 

                                                                                   

                                                                                  84

                                              United Natural Foods (UNFI : NASDAQ : $49.29). We view UNFI as the best 
                                              comparison for CHEF given it also enjoys a naturally growing market, superior 
                                              margins relative to most distributors (yet at 18%, UNFI’s gross margins are 
                                              inferior to CHEF at 26%) and is the leader in its segment as is CHEF. We continue 
                                              to argue that CHEF should trade at a premium to its distribution peers (as UNFI 
                                              does) given its vastly superior margins, growth outlook and higher returns on 
                                              invested capital. 

                                              The shares are trading in line with our $24 price target, which is predicated on 
                                              the shares trading at about 11x F2013 EBITDA and is thus a near-term target. 
                                              We anticipate that share price appreciation should at least keep pace with 
                                              earnings and cash flow growth given our comfort with the current valuation on 
                                              the out year.

Investment risks 
Key risks that may impede the achievement of our forecasts and/or price target 
include the following: 

•  A rise in commodity prices: While normally beneficial for food distributors, 
   excessive commodity costs, which have been volatile over the last several 
   years, could alter consumption behavior and lower consumer demand. Major 
   products sold that have had their inputs fluctuate greatly are dairy, wheat, 
   flour, and cooking oils. Additionally, rises in fuel costs could negatively impact 
   CHEF's operations. 

•  Economic sensitivity: Given CHEF's focus on higher end food service 
   establishments, the company is exposures to potential sales volatility as 
   consumer confidence and spending fluctuation. Recent concerns surrounding 
   incremental economic weakness have impacted the performance of the 
   shares. 

•  Competitive activity: Despite its favorable positioning in specialty foods, 
   competition in the food distribution industry is fierce and CHEF competes 
   with larger food companies with greater resources. Market leaders include 
   Sysco, U.S. Foodservices, Inc and United Natural Foods. 

•  Market concentration: CHEF operations are concentrated in six markets, 
   leaving the Company susceptible to economic downturns. As of the end of 
   2010, 66% of CHEF's total sales originated from the New York market.  

•  Acquisition and integration risk: CHEF has made several acquisitions over its 
   history and it remains a key growth initiative. The specialty foods distribution 
   industry is highly fragmented and the Company has indicated plans for future 
   acquisitions. Future acquisitions could strain management resources; result in 
   sales disruptions or loss of key personnel and the company may not achieve 
   expected cost reductions or distribution gains.  

•  Product recalls and/or food safety concerns: CHEF products are ingested and 
   any concern about food safety or quality can impair consumer confidence in 
   the brands sold through CHEF. The risk of adverse health impacts is always 
   present.  

•  Industry regulation: CHEF's line of business is highly regulated at the federal, 
   state and local levels, and its specialty food products and distribution 
   operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. Suppliers are also 
   subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. In addition, as a 
   distributor of specialty food products, CHEF is subject to increasing 
   governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the 
   sale, packaging and marketing of natural and organic products 

                                                                                   

                                                                                   87

                                                                   1 May 2012 

                                                                                     
•  Weather: Adverse weather conditions can significantly impact CHEF's ability 
   to profitably and efficiently conduct its operations and, in severe cases, could 
   result in its trucks being unable to make deliveries or cause the temporary 
   closure or the destruction of one or more of its distribution centers. 

In addition, we strongly urge investors to review the complete set of risk factors 
that can be found in The Chefs' Warehouse's most recent regulatory filing. 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

                                                                                     

                                                                                    88
