completion of a sufficient capital raise to diminish concerns that   Exhibit 1 
Tesla would have insufficient capital to produce and ship the        Tesla Model X 
Model S, fund the design of the Model X, and build a

We would also view as an incremental positive if strategic 
partners Daimler, Toyota or Panasonic invest additional capital.  
Note that foreign entities would have to file HartScott Rodino

                                                                    April 7, 2011 
                                                                    Tesla Motors Inc. 

(5) Road test reports of the Model S could be on newsstands 
as early as 4Q11.  A positive review could reduce skepticism 
that deliveries will begin on time in mid-2012 and would likely 
increase the pace of reservations.  We forecast that by the time 
Model S production begins, Tesla will have over 6,500 
reservations, creating a backlog of nearly six months of 
production.   

 (6) Quarterly earnings, expected the first week of May.  Key 
metrics are Model S reservations, Roadster sales volumes and 
ASPs, progress on Model S production ramp, R&D and capex 
spending.  We expect 400 new Model S reservations in the 
quarter, equal to the run rate in 4Q10, bringing total 
reservations to 3,800.  For Roadster sales, we expect forecast 
145 units at an average ASP of $126k, also inline with 4Q10.  
Our EPS forecast of ($0.57) is below consensus of ($0.52) as 
we expect higher investment in R&D near-term.  In our view, 
disappointing quarterly earnings would likely drive the stock 
lower, but a positive earnings surprise is less likely to be a 
major catalyst than those detailed above.   

Valuation methodology and risk discussion.  We argue 
Tesla cannot be valued on near-term multiple metrics like 
traditional auto companies given that we expect Tesla to 
multiply revenues by over 20x from 2010 to 2015e, by more 
than 80x by 2020e and over 150x by 2025e.  We have thus 
chosen a 15-year time horizon for our DCF which captures the 
full utilization of Teslas manufacturing capacity in Fremont, the 
full maturation of the Model S, Model X (and top-hat 
derivatives) and also the ramp up of its mass market electric 
vehicle (the Gen 3).  We have applied a 12% WACC with a 
range of 10% to 14%.  The terminal value accounts for around 
60% to 70% of the total DCF value across the range of 
methodologies we have applied to arrive at our $70 PT.  The 
risks of lagging EV adoption, launch delays and balance sheet 
difficulties make Tesla a highly speculative investment.

                                                   Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                   uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                   regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                   leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                 
                                                   basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                   from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.
