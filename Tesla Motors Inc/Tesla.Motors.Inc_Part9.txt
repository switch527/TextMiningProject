Positives for Tesla on the call / in the quarter: 

•   Stronger  than  expected  sales  of  Roadsters  (145  cars)  and  powertrain 
     components delivered record sales of $49M. 
•   TSLA  raised  revenue  guidance  from  $160-$175M  to  $170-$185M  for 
     2011,  partially  due  to  the  higher  number  of  battery  packs  ordered  by 
     Daimler.   
•   Gross margins of 36.8% exceeded expectations as margins from lumpy 
     development services sales were far higher than expected.   
•   Model  S  reservations  grew  ~1,300  from  12/31  through  4/30  to  reach 
     ~4,600.   
 
Negatives for Tesla on the call / in the quarter: 

•   No new OEMs.  Since Roadster sales are ending at YE11, and there will be 
     no  Model  S  sales  before  mid-2012,  shouldn’t  expanding  powertrain 
     component sales / expanding OEM relationships be an important step in 
     growing revenue?  This is the second consecutive quarter that Tesla has 
     not added any new partnerships.   
•   Did the Model S beta delivery slip just a little?  First it was mid-summer 
     and now it is the end of summer?  We may be nitpicking but where are all 
     the promised extra details about the road driving tests?  Do they have 
     anything to do with the beta introduction sliding just a bit?   
•   Retail strategy is still murky.  We do not understand the appeal of the 
     distribution model.  TSLA will stop selling Roadsters in 8 months, has no 
     plans to advertise (at least today) and there is no Model S to test drive?  
     So let me understand this…you go to the store not to buy a car, not to 
     drive a car and not to see the product (since it not even available yet)?  
     But Tesla claims there are thousands of people creating foot traffic at 
     these stores.  It must be the rarified air and really good lattes.

Conclusion – Sometimes it is hard to poke holes when 
everything is so rosy 

We have never listened to a company discuss their business that is running 
so  smoothly  and  yet  lost  $49M  on  the  bottom  line.    There  was  not  one 
negative expression or utterance on the call. But since there were so few 
details on operations, alpha prototype test results, new partnerships, etc. we 
guess it is hard to be anything but positive since  so many people will be 
driving $80K electric vehicles next year, assuming they are available for sale.  
Just ask Fisker how that time frame is working out.  We do not mean to be so 
glib but we now count 18 auto OEMs that plan to have or will have an EV 
available for sale by the end of 2012.  So why are so many car buyers willing 
to pay TSLA a 25% gross margin per car as management confidently states 
they will reach on the Model S?  We would certainly demand a lower price if 
we thought that was the profit an auto OEM were going to make and said it 
right  to  our  face.    We  would  use  the  expected  media  hype  and  bullish 
commentary to exit positions should the stock bounce above $30.    

 

INVESTMENT RISK 
Tesla faces intense competition from established auto OEMs, execution risk 
for   Model   S,   lack   of   widespread   EV   adoption,   potential   reduction   in 
government support and continued operating losses.   
 
VALUATION METHODOLOGY 
We value TSLA using 3 metrics - EV/S, EV/EBITDA and a 5-year DCF. Our 
$19 target price is the average relative multiples and our DCF - using 15x 
terminal EBITDA multiple and 14% WACC.
