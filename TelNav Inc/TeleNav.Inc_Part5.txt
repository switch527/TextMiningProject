                                                                                                                                                                      April 29, 2011
 
     For Q411, we have increased our expense estimates to $27.6M, up   from $26.9M, which is near the upper end of guidance provided   by 
     management at between $27M and $28M. 
     Based on current evidence, it appears that Telenav performance is  exceeding our expectations, and  it does not appear that there  are any 
     known bumps along the way (at least in the short-term). As a result, we are also increasing our revenue estimate for FY12 to $                                                242.1M, 
     up from our previous FY12 estimate of $230.5M. Our new FY12 esti mate infers a 15% YoY growth ra te from our new FY11 estimate  of 
     $209.7M. We maintain a 15% YoY growth forecast, which is consistent with our previous forecast but from a higher base. 
     The quarterly trajectory accelerated slightly in H212 due to th  e potential impact of China Mobi le deployments, which appear to  be on 
     schedule. Our Q112 revenue forecast increases to $56.2M, up from our previous FY12 estimate of $53.5M. 
UPSIDE POTENTIAL TO OUR FORECAST 
     Even as we increase our forecasts, there are potential upside events that could positively impact performance: 
        o   Although the Delphi contract is baked into our estimates, there is a possibility that TNAV could sign new automotive OEM partne rs, 
             or expand its relationship with current clients like Ford. 
        o   The Verizon iPhone 4 program could take off. 
        o   New international mobile operators could come online within the next four quarters. 
        o   New advertising, commerce, and value-added services partnerships could come online. 
        o   Telenav may leverage its balance sheet to make accretive acquisitions. 
     Based on the potential for new opportunities for Telenav over the   next few quarters, there is a chance that it could grow by mo  re than 
     15% during FY12. Between FY10 and FY11, the company should gr  ow by about 19% based on its current FY11 guidance, so there i  s 
     evidence that Telenav could grow by more than 15%. 
VALUATION 
     Consistent with our recent initiating report, we are valuing the company based on a 7x FY12 EV/EBITDA multiple, which is inlin e with the 
     median of its immediate peers at 7.2X FYE+ 1 EV/EBITDA multiple. Considering that its growth trajectory and EBITDA margins are b  oth 
     higher than the peer set, and it does not look like it is declining any time soon, we argue that Telenav should be valued at le                                                       ast 
     equivalent to the peer set. Currently Telenav has no debt with                              $211.3M of cash  and cash equiva                  lents and trades at 3.2X FY12 
     EV/EBITDA. Based on a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple  of our new FY12 EBITDA estimate of $82.1M, up from $79.4M, the implied share price                                                           
     calculates to $18.90.  As a result, we reiterate our BUY recommendation, and  increase our 12-month share price target to 
     $18.90 from $16.80. The implied return from yesterdays closing share price is 65%. 
     Our EV/EBITDA multiple valuation is supported by our DCF model   calculation, which values the co mpany at $19.18 based on a disco unt 
     rate of 11.5% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. 
RISKS 
     We believe that we have properly estimated expenses, although th e company has stated that there is upward pressure on wages in  both 
     China and in the Valley. 
     China Mobile may not roll-out as expected, although indications are that it is on target. 
     Although it is declining, Telenav has customer concentration risk, with over 70% of revenues coming from two large clients. 
     The mobile sector is exceptionally litigious, and Telenav may need to defend its IP position against a third-party, which could                                                  impair 
     margins. 
     The competitive landscape could shift unexpectedly, impairing short-term performance.
