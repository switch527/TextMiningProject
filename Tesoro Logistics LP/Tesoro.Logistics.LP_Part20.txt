Investment Thesis

We believe TLLP represents the first opportunity in several years to own a 100% fee-based (low-risk) MLP with significant dropdown and
organic  growth  potential  early  in  its  life  cycle.  We  forecast  double-digit  distribution  growth  CAGR  for  the  next  several  years  as  TLLP
expands organically and completes acquisitions. Assets include a large crude oil gathering system in North Dakota and Montana that
provides  exposure  to  Bakken  formation  growth.  We  believe  the  Bakken  is  in  the  very  early  stages  of  development  and  that  TLLP
provides one of the most concentrated ways to invest in Bakken production.

Price Target Calculation

Our price target of $30 per unit is derived using our distribution discount model (DDM). The assumptions underlying this price target are
stage one (years 1 & 2) growth of 10%, stage two (years 3-5) growth of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 8.0%.
The terminal distribution is projected to be $2.06 and is achieved in 2016.

Key Risks to Price Target
n  Weak refined product demand
n  Potential to overpay for acquisition
n  Acquisition integration
n  Rising interest rates
n  Economic weakness
n  Capital markets access
n  Major change in MLP tax code
n  FERC regulatory risk
n  Conflicts of interest between LPs and GPs
n  Counterparty credit risk
n  Energy infrastructure overbuild
n  Extreme weather
n  A unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be viewed as having sold the
   units. Unitholders who want to be assured of keeping their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from
   a  loan  to  a  short  seller  should  consider  modifying  any  brokerage  account  agreements  to  prohibit  their  brokers  from
   borrowing their units. Because of the nature of the MLP structure, all investors should consult a qualified tax counsel
   before making an investment in the sector.
