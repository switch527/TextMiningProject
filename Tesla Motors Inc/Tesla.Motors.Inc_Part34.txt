                    De-risking execution.  In our view, the biggest risk to 
                    Teslas success is whether they can execute on 
                    manufacturing ramp-up to deliver the Model S on time, 
                    on budget, and to promised specs in mid-2012.  
                    Partnerships with Toyota, Daimler, and now Panasonic 
                    reduce that risk by giving Tesla access to supply chains 
                    and by aligning incentives with critical suppliers.   

                    Adoption still unknowable.  The second biggest risk 
                    for Tesla is whether consumers will buy electric-only 
                    vehicles in sufficient numbers.  We forecast Model S 
                    sales of 20,000 units by 2014, slightly less than 1% of 
                    total sales for all mid and high-end sedans.  For context, 
                    traditional performance sedans such as the Mercedes 
                    Benz E class, the BMW 5-series, and the Audi A6 each 
                    sell over 200,000 units in a mid-cycle year, but hybrid 
                    sales account for less than 3% of total autos.   
                                                                                           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with

                                                    Morgan Stanley ModelWare is a proprietary analytic framework that helps clients 
                                                    uncover value, adjusting for distortions and ambiguities created by local accounting 
                                                    regulations. For example, ModelWare EPS adjusts for one-time events, capitalizes operating 
                                                    leases (where their use is significant), and converts inventory from LIFO costing to a FIFO 
                                                  
                                                    basis. ModelWare also emphasizes the separation of operating performance of a company 
                                                    from its financing for a more complete view of how a company generates earnings.

STOCK RATINGS 
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). 
Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the 
equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since 
Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley 
Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as 
investment advice.  An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) 
and other considerations. 
Global Stock Ratings Distribution 
(as of October 31, 2010) 
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside 
our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we 
cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative 
weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy 
recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
