Is Daimler spreading its bets or could it replace Tesla?   
 
The  announcement  of  a  partnership  between  Daimler  and  Robert  Bosch 
GmbH to jointly develop an all new electric vehicle drive train to be used in 
new Mercedes Benz and Smart EVs starting in 2012 if all goes to plan.  In 
particular Daimler has been somewhat behind other major auto OEMs in 
developing EVs.  For example, despite the availability of the Smart fortwo in 
a number of locations in the U.S. the car has received a lot of grief for its 
limited top speed (~62 m.p.h.) and expensive purchase and lease financing 
($2,500 down, $599/month for a typical 4-year lease).  Compare this to a 
2011 Nissan Leaf that costs ~$350/month to lease with $2,000 down.

Figure 1 shows a diagram of Bosch’s EV powertrain, a newer version of which 
may be the backbone of the pending joint venture between Robert Bosch and 
Daimler.  The  Bosch  powertrain  includes  a battery  and  charger. Currently 
Tesla  supplies  battery  packs  and  chargers  that Daimler  uses  in  its  Smart 
fortwo EV.  While currently only a small portion of Tesla’s current revenue, 
we  believe  Tesla  was  hoping  to  expand  upon  its  current  agreement  with 
Daimler but this new relationship may place such an expansion at risk.   
 
Management suggested on the last earnings call in February that it with their 
focus on the Model S, the OEM partnership to develop the all EV Rav-4 with 
Toyota and the existing Daimler agreement they were not likely to pursue 
other large OEM partnerships (even though they had discussions).  Perhaps 
if the Daimler relationship diminishes Tesla would  have the capacity and 
inclination to pursue other OEM deals.  We shall see.

INVESTMENT RISK 
Tesla faces intense competition from established auto OEMs, execution risk 
for   Model   S,   lack   of   widespread   EV   adoption,   potential   reduction   in 
government support and continued operating losses.   
 
VALUATION METHODOLOGY 
We value TSLA using 3 metrics - EV/S, EV/EBITDA and a 5-year DCF. Our 
$19 target price is the average relative multiples and our DCF - using 15x 
terminal EBITDA multiple and 14% WACC.
