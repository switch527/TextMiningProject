                                          •   The breakdown of total sales growth into organic growth, and the impact owing to 
                                               acquisitions and inflation. Additionally, some color on trends in unique customers. 

                                          •   Some color on the state of the consumer and, as a result, the health of the restaurant 
                                               operators that CHEF serves.

                                          •   Update on the roll-out of the warehouse management system to the remaining facilities. 

                                          •   Managements thoughts on the opportunity for new market entries  specifically, how 
                                               many markets can the company ultimately enter and an outline of the criteria 
                                               management uses to evaluate potential markets. 

                                     In 4Q11, our estimates remain at EPS of $0.  26 and EBITDA of $9.8 million. Consensus 
                                     EPS is $0.25    . Our estimate assumes total sales increase 18.0% to $117.1 million  driven by 
                                     9% organic sales growth, and we assume gross margins expand 50bp to 26.5%. We forecast 
                                     operating expenses (excluding D&A) grow 27.8% to $21.2 million, no change from last years 
                                     margin of 18.1%  leading to a 78bp improvement in operating margins to 7.9%, or $9.2 
                                     million. This gets us to EBITDA of $9.8 million, a 50bp expansion in margin to 8.4%. We
